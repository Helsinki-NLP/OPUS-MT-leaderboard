The Civil Rights Movement issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Discrimination of Colorful People (NAACP) has published a warning for colourful people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory principles of the state and racist attacks.
‘The NAACP Travel Recommendations for the State of Missouri, with effect from 28 August 2017, calls on African-American passengers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay increased attention when travelling across the State as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents that are currently taking place throughout the State,’ says the Association.
The NAACP stated that it took this step on the basis of the current laws of the State of Missouri, which make it difficult to defend racistally motivated acts before a court, as well as the conduct of the authorities active in criminal proceedings, which disproportionately target minorities.
‘Citizen rights violations are taking place.
People are stopped by police because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," said the president of the NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel.
"We still have the biggest number of complaints."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the US state.
Among the incidents quoted by the organization were racially motivated abuses against students of black skin at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a man of black skin from Tennessee.
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of this year after he ran out of gas while travelling across the state, and the police put him in custody without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent declaration by the state's supreme state attorney, which states that black skin drivers have a 75% higher chance of stopping them by the police.
"The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be prepared - they should carry with them money to pay bail, if any, or alert their relatives that they are going to travel by the State."
According to current FBI numbers, there were hundreds of cases of hateful behavior in Missouri in 2015, reaching the state's 16th place among all states.
The travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue the company for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has issued a travel recommendation for Texas and Arizona after the States have approved an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which is intended to improve racial profiling under the ACPU.
The travel recommendation is usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but recently the advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Even after 12 years, her family has no peace!
The murdered is the model Sally Anne Bowman.
The girl from Croydon was murdered by chef Mark Dixi in 2005 directly at the restaurant she worked at, he planted stab wounds for her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana, then kill her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched a meticulous criminalist work of investigating the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to a 34-year sentence for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a juvenile in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead lying on the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were fighting a fatal night.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
"The cab driver also attracted attention," he said.
The girl, according to his statement, was supposed to defend herself, but she could, of course, in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven a lie and accused him.
After Dixie's confession, he talked about his hornyness and the taste of a girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to light marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at his ex-girlfriend's house drinking alcohol and taking the cocaine, which he told the police himself.
He said he smelled adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, which is why he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth," said the Mirror Linda.
And after 12 years, the family faces further attacks by the vandals destroying her grave.
He's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people on the loose who dig up these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," Linda told the Mirror mother of the deceased girl about the disappearance of the urn with the ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are neither prudent nor conservative," says Martin Raž, who operates the Prague Intimity boutique.
In it you will find designer and luxurious erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started out inconspicuously, about 12 years ago.
Martin Raž and his friends went on a cycling trip in Moravia.
One of them not only brought a bicycle, but also a box full of unusually looking vibrators.
"Different moles and dolphins, and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to cooperate with another partner with a German manufacturer of design erotic devices Fun Factory, which interested Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, Benediktská Street is operating in Prague, where it sells erotic aids in the way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why wouldn't I?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, that's what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
Oh, come on, don't be so puritans!
It was the Berlin Fun Factory store, designed by the renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as an inspiration for the boutique Intimity.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic business than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in a beautiful, decal style, products made more like perfume.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to consider how he could take the Prague trade, where he should be and what his name should be.
The name Intimity liked both of them.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it's i, you can say, tender," he says.
Followed by buying the internet domain and searching for a suitable space that went in parallel with different interior visualizations.
Finally, the variant that spread the shop into the garden of pleasure and the bedroom that guides the bed was won.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from FormaFatal.
We found space in 2013.
At first, he didn't seem perfect because he wasn't on the main street, but he was sitting in the name of Intimity.
It's intimate.
He's in the alley next to the main one, so no one's looking for customers," says Martin Raž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of having entered such a business at all.
When I entered the boutique of Intimity half an hour ago, the streets of evil were empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like going to the sex store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior that I know from boutiques with fashion.
Even though there's only a woman's service in the store, it doesn't mean that a man's leg doesn't come here to ask for help.
Most of the time, you guys come here to buy presents for your girlfriends.
"Men are usually unable to estimate the right size and vote rather larger," smiles Martin over a frequent mistake.
Those are the prejudices, the clichés that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man of good faith may choose a uselessly large vibrator.
Similarly, men choose mostly black underwear, while women tend to be rather pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product duly called Satisfyer.
From the look on my face, it must be clear that I don't know which one it is, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a contact-free clitoris stimulator.
There is a youthful need for me to embellish with admiration of the serious tone of interpretation.
It's like it wasn't snooping around.
And it's not really snooping around.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well accepted.
It's kind of the last revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a sea horse-shaped vibrator.
He made sure that women became more interested in the design of such products.
The other was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He has completely demolished the taboo that may persist in some men by seeing competition in erotic aids.
"Differences are being made," he continues.
With one engine, two engines, remote control.
It's a favorite category.
With a love connection, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a failure is the category of admixture vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose aids and buy classic vibrators, although they may only use it on the outside.
In Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to tell if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it'd have to be a little different.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." Most of all, the masturbater is sold, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "you sleep like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and experience during use.
In Japan, it's completely different.
It surprises me.
I thought the Japanese would have a lot of sex aids, I object.
"That's the Internet reality," I'm told.
The common one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more likely to be associated with women using them.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just to be interesting, what the Japanese brand Tenga, represented in the boutiques of Intimity, sells globally, forms still around half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
Czechs and Czechs are not prudish.
On the contrary, we're quite a helpful nation.
Definitely unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical client of the trade ranges between 35 and 50 years and "she already has a certain experience with sexual life, as well as with some tools.
She will come for something nicer, better to complement her partner life or for herself."Martin Raž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka take care of it by convincing each product that it is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to go into specialties such as bondage and latex, because we do not have the space to do that, but it is not appropriate here.
These things could discourage those we're trying to target.
Which is why there are people who have always had the shame of going to a sex store because they were afraid they'd get something like that.
A lot of products on the shelves are really nice.
It is also given by the selection of represented renowned brands.
Some have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever prized was the mentioned marine horse "and it triggered a change in the entire sector.
It started to drop from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with the healthless, they began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that the design of some is supported by the Czech Republic, a popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say, I'm quite surprised how many people buy this Whoop.de.doo design thing from Anna Mareš, even though it's relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus's Anna Mareš balls.
She has done a great deal of work within the Czech Republic and abroad by presenting exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started out as a schoolwork.
It is now a finished product, which is also produced in our country.
I wanted to control the production process and I also wanted to know what materials and how WHOOP.de.doo products are made.
Because it's not a big production, but a small series, it's definitely more expensive than a big series.
I may go a little against the current, but it seems important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could happen that in a few years we won't be able to produce anything anymore," Anna describes to me later the situation that she and Martin agree that our society is becoming more and more open.
He does not encounter a negative or adversarial attitude.
They're said to be desperate.
"But they will start smiling." Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator on offer that you can get a personal message for, and she's also planning her own lubrication gel this year.
In the next year, vibrating eggs and other news should be added.
The Borderline of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the limit of what's right lies.
Is there anything Martin Raž would no longer sell?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one, it may seem completely abnormal to another, so we're rather defining ourselves with a range of brand manufacturers.
None of them go into extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: What was the craziest demand they had?
Right now, an e-mail came in a week where some lady asked for a masturbation aid for her friend with a natural length of 28 centimeters.
So we had to write that we didn't have any of that.
The question is, did anyone make fun of us," Martin takes a suspicious look at me.
Even that happens from time to time...
Morning for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's!
His friend Karel Generous is fighting a serious disease.
Karl Gott's best friend fights a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it is unfortunately true," the singer confirmed the sad news to Lightning himself.
I know about my illness, and so far, I'm managing it pretty well, given the circumstances.
"I take medicines to slow down the disease," he added, saying, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The whole branched family came together to make life easier for Karl.
Eva's wife is trying to be at home as much as she can, and her daughter from the first marriage of Zuzana and Tereza, the son of Karel, Karlas, comes to her father's house on the White Mountain.
Generous fought cancer twice, and he also gave his experience to Slavík to support him in his difficult treatment.
He's had 60 chemo.
He was able to get back to work after them on the tennis court and ski slopes.
"From an astrologer, I have been foretold to be here until '90s," Karel said to Lightning.
He's a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of songs so I don't forget them," admitted Karel.
The same disease is now being fought by actress Květa Fialová in the institution.
Do you have an Alzheimer's patient in your family?
See how you treat him.
The Parliament of Chile has lifted the ban on interference, the law will judge the UN.
In Chile, an absolute ban on artificial abortion is still in place, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
"I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint to the Constitutional Court and that ten people will now decide what we have been arguing about in Parliament for more than two years," the Socialist Senator Isabel Allende complained.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members, and in the end of August it should be given a new President, who, according to the AFP, is close to the opposition.
A bill that disrupts the absolute prohibition of interference, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on 19 July.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it believed it was violating the right of an unborn child to live.
Members of the vote on the bill were postponed last month until it was examined by a mixed parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, the Members approved the proposal and did so again to the Senate.
According to the new legislation, there should be no longer criminal artificial abortion in three cases: if the life of a woman is threatened if the foetus has no hope of survival or if the pregnancy is created by rape.
There were similar exceptions, according to the Spanish newspaper El País, in Chile, since 1931, before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
The absolute ban on interference in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the President's office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where the absolute prohibition of interference applies.
Others are Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women in prison serving up to 30 years of imprisonment for abortion.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion that the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty
The unscrupulous sign of change in the regime is the criticism of the statues.
Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else - see the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein's statue at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of Trump's regime, certainly knew what he was up to when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on President's proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set out with a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty.
It's nice to say Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
It would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903, a plaque with the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was placed on the base, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller reproved Acosta with the words: “I do not want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that has been placed on the base in addition, and to which you refer, is not part."
Miller's actually right, but as he said himself, this isn't about history.
These are the striking words of Emma Lazarus, who are resonating today - not only the immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let who has fallen, who can barely breathe freely, who can breathe in the midst of poor cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better watch these "poor worms" on our screens than ever.
Miller wasn't trying to criticise poetry - he wanted to make it clear that these people aren't welcome in the U.S.
This conflict about the meaning of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends, who, after her death, sought to plant a plaque with poems on the base of the statue, knew quite well that she was going into a high political game.
The statue was to express the connection between the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, i.e. the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of exiles.
Combining a poem with the image of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long been trying to reverse that meaning.
Known commentator Rush Limbaugh - Jan the Baptist on Trump's taking up power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents an early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the behind world: “The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
It brings out the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States."
Limbaugh is surprisingly referring to an important issue.
The meaning of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of a exhausted and damned passenger who often, after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, comes with hope in the heart to a new country.
It is literally a view of the world by the eyes of those who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, a statue of hope expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And, of course, that's a perspective that Miller and Trump certainly don't recognize.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Cup in athletics 2017: Neil Black peje praises the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
The head of the United Kingdom's athletic federation Neil Black stated that the strong 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be "a huge asset for the team".
For MS in London 2017, starting on Friday, a record number of Scottish athletes was selected.
Black believes that in Scotland "something is going on" and British athletics can only learn from Scots.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it," Black said.
“I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British athletics: it has something to do with what they've done.
That's what people on the streets think.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing."
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in a race of 5000 meters, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“A number of athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room feeling enormously proud and motivated.
The passion and the hidden feelings that Eilidh spoke to were unrepeatable."
The silver medalist Commonwealth, who will compete across obstacles of 400 m at her fifth world championship, stated that she is "unbelievably" that there are 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The runner Muirová has only set five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will take part in the run at 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the course on 1500 m. This season, he won British team races and annual games.
Doyle remembers her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The team captain pointed out that she is “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues have entered the team, but in many cases they will also attack at the finals and medals.
"Unusual to the team captain's position is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is a pleasure," she added.
“I’m obviously very proud of all the Scots who got on the team.
It proves where we moved to.
They're athletes who'll think about the front seats on the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out that we can be proud of this year's championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of domestic fans and to enjoy the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race, and I'm gonna enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking critics on Facebook: don't apply for a public function unless you can handle the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take the newspapers long to start criticizing him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he wasn't trying to silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said: “The freedom of speech can be taken away from us - and the foolish and dumb will be led as sheep to defeat. ”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on getting him to start acting like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued for the above-mentioned acts by the American Union for Civil Liberties.
The governor's employees rejected the action as unfounded, and in the comments on the Internet, there were many opinions of the type "who cares".
“It’s just Facebook,” said many users.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
It is an extremely popular Republican governor in an absolute democratic state.
He may boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not hot.
As you can see, he controls his own state with certainty and strictly respects the principles.
It turns out that it is also skillful to use Facebook as the main means to connect with its voters - there is no exception to the publication of the first photo with a head cane after receiving chemotherapy.
The blocking of people who visit the governor's site - which is a public forum, marked as official and managed by its employees paid for by taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with Washington Post, spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor, with the fact that the blocking of the comments took place from the position of moderation of the contributions.
But it is too easy to use an image of Internet trolls, spammers, or angry people.
Washington Post interviewed some of the real people who had been erased.
And that's exactly what they are - the real people who speak to their chosen leaders; the teacher, the entrepreneur and the pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible as appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani's attorney, Md., asked about hate crime, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crime and other up-to-date news," she wrote in the commentary section of the Washington Post.
"I do not like the idea that as soon as a number of people comment on the same subject, some people are identified as promoting a collective effort rather than being recognised as a larger group of interested citizens."
What the governor's employees called "centred spam interest" would most likely call "defence".
Modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage contributions by blocking criticisms or deleting negative comments.
It is much more comfortable than in the past, when the same procedure would require the sending of workers to the streets where they would collect and burn all copies of criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's going on, in digital form only.
Hogan is not the last public agent to be criticised for dishonoring Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born in Virginia last week.
According to County Judge James C. Cacherise, Loudoun County Board of Supervisors broke the first amendment in Alexandria, where it prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In Washington's time, the postman's price was almost the same as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily press has quadrupled, and many anonymous writers have questioned his position as leader.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, under pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected by people in the framework of the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were built up in his office to criticise his position against the agreement of the Treatment of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and intimidation lie in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept that.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, they use more data abroad than at home.
In foreign countries, the Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holiday they have more time to browse on the web, and under the umbrella they do not usually have the opportunity to join the Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and a smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at home prices.
This results from the fresh O2 statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available in the framework of the check-in than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where the minimum of our customers travels through winter, data consumption increased even 50 times this summer.
In the second place, Italy was placed in the database of the data consumed.
The Czechs call from Germany for the most minutes, where many go to work during the summer.
Croatia will visit 800 thousand Czechs annually according to the data of the Association of Czech Tourist Offices, so it is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was this July 7th.
"Tens of millions of photographs would be included in the data transmitted," said the director of the mobile segment at O2 Silvia Cieslarová.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria is first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is only the fourth and Italy is the sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, on which we do not have so much time for browsing on the Internet.
"Beyond Austria, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic," Cieslarová explained.
While the data was recorded by the operator after the release of roaming charges by high year-on-year growth, the increase in telephone calls is much lower.
The number of minutes called in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany dominates with a huge lead in front of other countries.
"Roaming calls are used by company customers on business trips," Cieslarová said.
Ronan Rafferty hopes in the home atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
In the next three days, Ronan Rafferty’s former golfer will hope for a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative area of East Lothian, which hosts the 25th annual Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year at the nearby golf course Archerfield Links on his way to the finals he has submitted to Paul Eales. This year he will perform the role of the Ambassador of the tournament in the representation of the founder of the club and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of me and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” said Rafferty.
“Players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is a keen advocate for this game and proud of his successes.
This year's tournament is in the right hands."
Englishman Eales will first defend the championship title, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I have a good feeling about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I had no opportunity to defend my victory at Extremadura Open, because a year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
The return to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place to golf.
I remember last year when Sharon really meant a lot to me and my wife.
It was a beautiful time I'd never forget."
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region, returns to his home ground.
This event will be his first participation from Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I'm always happy to play on home soil," Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want to succeed and feel great pressure.
I really like to play again, and I think I'm doing great.
I'm happy with the results so far."
The three players will also be joined on the course by the former Masters Ian Woosnam winner and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty..
Orr and former Captain of the Ryder Cup Sam Torrance competition are among the six Scottish players on the course; others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entry fee for the tournament is free. Parking is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be devoted to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Land of Indonesia of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in Papua Province of Indonesia, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the words of local "nota" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he will take out the potato and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on a muddy country - a house is not equipped with furniture - where she does her daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof is filling the toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was no longer assigned any field to work.
Polygamy is common here.
The late-night work poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"In the afternoon after 5 o'clock, no one is allowed to roam around the village," says Bardina.
It is a rare view of everyday life on the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public raise before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarti government, which controlled the whole region, with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - an independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a distant and devastated city where you can get after a 90-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabire, and then a five-hour drive away.
Mass traffic isn't working in this place.
The city, with 19 000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of wool sheets in shades of grey and rusty colors.
Very few Indonesians looked at this place, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, locals worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these dresses," says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-wrought turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia - 28% of the population lives below the poverty line and child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the country of Indonesia of gold.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grassberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoeenix, is located only 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153 000 inhabitants.
Only in 2015, Freeport mined gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports wood mining at an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, this wealth is a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by the mighty Indonesian army.
In 2005, the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including the amount of $150,000 per officer.
The parrots calling for self - administration threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
More than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, according to human rights activists, and thousands of others have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
Mass murders in Papua Tribal Area during the 1970s were equal to genocide, as reported by the Asian Commission for Human Rights.
Only last year did Indonesian police arrest more than 3900 peaceful Protestants in the region.
In Will Lose Everything, the 2016 British Archdiocese report describes the cruelty that occurred last year as an extrajudicial execution, torture - according to another report is particularly popular rape and electrocution - and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrators.
"It is difficult to calculate the number of victims because there are incidents every week," said Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation has been aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% report Christianity, but demography changes with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands - Java, Bornea, Sumatry and Sulawesi.
The Java canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
"Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans," explains twenty-four-year-old Abeth You, who was born in Paniai and moved to Jayapura Province for work.
"The original people of Papua-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma lost their jobs."
In the course of his presidential campaign in 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, named Jok, promised to address the inequality and violations of rights.
The former carpenter secured and secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and local people feel betrayed.
"Our heart was broken because in 2014, we voted for Jokpwi, hoping to hear our call for justice," said You.
The fact is, just two months after the October inauguration of Jakowi, Paniai was shocked.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs near the camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised kids told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this reproach and tone and later returned with four other soldiers, said local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state chased a group of children and beat them with their guns, presented victims and witnesses to the event.
One of the soldiers fired on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to an election commission near the building, and the next day, things were getting worse.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field outside the local police station and military headquarters and demanded justice.
They came with ritual hunting bows and performed a waita dance - where they run in a circle and mimic the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants started throwing stones at the buildings.
With increasing tension, soldiers were ordered over radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to shoot,” said TIME weekly in an official document, whose content has never been published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), Head of Enarotali Kigo Koto District, recognized the dangers and called on the residents to move to their homes.
However, no one had heeded his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," said TIME weekly on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but according to his words, the bullet belonged to one of the present soldiers.
“There were a lot of people around, and there was a lot of shooting,” he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to see that it was really him," said the weekly TIME with the sad voice of Yohanes, who uses only one name as many Indonesians.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told journalists that his officers were merely "assuring" a station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us," said the spokesperson of the Papuaan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiya, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The murder report pleased Jakart media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokov gave a passionate speech in Jayapura and expressed his understanding of the families of the victims and promised to deal with violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that it would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve past acts of violence.
But excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the violent acts have happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be a simple task," he said.
However, in an interview on June 5th for the magazine TIME, held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he was not planning to take action in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought before the court. ”
Wiranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, stated that 11 human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, had been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with distrust.
"I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but I have not yet seen anything," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
As he says, several years after that, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many of the people of Paniai who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to his words, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army began looking for me," he said.
And the shooting's not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at the villagers in nearby Deiyai.
A struggle with which one person died and another 17 injured occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw (24), who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw at the relevant stones and the answers were a warning shooting.
However, locals claim that the mobile brigade (the Indonesian paramilitary police) began to shoot in the crowd and killed one person.
"There was a panic, we were afraid of payback," said Time 29-year-old Domingg Badia, who lived near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded.
"I haven't left the house in two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has requested the punishment of police officers involved and the withdrawal of mobile brigades from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM) - an army of rebels protecting Papuan rights by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the leaders of the OPM are from Paniai, not from Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Komiya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitraryly detained thousands of people in Paniai, all under the pretext of "assuring national sovereignty".
Some of them will never see again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as "a tragic and forgotten place".
The oil in the fire feeds on poverty.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is still unattainable.
Locals grow their food: sweet potatoes, fruit and foliage.
Women work in the fields; each earns four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvests are designed for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened several air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, economic inequality between the native Papua and immigrants has increased.
As few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and richer immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education needed to get into business.
"Young people move out of villages because of lack of job opportunities and money," said John Gobai, Chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.
By isolation, Papua Province is hidden from the world.
There are also strict rules for foreign journalists.
At the beginning of this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basel Longchamp - were expelled from the parrot because of "no cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they received such a rare permit for filming.
In his election campaign, Phelim Kine, Deputy Director of the Asian Human Rights Watch, promised to abolish the strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development.
“For foreign journalists who work in the most rebellious areas of Papua and West Papua, there is a high risk of non-recognition of visas and blacklisting,” he said.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that the international pressure on Indonesian in Papua is largely limited.
In March there were six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - the UN Human Rights Council on the investigation of "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
In the past, these countries have also supported the OPM.
Arrmanath Nasir, spokesperson of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, lost the charge when he told the journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media are free, so it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people call for foreign governments.
When the official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on 4 May, the local people called, according to the source, which also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan "we want freedom".
Another election is scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the parrots say they won't vote for Jokovi.
"Jokov is a man who has good intentions, but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai," said Gobau, President of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokov to know that the people of Paniai - besides living in constant fear of a robberic army - are rolling in poverty, poor education, and a health system.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their voice as a “debt” that Jok must pay back.
"They do not want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Panai shooting, they continue in the last symbolic act of resistance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and military stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done for enough, at least they won't let responsible persons forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has picked up a huge shipment of cocaine in Australia.
In the Pacific Sea, the French Navy has seized a $1.46 million worth of cocaine.
The shipment was headed for Australia.
In the course of the intervention, a four-man ship crew, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and after being detained, was dragged to a port in Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service stated that, in cooperation with its international partners, it would seek to determine exactly where and where the drugs were going and to reveal the "Lithuania Syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures that have stopped a large number of drugs going to Australia," said its Executive Director, Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for their smugglers due to high street prices.
The country also faces the problem of the growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current raid is not the first.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, trying to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
Seniors don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem can be in homes for seniors, according to a doctor from Geriatric Clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavla Mádlová could be an infusion of physiological solution that is injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But they only apply in medical facilities so far.
The older you get, the more water in your body goes down.
"In addition, they lose their thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and are rapidly dehydrated," Mádlová said.
I'm sure they should drink two liters.
"But getting so much fluid into an old person is a big problem," she added.
In the homes for seniors, she often says that no doctor is watching.
In hospitals, it deals with dehydration by regular infusions.
"I think that even there should be gradually introduced so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-litre bottles of saline can be supplied to old people in a day.
A lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest itself as a total loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day, the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused," she said.
In case of negligence, it may result up to a stroke.
The blood will thicken and block the blood vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered in sheets, maximum cotton sheets.
One-time diapers may also be a problem.
"It is more difficult for a nurse, but it would be ideal to discover the patient and let the skin vent," said the doctor.
The Torch skyscraper burned for the second time in Dubai
In Dubai, one of the world’s largest skyscrapers was caught in flames on Friday. Firemen had to evacuate all residents of 337 meters high and 79 floors.
In the last two years, it has been the second fire of this high-rise building that bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All the residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries, the cause of the fire is unknown.
"We slept and woke up the alarm. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," said Reuters Georgoge, one of the residents of the skyscraper.
Dubai's civil defense reported that the firemen managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 a.m. (0:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they provided replacement accommodation for disabled residents.
The incident could once again create a discussion about the safety of materials used to cover buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation initiated by the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damage was to the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
The British police reported that the system of isolation and lining of the London Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire during the June fire, in which nearly 80 people were killed.
The survey showed that more than one of the five passengers to the United States are carrying prohibited items on board an aircraft.
A passenger survey showed that more than twenty percent of them knowingly or unwittingly introduced prohibited items through the control post of the U.S. Government Agency Transport Security Administration on board aircraft.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have found out that they were traveling late with a gun, ammunition or explosives.
The results of the survey carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which was answered by more than 1000 respondents - showed that younger passengers are more likely to breach the rules.
The respondents who admitted that they attempted knowingly to travel with an object prohibited by TSA were 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours of flight compared to less than 15 percent of the members of the Generation X.
Food and alcohol are among the most common objects that have escaped the attention of TSA.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly gave a sharp subject over surveillance, while 2.2 percent of the women questioned and 3.7 percent of the men questioned also admitted that they deliberately put the prohibited drugs on board.
The company stated that it was carrying out research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally made illegal items through airport controls and how much it had done on purpose.
It is not surprising that most people who have carried illegal objects - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company emphasised, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what kind of fluids they can put on a plane.
No surprise, then, that TSA confiscated the most prohibited fluids.
For some time, people thought that TSA would deal with books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Fluid transport is permitted on domestic flights, not international flights.
Head of EPA Scott Pruitt on the postponement of planned directives to reduce Obama’s emissions
After 15 States were sued by the Environmental Protection Agency, her boss Scott Pruitt dismissed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration's plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan, responding more quickly than the previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal appeal against his previous position in the federal appeal court.
This concerns the last deadline, which was set for 1 October, when Member States should start to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan in order to avoid "intervention with local decisions or threatening economic growth".
Pruitt, who, before becoming the head of the EPA, was President Donald Trump, served as State Attorney General for Oklahoma for a long time as a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed the regulation proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden Wednesday turnover is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA executive exceeded his authority in an attempt to postpone the integration of Obama administration's plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leakage.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of the ozone standards and strengthened the EPA's commitment to work with the States through complex processes and compliance with new standards within a given time frame.
"The previous administration of the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and set plans," said Pruitt, who, in his previous position, filed more than a dozen actions against the EPA.
“We do not believe in regulation by means of court disputes and we take the term seriously.
We never joke about our statutes and the authority that results from them."
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point use "the possibility of delay and any other legally available authority" to ensure that the regulation "will be based on sound policy and the most accessible information".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more extensive transcription of ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to postpone implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has still not been passed by the Senate.
New York's Attorney General Eric Schneidererman, head of the coalition of states suing the EPA this week, stated that the group was not going to allow legal pressure.
"The turnover of EPAs - following our judicial review - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution," said Schneidererman.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone arises when normal harmful substances released by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resultant smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists are thriving with gratitude to Pruitt's sudden change.
"It is worrying to see the pressure to change the thinking of responsible people and to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Centre of Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to struggle with the ideological campaign of Trump's administration, which seeks to help pollutors and special interests."
He's a man of acid, yet he's not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
One minute you're at home with your family and laughing, the next you suddenly change your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopher of Great Britain, whose face was glued with acid by an unknown assailant who was eventually released from guilt.
The information was provided by Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at the Christophers'.
Andreas got up to go open.
He thought there was probably a courier outside the door that was supposed to deliver Christmas gifts for the family that day.
Instead, there was a cruel surprise waiting for him.
The man he's never seen in his life, right after he opened it without warning, poured acid with the words, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I just felt an incredible pain in my skin," Andreas said.
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his loved ones learned a terrible message - according to the doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patients would be infected and threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face that doctors were trying to put together with skin from other parts of the patient's body was affected.
The loss of eyelids has become a major complication for Christopher.
It's probably the most annoying thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his distress.
Today Christopheros has had 12 surgeries that are far from the last.
The injuries suffered by acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, the victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people do not recover and fight distortion and disfigurement throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, spokesperson of the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopher is sure that the unsub must have mistook him.
The perpetrator believed that revenge was being taken by a man who sexually abused his close person.
The police properly investigated the case, and then tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the astonishment of Christopher’s family changed substantially.
"Three judges finally concluded that the sentence should be abolished because a man is not considered a threat to the public," said Christopheros.
Over the past few years, the number of infections with corrosive substances has increased considerably.
The Ministry of the Interior expressed its views on the issue by planning to set new guidelines for state officials regarding the classification of corrosives.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, victims of similar attacks are not willing to give up.
They demand that the UK Government impose stricter and longer sentences of imprisonment for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require that tight checks be made on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as they are different cleaners.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned the famous skyscraper The Torch, one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Danish civil defense, the residents of the 80-storey building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to the spokesman of the Dublin police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread up.
However, according to several residents of the house, this was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the highest floors and spread down with falling hot ruins.
We were asleep.
We were woken up by an alarm. People were screaming.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames seized about 40 flats.
On the ground, he destroyed at least two cars when the burning parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, according to a civilian defense message, the fire was able to get under control.
The cause of its origin is not yet known.
According to witnesses in the surrounding buildings, the power went out.
In February 2015, the dubaj skyscraper The Torch destroyed over a hundred flats.
There's about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, no one was hurt because they managed to evacuate the population in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became its 352 metre tallest residential building in the world.
He was taken by another oak skyscraper the next year.
The culturist had 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolito contained a variety of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix didn't help him with the title, ended in fourth.
Now, a bodybuilder is in danger of four years of distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian rugbist Davide Vasta was positively tested for 11 doping substances, which until then was a record amount for the affected athletes.
According to his words, the third player began to take steroids the year before he fell bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondračková in the Czech Republic.
She was passionately hugged with her ex-lover!
Only Lucka Vondráčková entered the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
And he's also got attention wherever he comes.
The last time she fell into her arms was a former lover, Michal Longy, who lived with him for three years.
The actor was 12 years older at the time, and he longed for a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly didn't want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went apart, but the friends remained to this day.
Which they also proved at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they were both in blue.
They didn't notice each other at first, but then they got close, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until she grabbed her belly.
After that, they hugged and posed the photographers willingly.
Their meeting was not a coincidence, however, because they will play a lovers' couple together in the new Prima series, Captain Exner.
Islamists have been given life in the UK for preparing the assassination.
On Thursday, the British court sent four members of an Islamist cell to prison for life called the Three Musketeers, and, according to the D.A.'s office, planned a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended the training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities thought that he was going to attack immediately.
One of the men in the car found a partial tube bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "unbelievers" in Arabic, and a gun maket.
This happened the moment a MI5 secret service agent placed a listening device in the car.
"The recent assassinations have shown the horror the defendants could have caused if they were not stopped," said Deputy Prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convictions aged 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convicted man 38 years old can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men claimed to be innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendant's claim.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
They measured 38.3 °C in Hodoninland.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Fahrenheit remained on top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees of centia recorded in Strážnice, Hodonínsko, it was overtaken by Thursday, which thus far became the warmest day of this year.
It was confirmed by employees of the Czech Hydrometorology Institute.
As opposed to Tuesday, however, on Thursday, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, the records for 35 out of 145 weather stations, measured over 30 years, were overrun or levelled.
Only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice, the temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In the Lednice in Břeclavsk on Thursday 37,4 degrees, the original maximum was four tenths of degrees and in Pohořelice in Brno the current 37,1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
In the west, it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the biggest heat in Dyjákovice was in Znojemsko and Broda nad Dyjí in Břeclav, where mercury came to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
For example, in western and northwest Bohemia, according to the ČHMO website, the highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Fahrenheit.
"Temperatures began to grow there later this afternoon," said the meteorologists.
The current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most of Moravia, however, high temperatures remain on Friday and southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing loses billions because of visa policy.
For decades, China has been trying to apply its influence without using force resources.
It spends ten billion dollars a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushes its entertainment industry to foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
But that's not going to work for Beijing.
The local state media are talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic change and modernisation.
However, the number of visitors increased by just 3.8 percent last year and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, inter alia, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome a foreigner with open arms, it evaluates the situation in the world's most populous country of economics professor of the Peking University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contacts with China, and the citizens of the others have to deal with the visa in advance.
Therefore, at the Chinese authorities in the USA, crowds are comparable to Chinese New Year's celebrations.
The visa costs $140, but if a person doesn't want to wait long hours in line, he has to pay $100 and more for extra services.
Such restrictions create significant economic obstacles.
The Journal of Economics and Finance study showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors per country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and lives less than one percent of all its population, visited 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens this problem by using tourism to achieve its political objectives, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China reduced traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans paid her back and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
This all affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US central bank of the Fed, China could leave China as a result of foreign travels of the Chinese up to $190 billion, while China will receive about $35 billion annually in sales to incoming tourists.
According to official numbers on balance of payments development, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, which is equal to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists in the country, which anxiously prevents the outflow of capital, poses a very painful blow.
However, the above factors are only one expression of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places, China has practically never heard of immigrants.
Even in 2013, fewer than a million foreigners lived in all of China.
Some individual cities have more in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the intersection of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific work shows that immigrants tend to boost economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
But you will not find them in China.
To solve these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian states, particularly India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and cheapen visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Plzeň Zoo, the reproducible reptiles were multiplied by deadly reptiles.
The Plzeň Kingdom of Jed can enjoy three precious, deadly reptiles of youth.
At the exhibition visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish vipers.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 metres.
"The length of the meter is growing," said zoo spokesperson Martin Vobruba.
Young people of the other two species, mortals and cobras of red, will be gaining strength in the garden.
We can't tell when people will see them yet.
"We wouldn't want to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying that it could take a year or two.
The Australian viper mortals came into the world eight, descendants of breeding couples from a population around Sydney.
"The one that visitors can see in the exhibition is among the mortals of Perth," said Vobruba, saying that in human care it is necessary to winter 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Fahrenheit.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a bunch of African spitting cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen Zoo hatched out of four eggs in a total of four cubs.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," added Vobruba.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, within a distance of up to four meters.
They're heading for the eyes, they can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feeds on mouse holates in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden they are still expecting hatching of the cubs from the mamba collection black, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unproven transcription of a telephone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The U.S. daily Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with Mexico's leaders and Australia.
In an interview on 27 January with Mexican President Enrique Peña Niet, Trump ordered him to stop publicly proclaiming that he would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The President of America blamed him for publicly condemning the building of the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press."
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern borders and announce that he would pay Mexico for it.
A transcript of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull escaped to the public, revealing a tight exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US agreement on the supervision of refugees headed to Australia was "studden" and "stuplic" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama's rule - would look "dumped" after he proposed a ban on the entry of refugees into the US.
Trump ended the call after Turnbullo explained that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk testified again at the prosecution for Smolensk.
"He has something to fear," said Tusk's address to the brother of the dead president, Prime Minister of the Government Party Law and Justice of PiS Jaroslaw Kaczyński.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me," said Tusk and read to the current leadership of the country that he is trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
On leaving the D.A.'s headquarters, he was waiting for Tuska, according to TVN 24 crowd, which rant Donald Tusk! and wished the politician 100 years!.
Tusk thanked for his support and made sure he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me."
According to the prosecutors, he does not blame anything, but he does not doubt that justice is to serve as an instrument against opponents, oppositions or people who do not like it, and I fear I belong to this group.
He's been in interrogation for the second time.
The Expremier was questioned at the prosecution for the second time, this time he was to deal with mistakes in the autopsyes of victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, it came to replace the bodies in the coffins.
The families were forbidden to open coffins, and there had to be some reason for that.
And the reason they were afraid of the scandal was because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"The maintenance of good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should serve to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," said Kaczyński on Catholic TV Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would undermine Tusk's chances of getting the most important chair in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also stated that he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk might end up in different ways, but she didn't notice.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour hearing at the Public Prosecutor's Office on 19 April.
Even then, he didn't speak as a suspect, just as a witness.
However, many of his calls for questioning considered as part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczynski to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by combining with various scandals.
In Poland, the prosecution is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who serves as the Attorney General.
Soon after the election of Tusk, the call for questioning came to the head of the European Council, whom Kaczyński worked hard to prevent, but in vain, among other things, when visiting Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk's mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested alone.
In this case, even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw on his heels.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote on the composition of the House of Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It comes from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots to a foreign country.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update, currently in the proceeding.
Four years ago, 10 thousand Czech citizens voted abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the Decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the Ministry justifies its procedure.
"In some countries, new representative offices were created, some offices were closed, or the level of representation was changed," says the paper.
The decree shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall include the representative offices to which the paper ballots are supplied.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a vote card in the version for printing.
Their list is changing with the decree.
Four years ago, the Czechs could vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassys are closed today.
The Czech Republic also cancelled its representation in the Malaysian Bamaku and Japanese Kyoto.
He won't even vote for the consulate general in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in the east of Ukraine.
They are now on the list of the embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, the capital of Dakar and the Zambian Lusace.
Since the last parliamentary elections in Asia, the Czech Republic has extended its representation to the Consulate General in Iraq, Irbíl and Cheng-tu, the capital of the Chinese province of S'-chuan.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs in abroad have had the opportunity to select Members in the electoral rooms at the representative offices or consulates four times.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall decide on the fate of the country for which the candidates are voting abroad.
It was the first time in 2002 when it was decided between South Moravian candidates.
During the following two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere of 15 years ago, some 3800 people came to vote, around 6700 in 2006, four years later 8222.
An early parliamentary election was held four years ago at the embassy of 10.571 voters.
Massacre on Moore's Ford: activists recalled racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed past the sighting residents of Monroe, Georgie, and codercaled towards Moore's Ford.
But before a car with four passengers black skin and a white driver had enough to reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns covered the way for him.
The group leader - middle-aged man in a striped suit - long pulled out of the cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, passengers trembled with fear.
"We want this n--and Roger!" the man shouted.
"Bring it to me!"
Quietly interrupts the scream of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of the events that took place on 22 July.
But when one of the men throws the noose over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists returned to the Moore's Ford bridge to reconstruct the fateal night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were killed by members of Kukluxklan.
No one's ever been tried for murder before.
"It is a wonder that in all these years only one person has not been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the reconstruction of the event.
"It is a stain on our history and the burden in our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Georgia Congressman and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to take place. Each year, to the community of the city of Monroe, he reminds us that justice has not been done for enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
"Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin."
The medical examiner covers one of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI files acquired by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts were to participate in lynching.
However, no one has been prosecuted so far.
Despite the fact that suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights supporters claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - have been known to all the inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the ruling of the Supreme Court, the citizens of Georgia’s black skin won for the first time the right to participate in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer elections that the FBI said that the farmer of Roger Malcom's black skin was supposed to stab the owner of Barnett Hester's white skin during the struggle because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester and Malcom's wife, Dorothy, used to hang out with him and bring her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then important owner of Loy Harrison's white-skinned property made bail of $600 for Malcoma.
Dorothy and his cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
On returning from prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects covered their way.
"As it turns out, he planned and organized the murders," the FBI said.
"It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between state and local ombudsmen, who not only participated in lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses."
Brooks has made a more brief statement on the matter.
"It was a massacre because of electoral law," he said.
"The murders had a clear subtext for all the local black skin residents: 'This is how you get caught if you register and go to vote'."
The annual event reconstruction at Moore's Ford is organized for almost ten years by Cassandra Greene.
Its performance is symbolic, enticing and accurate, showing deep-rooted racism, which many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
It's not easy to watch this reconstruction, and it's even harder to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"No one wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face unpleasant feelings that hide in each of us," Greene said.
"But we can't have a relationship if you don't listen to what I had to go through."
The main tests of this year's reconstruction began in June and on the first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest of blacks - took place in a room where Greene introduced them with a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as Assistant Director.
He played Kukluxklan for many years, but according to his words, the role is exhausting.
"I have a bad feeling about it because it contradicts who I am," said Marbaugh.
"I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to return to such a time."
The actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play the role of Roger Malcom, and therefore Barnett Hester, are practicing their roles.
The performance begins with a fight - Malcom argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
"Get off my property n--e!"
Rascona can't.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every actor of black skin) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughs most of all.
"What happened?" asks Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," says Greene cheerfully.
"I just don't think the whites used to say "n-r" like that."
"Exactly," one of the black-skin actors says.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is now better; hostility replaces a sense of convergence.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be made behind the four victims of the massacre.
The actors are repeating the scene.
This time Rascona puts emphasis on the correct expression of the word on N.
No one's laughing anymore.
The performance ends violently and quickly.
Shouting, gunshots... and then silence.
A woman dressed in black standing over the bodies of actors and battling Billie Holiday's "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there's sadness in the room.
Against the background of all of this, about a dozen eyesighters wipe their sweats and tears out of their eyes.
In the audience there are virtually the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple traveled all the way from New York's Ithaca, many of them from nearby.
Each one of them carries the local wet climate for almost eight hours and Brooks leads them in the crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, murder may have been viewed at a distance, but now, standing in the same place as lynching, the atmosphere is scary.
With the last words of the songs, Greene will call on a crowd looking at body inspection.
The kids kneel to the victim's heads, watch fake blood, and move bodies, whispering something in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy is torn away.
It'll be a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
Actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, a man in a suit who played the leader of Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two actor friends and weeps in their arms; in the end, emotions are upon him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know you're in denial of the role.
But you had a reason."
Later that day, the audience and the actors are meeting for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is interested in talking about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words that would express her feelings for today's performance.
“It’s hard to listen to the ugly words and to look at the disgusting things that people like you do, and they do it because they look like you,” she said for reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still an up-to-date topic," she added, "just called police fights."
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom and enjoys dinner and talks about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already begun to plan the performance for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear that we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about," he said.
“If we don’t learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it."
I love instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that only a coward reads instructions for use.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember a long time ago, where instructions for using anything was rather a rare phenomenon.
So, for example, my first turntable contained only one paper on which the hieroglyphs depicting the involvement of some parts, all of which had some secret markings.
After years, when something went wrong inside me, I offered the bill to the shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
He gave me advice on what the paper with the labyrinth of the line is suitable for.
Yes, it was a customary tool for chronic toilet paper depletion.
He found the wire and allowed me to listen again to expensive vinyl cookies.
New times brought new instructions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where simply stuck to a de-cut grep, required about ten images.
Particularly successful was a sketch with a description of how to insert one piece into another.
The set was two-part, and another procedure just wasn't possible.
Putting it in the opposite direction required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended at my Seat Leon self-propelled brand.
The year of production 2003 had such a book with instructions for minor repairs, including, among other things, the change of the light bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual neglected to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only three steps.
One, take the cover off.
2. Screw up the broken light bulb and screw up the new one.
3. Remove the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem with the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the car's trunk, I would jam some spring, screws, which would easily push the cover and then I would follow points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
It's a gurney fault.
The cover had no space, no space for the thin hand of Cinderella, let alone obese Sleman.
I've lost half an hour of my life without any success.
The condition was also strengthened by the entrance of my wife to the garage, which was called by a roar and words that my mouth hears quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked indelibly.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I skip the vulgar terms, there were only two publishing words left.
I'm changing my light bulb.
"And why is it taking you so long?" she risked a sentence that could be her last in a long-lasting union.
I slowly explained the problem to her, putting the main emphasis on the torture of the author of the instruction, where blessing with the hot iron on the hand that the manual wrote, then comforting her so that she could never write anything again, was a mere introduction to a wide range of instructions of the Witch's Block, including his commissional burning on the top of the Losin Castle.
"How about we unassemble the box?" said the woman who put the battery down.
In clear despair this happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as on the right side.
I thought I couldn't be surprised.
And that's until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just discussing his collapse after the checkup of two officials at the State Medical Control Department.
I know him as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced both the possible and the impossible in the field, and who can also interpret wild stories with an unexcited voice.
"I want you to imagine that I have received a fine for not having my hand-washing instructions put out," he told me with a weak voice.
I gradually overcome the whole problem of washing my hands over the sink in the patient's toilet.
His argument to the commission official that adults were generally able to wash their hands, and that no pictograms needed to handle the usual activity of decent people, had no healing effect and cost him considerable money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of washed hands flowing with water is a primitive action at the level of the crone that a modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, is carrying out this ceremony in ten steps.
So it must be said that water must be released from the tap.
The whole process has 11 points in total, but at the end is a joyous finding that you washed your hands exactly as ordered by the hosudar of the SÚKL.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired to prepare a detailed plan for the toilet activity.
On the issue of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will be no problem, in urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to post instructions two.
The problem remains the pictograms, because creating a perfect procedure also means a precise outline of all the anatomical details, which could wake up some indignation to a prudish visitor in the toilet, resisting finally knowing that he was wiping the opening with a completely wrong procedure throughout his life.
Pearson will fire another 3000 employees and reduce dividends in an effort to revive trade
The British educational group Pearson stated on Friday that they would fire more than 3000 employees and reduce the provisional dividend by 72% in response to the next restructuring programme in order to change the business model.
Another wave of redundancies, which, according to Executive Director John Fallon at the end of 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, follows the previous decision by the company to fire 4000 employees under the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a cost reduction plan of another £300 million ($394 million) in May under the third programme to reduce costs in order to resurrect falling trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company that agreed to sell its share in the Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month stated that the outlook for this year remained unchanged after it announced a 1% increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
An attack on the convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers were killed in a suicide explosion
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan Kabul. One NATO soldier died in the attack and several others were injured, reported official representatives.
Five soldiers and interpreter were injured, says NATO.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians also died in an attack in Qarabagh County.
This month Afghanistan hit a bomb attack - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in the Herat Mosque.
On Monday, a suicide attacker killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO stated in its statement that a Tuesday explosion took place after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by “a local person with a home made explosive device”.
The statement also states that all wounded soldiers are out of danger of life and are in an American military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to the rapporteurs, the growing power of the Taliban and the groups known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is an important source of concern for NATO's Allied Forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, at least 1662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul killed a bomb.
Taliban has applied for the attack.
On May 31st, he killed a great explosion in the city centre of more than 150 people, the most deadly military attack in the country since the U.S. troops destroyed the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence undermines the already questionable situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of American soldiers who should help military troops and policemen in the country.
According to the rapporteurs, suicide attacks have shaken, which have been trained in recent weeks by public confidence in the government, its regulation, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanín.
EPA re-evaluated its decision to postpone smoking rules in response to the complaint
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has withdrawn its decision to postpone the Obama Administration Act, which ordered the States to reduce their emissions only one day after the Agency was sued by 15 States.
In Wednesday night, EPA announced its decision on the delegation of "Ozone Standards 2015" with the words that it presents the Agency's commitment to cooperate with the States.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and listen to their views," said the director of EPA Scott Pruitt.
Pruitt announced in June that EPA efforts to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and determine the limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 of the most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, substantiating that EPA negotiations are illegal.
President Trump's administration seeks to prevent the many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - according to Trump's words in an attempt to boost economic growth.
However, the new government's efforts have launched countermeasures by democrats and conservative groups that fear the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA states on its website that breathing air with ozone content “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnar got hit and blood flowed!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event at Czech conditions, where he hosted such leading personalities as Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was not moderated by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show itself to the public and to introduce his music video to the song of Sara, whose baptism was attended by just named personalities.
However, few people already know that the video recording itself, which took place in Russia, was not easy and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it was not without a proper mess.
Sara's song is very emotional and based on the unfortunate love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, in the video, the singer's juice was supposed to indicate a blow in the face.
At one point, however, he was struck so hard and right in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a wound, I didn't expect it, immediately the blood came out of my nose," Ladislav commented.
Colleagues and producers said it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not serious enough to affect the continuation of the next shooting.
We are bringing you the video of a young artist, and you can also record the scene with a blow.
A bad version of blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time on a Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was located in a separate room in ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia - the undefeated champion in a lightweight World Boxing Council - did not come down to the hall where he welcomed Lomachenka, the champion in the cock vase World Boxing Organization.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in the Saturday Showtime game, both boxers made the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said: “How’s it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenka Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a "perfect test".
“I am a former champion in a cockweight,” Garcia adds.
“I had to gain weight for the Broner game (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
On my 63 kg, I'm small.
I'd like to go back to the light weight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight again in order to gain light weight... then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Why don't you do it."
Lomachenko agrees.
"The box would be good for this game."
Klimas made a request to pay for a visit - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should take his debut in a light weight at the end of this year and next year to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the duel winner Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete for the title in a lightweight in the Forum arena on 23 September.
"The fight should be done in the style of viewing payments, which is what fans are asking for," said Garcia, who later said that it is open to broadcast the game through a television station that will come up with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw that much attention to themselves.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said that he recognized Lomachenka as "an amazing boxer" and that he could participate in his Saturday game.
But Lomachenko did not let Garcia be praised when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow... sorry, Mike, but you're asking for a knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers said they felt a rising tension before each other's duel.
"You can't just forget this game.
No other game gets that much attention.
And I'm happy to put it in the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey."
It's gonna be a great game."
A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
They just found their car at the bottom of Volga.
Two young Russians Ilja Žirnov and Kira Čerkasova have been missing since December 2005.
Extensive search for them began, but without success.
And the police ended the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they wouldn't know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years came the sad ending of the whole story.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volha river in Čebokary, Čuvask.
Only with the documents left in the car were the police able to identify a few.
The documents survived the entire decade underwater, without which the police would have taken much longer to find out the identity of the found.
A couple were last seen when Zirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
So far, the diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboxar police, who pulled the car out to the beach the next day.
The investigators believe that the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road around the river.
However, the investigation continues, further details will be published after its completion.
Latest test results to determine the age limit for applications for asylum in Sweden
The latest results of tests by asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people were asked as older than 18 years, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish forensic medical agency (RÃ¡ttsmedicinalverket) began carrying out new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants more accurately in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measures were taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failure to determine the right age of some refugees who lied about their age.
As of today, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted a total of 2481 tests to investigate 6880 cases, and the forensic medical agency has now published the results of the 2481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as over 18 years of age, while in the next 25 cases, the forensic medical agency considered that the question was ‘probably over 18’.
In the next 423 cases, it was decided that the questionant was “probably under 18 years of age”.
The tests shall be taken only if the age of the contested is disputed.
According to Johan Gô¶ransson, forensic medical agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
"In contrast to last month, the statistics are kept in the track and the numbers are very similar," he said for The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 do not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and stated that in 442 cases it was found that ‘the person concerned was 18 years or older’.
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the questioned party stated that he would be 18 years old this year.
Critics were also followed by a medical method of age determination, which includes X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are then assessed by dentists and X-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is involved, among other things, in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the concerned passed through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I do not think that these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we cannot determine age with accuracy, we should not pretend otherwise," said Metro.
The forensic medical agency of the Agency's Gô¶ransson advocated the decision by saying: “In general, the risk of misjudgement of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person in question is just below the age of 18 years, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all persons in question."
Trump threatened President Mexico on the phone.
US President Donald Trump, on a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, threatened not to meet him if he publicly says that his country will not pay for the construction of a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump, in an interview, said that funding would be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Similarly, Trump spoke openly to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
It's based on the transcripts of the interviews that The Washington Post published on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
Right in his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after he became Trump Peña Nieta, he undiplomatically reproved for building his plan to build a wall.
He described the Southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," said Trump repeatedly in his interview of 27 January and threatened to break contact with the Mexican president if he continues to make repulsive statements.
I hear the funding's gonna come up with a plan and eventually it's gonna be okay.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to see you gentlemen anymore, because that's unacceptable to me," said Trump, U.S. daily.
The wall has called the least important thing we're talking about, but politically it's probably the most important thing.
The executive order for the construction of the Trump wall was issued shortly after the takeover of power.
Mexico is rejecting the construction and financing of a wall of 3200 kilometres long, which is why the relations of both countries have escalated.
At the end of March, Trump said that the project would still be valid for the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also informed Trump about a call with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28th.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
To that end, he was forced to exchange views on the agreement that Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internation facilities in the Pacific islands.
First Trump thought the deal was stupid, but later he approached it.
"You can definitely say that this is not the deal you made, but you will have to stick to it," said Trump Turnbull.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost inconclusive, for example, when Trump appreciated the good idea of Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump was joking.
But suddenly the tone of the conversation became sharp.
"I hate accepting these people," said Trump.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They will not be great people who will go to work for local dairy workers," he said.
In an interview, he also noted that a fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years' time.
Trump ran phone calls with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after coming to the White House, often during one day.
The call to Turnbull ended up calling him the least enjoyable in a day.
Before he finished it, he pointed out that he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer before the crowd.
Her father also watched.
The execution took place on the square in the capital of Yemen Saná.
Muhammad al-Magrabi chose Rana Almatari as his victim, who lived in his neighborhood.
Al Magrabi kidnapped a girl, took her to his father's house where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
Then he raped her body, and then dumped it near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl hit the whole country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row a thousand - head crowd that gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was sentenced under the law of Sharia.
The victim's father shared his feelings with the media after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
The other members of the family were present, and together with the crowd they shouted the slogan "let justice live."
A rapist in the square brought a police van from which he was pulled out.
Cops put him in the stomach.
One of the members turned his weapon against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The present crowd celebrated every blow that was fired.
Mr. al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Alah and Sharia's right prevailed," he added.
I was standing at the Sana Liberation Square waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were worried that a crowd gathered in the square would fall into hatred, grab and lynze the killer.
The execution was ordered by a court under the authority of the Shiite Hoots.
But originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 blows by a whip right after the arrest, but his act was so indignant that the judge decided to take the death penalty.
Al Magrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on 27 June.
Rana's family knew him well.
When the police searched his house's basement, they discovered evidence that a man planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the morning.
"Our family doesn't have enemies, and the injury that carried Ran's body was terrible," he said to the media.
"The morning went missing, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her picture hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible act.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, must have been hospitalized after she found out her daughter's body was found.
Rana used to play out with other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked by our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was held and to demand immediate punishment.
The D.O.J.'s representative has read a record of the investigation to the crowd here to calm them down.
Apparently, the accused showed no regret over his actions.
Right before his sentence, the police read him the verdict, but the convicted only looked at his executioner for a few years.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many recordings were made on the Internet by the crowd.
Governor of West Virginia announced a change in the political party
The Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced at President Trump's assembly on Thursday night that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats turned their back on me," said the Governor of Justice.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I declare to you... today as a resident of West Virginia, I say that I cannot support you any more from the position of democratic governor."
The crowd of viewers exploded with joy.
"I'm going to join the Republicans tomorrow," he added.
"As a coach, I can tell you that it's time to start another game."
Trump had already promised people an important announcement at a meeting in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, which, according to Forbes magazine, is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owned several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday night, the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying: "The running over of the Governor of Justice is another blow to the democratic party that is putting obstacles in our way instead of raising our country."
“For a democratic party with only 15 governors and control the least legislative authorities in history, the announcement of the Governor of Justice is the last drop for an already impoverished party without a leader who is in vain seeking to find a positive and unifying report,” said RNC President Ronna McDaniel in her statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "fair" apology for a doping scandal
The former excellent athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia for her sincere apology for the doping scandal on Thursday, but he repeated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sporting world.
Dmitry Shylakhtin, the head of Russian athletics, said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which took place on the eve of the MS in athletics - that the removal of his country from the world of sport was right and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way. ”
Despite his comments, the members of the IAAF voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which entered into force in November 2015, after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report revealed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think we have seen very sincere answers and presentations today," said President Sebastian Coe.
"All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its error and worked hard to correct and restore the proper function of the entire Federation."
Coe said that he was also "pleasant" that Russia had adopted criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has done a great job and we have advanced to the next stage, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis crew to maintain the punishment that has been dropped on Russia,” added Coe.
"In the coming months, we must do everything we can to stabilise the situation.
Our effort has always been to separate the honest athletes from the dishonest ones," he ended his speech.
At MS in athletics, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under neutral flag, who have fulfilled strict IAAF rules.
The head of the IAF Rune Andersen crisis crew on Monday said that Russia still had to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
The drug tests are still unsatisfactory and the exclusion trainers continue their activities, told the reporters in London after the presentation of the IAAF Board.
The Czech Trade award was awarded by the company František Savov, which the state is pursuing.
The public contract was awarded by the publishing house Mladá fronta František Savov.
Officials awarded him 100 percent of the points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state is prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and asking for its release to the Czech Republic.
In April, the Ministry of Industry and Trade pro-export agency has issued a public contract for four years of content management for the BusinessInfo portal.
A total contract of CZK 30.8 million was awarded by the publishing house Mladá Front of the entrepreneur František Savov.
In 2014 the Czech police accused him of tax evasion and prosecuted him on the run.
Savov has fled to Great Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his release.
The case was notified by the server Aktuálnej.cz.
According to the original Czechtrade criteria, 60 percent of the price offered and of the remaining 40 beauty contests, i.e. the quality of the project, were to decide on the award.
The second criterion helped Savov’s company significantly.
According to Dotyk.cz, she received 100 points in all sub-crisis quality criteria.
As a result, it was moved before another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated with the amount of 404 900 crowns per month, VLM offered 324 350 crowns.
In contrast to the Young Front, however, 62 points were obtained from the evaluators in all qualitative criteria under-average evaluation.
Tendru was also attended by BDO Advisory consulting firm and the digital agency R-Media, which belongs as well as the server Aktuálne.cz under the publishing house Economia.
VLM submitted several objections to the outcome of the tender, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
Following their rejection, it decided to challenge competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the Czech Republic.
He believes that the Czechtrade acted against the law.
"The applicant believes that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the supplier of the contract on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," writes in the proposal to initiate the procedure submitted to the UOHS this week, which published the server Updateally.
According to the Director-General and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the VLM Michal Klíma, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be untrustworthy and 100% evaluation of the Mladá Front project for all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors to be improbable and suspicious," Klímo said.
The Czechtrade situation has not yet been addressed.
The Czechtrade agency does not comment on public contracts before they are closed.
All information about you mentioned contract is in accordance with the law published in the Contracting Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the completion of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract we cannot comment on it," said the media representative of the agency Štěpán Dlouhý.
The young front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that the publisher of Economia interfered with an article in Aktuálna.cz in a competition where he had his own business interests.
However, this fact has been stated in that Article.
In the tender, she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo Editorial Service portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Kuba ODS.
Františka Savova is blaming the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive deductions of VAT from his companies, which caused the Czech state an alleged damage of up to CZK 770 million.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, is behind his criminalization.
Last year, the London court rejected the appeal against the issue, but the entrepreneur appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not gone anywhere since last year, from Great Britain we have not yet received any notice in the case of acquiring legal power," said Štěpánka Zenklová, spokesperson for Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov was located in Harvestor Limited, located in Cyprus, which controlled the Czech-Swedish Brewery Samson, and the Cypriot company Maraflex, which is profiled as an investment fund, buying threatened assets.
He should also control a failed Heavy Machinery Services company, formerly Legios, who owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was associated with the removal of assets from the former Socialist Union of Youth.
The biker ran through the sidewalks and the park, ended up in the boilers.
The biker caught attention on the streets, pavements and park paths in Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to run off in the direction of the station.
"The men's politicians were very careful to chase the city, when, on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně, he failed to drive, and he entered the field where he crashed with the motorcycle," said police spokesperson Daniel Dvořák.
The accident was eventually accompanied by a rescue helicopter who transported the injured biker to the Pilsen hospital.
Then the police found that the motorcyclist did not own a driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were stolen, his production number cut and the production label itself removed.
It's so possible the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"The breath test carried out at the point of presence of alcohol in the driver was excluded, but a positive result was found on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesperson said.
How the financial rules affect Neymar's transfer to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs will not undermine Neymar's record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious League of Champions.
The rules on fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 provide that the PSG will have to demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was not financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million in conversion just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of million dollars a year.
Followed by several financial conditions of Neymar's transfer to France.
As the PSG team is funded by a rich Qatar family, which has become rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into the already starring football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on buying players, but on the other hand they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overhead costs of their business activities related to football.
The FFP introduced Michel Platini following the appointment of Director of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that are in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected their attention from club debts to monitor their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and to spend a horrific sum on the player y to build a global brand - suddenly it was not so convenient.
For the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs may report a loss of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Cheferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
"The FFP rules still apply and we are determined to strengthen them in the future," said Associated Press Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules last week.
Although the PSG paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, it may, for the purposes of accounting, spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be signed at EUR 44,4 million each year for a five-year period.
In 2014, the first wave of FFP sanctions hit the PSG along with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
The PSG paid a fine of EUR 60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and a command to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is paying attention to teams that can attempt to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their income through companies associated with club owners.
Therefore, even if the Qatar company sponsors PSG, once the financing exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the billing of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority of the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, some reports of Neymar's PSG revenues could be paid from the MS's organisation committee in football 2022 in Qatar.
However, the PSG and the representatives of MS 2022 in Qatar denied that Neymat should become the ambassador of MS in football and that such a maneuver would be easily exposed by UEFY officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to Tuesday's voice, UEFA has not initiated any investigation into Neymar's transfer to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as it was not justified to comment on the PSG situation, said The Associated Press.
The latest published financial statements show that the PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymara's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and the sales of sweatpants.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Representatives of the Spanish League, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to destroy Neymar's departure, arguing that the PSG would violate the FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' of both the club and the state," said President La Liga Javier Teba for Spanish newspapers AS, referring to the ownership of the PSG club by the Qatari Syndicate.
The manager of Arsenalu Arsene Wenger, whose club owns the American sports magnate, shares the same position of La League on the financing of the club.
“This is the result of ownership, which has changed the football world from scratch in the last 15 years,” Wenger heard on Thursday.
“As soon as the club owner becomes the owner, anything is possible.
Observing the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan subsidist Rosical: The changes are painful, but we must believe.
Sixteen thousand apluding fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rosický is going to the square.
Same scene as the Sunday game against the Bohemians.
Spartan reserver was moving against Crvena Zvezda's game, he invented several globals, but his teammates did not head for the black.
The Leten team pumped with new multi-million-dollar reinforcements so that after the initial double match in European cups ends.
Was it hard to do anything else after Belgrade?
After the scored goal, it took four shots, which was hard for us.
At least we wanted not to lose, to raise our self-esteem, so we had something to bounce into the next game.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game.
Why couldn't Sparta get into the game so long?
The game is so busy.
The competition combination was much better than ours.
We didn't make it. We fired in the middle of the day.
Of course, that's very little if you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we were able to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into positions like this more often.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it's one of the pains of creating a new team.
We've only played three competitions, and the lineup is still changing.
It's about getting the coach to find the perfect 11 to sit down.
Is it encouraging that you've already played part of two games in a row?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how I'm going to develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have happened in Sparta?
We have to be, or there's no other way.
It's the same as getting hurt.
If you don't believe me, you can't go back.
Sparta has decided somehow, we have to be optimistic, or the situation will get worse.
The fans again came in large numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
There was an amazing visit again, just like with Goddammit.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show them something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember this kind of visit when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting ourselves, we're playing, so it's not an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the businessman is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of entrepreneur Jiří Toman, who is to be held in prison for a substantial amount of tax cuts.
The calculated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in the complaint that justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc were said to be incomplete.
The Constitutional Judges, however, called the complaint unfounded, found the CTC from the Court's database.
The US is not another appeal court.
"It cannot consider, as a fourth instance, the factual or legal errors alleged to have been committed by the General Court if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as escaped.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of the decision-making of the UN.
The fine imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage suffered.
The Supreme Court has identified the case as an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis between 2005 and 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million was created only during the period January to July 2008, the total escape according to the expert exceeded the billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the entire amount.
According to the prosecution, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties, at least tens of millions of CZK were taxed in mere statisticians.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company has been trading are related to the entrepreneur Radomír Vybír, whom it has set up for VAT machinations in the fuel business for 13 years in prison.
He also rejected his complaint before the Constitutional Court.
The series "The Summer of Survival" and "Comrade Detective" play a nostalgic string
This story is nostalgic for both the figures of the famous 1980s; and for the dirty 1990s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced on MTV a comedy sketch "The State"); and of course for a modern time, namely, the year 2001, before the stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd broke into larger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern facebook era of lasting memories.
Well, it looks like someone's out of breath.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (for example, the story of the creation of a talking can with vegetables, which was made by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors turned away from the main funny point - middle-aged actors who played teen horny children - and could not make fun of previous events.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later", in which adults play, does not push so much on the emotional plane and satire is the places to sporadic, including the parody of the 90s thrillers as the "Hand on the Wheel".
At one point, the character will find Apple Powerbook, roller skates and “a lot of other things from 1991”.
Many main story lines are repeated.
Goodhearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, has still not moved over his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter), promoted by George H. W. Bush (very well occupied by Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of the france.
It's especially fun to watch young Rudd with long hair, alias the character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose former respectable character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
They could launch the moments of random madness, such as the "Seven Up" series, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical idea: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when the group will be released at the premiere of "Léta do not survive".
In the meantime, "Comrade Detective" at Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgic: the revivalism of the Cold War of the series "Such ordinary Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regrets" and even the "GLOW" series, which meets the icon of the Eastern and Western wrestling scene.
The comedy of the creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fight for the truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, which have been added to the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as policemen watching chess on TV - parody for American football).
The series was given a voice by many famous actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" is too focused on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes the killer with Reagan's mask - and so it looks.
Six long episodes are far too distracting and comedian moments are not enough.
With shorter footage, propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, where two fat people eat burgers placed on a large pile.
The clear message to the imaginary Communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgy.
The inventions of the Romanian creators were right: we do so with our own culture, just as with theirs.
The Russian athletes have not seen the cancellation of the ban on starting from the IAAF.
The International Athletic Federation of the IAAF at the London Congress confirmed the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian competitors due to the state-supported doping program.
The vote on the scene of the World Championship, which will begin on Friday, was very clear as expected.
166 delegates voted for the extension of the ban, and there were only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the implementation of the anti-doping system, as stated before the Congress by the chief of the special investigation group IAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unsolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been questioned and trainers still work in the country with a broken reputation.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is still fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian athletic federation was suspended in November 2015, so the Russian athletes lost, among other things, last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the prohibition of the upcoming MS, 19 Russians will participate, who have previously demonstrated that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.

The Bank of England should, as expected, announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a slight economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has suffocated speculation on sharp growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain "in the background" in relation to the maintenance of the interest rate - despite the waning of family budgets.
Political officials of the Committee on Monetary Policy (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two in favour of maintaining the interest rate of 0.25%. The results of the vote in favour of an increase in interest rates supported the insignificant economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its Annual Inflation Report, the Bank predicted an increase of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the reduction of family budgets would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that there should be growth over the next few years as a result of the inflation caused by Brexit and also stated that the rents from real estate should increase more in the financial markets than expected.
Members of the Committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago as a response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Plan for forward financing should start to apply from next February, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England said that it will now offer £15 billion less compared to the planned £15 billion.
Just before the decision, the Bank stated: ‘The MPC predicts that the gross domestic product (GDP) will, in the short term, stagnantly stagnate, along with the pressure on real household income and the burden of consumption.’
On the subject of tariffs, the Bank stated that it would be necessary to "stretch monetary policy belts" in order to calm inflation, "to a greater extent" than the markets expected.
The markets currently predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "limited".
The Bank reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The expected growth in 2018 of 1,8 % remained unchanged.
Following the publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing increase buried the hope of further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0,3 % in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank’s comments.
The latest report on inflation is a slight comfort for households affected by rising inflation and poor wage increases.
The report also states that monetary policy cannot "prevent" a reduction in revenue in the coming years, but wages are expected to "significantly" rise to the end of the three-year forecast.
Economics should also increase due to the great interest in British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will compensate for a lower percentage of consumer expenditure.
This decision came a year after the rate was reduced to 0,025% in August last year in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, resulting in a fall in pounds.
The Bank estimates that it will take at least four years to fully unify prices and the economy.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates, along with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on households, and three political factors demanded an increase of 0.5 % in June.
Inflation has fallen back to 2.6% of June 2.9% last month, despite the fact that the bank stated that it had expected such a change and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess was relative to 2 % of the target was ‘total’ as a result of a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “As swap rates fall recently, competition in the mortgage market seems to only rise once creditors start competing for contracts with a view to a good view at the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end existing contracts and new mortgages - in the offer there are options free of charge, as well as the low rates they get at popular level."
NHS will prescribe a controversial HIV medicine to 10,000 patients
Patients will receive access to “transformative” treatment for HIV prevention from September following a decision of the Supreme Court on the financing of NHS.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-expoure propylaxis (PreEP) pill, which is used before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86%, will be offered through the health service to around 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appeal court supported the decision of the Supreme Court last year, stating that the NHS had financial resources to pay for the PrEP despite the statement that the cure should be financed by the local authorities.
The decision announced on Thursday was taken by the NHS of England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “deciding moment”.
The clinics of sexual health in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Other clinics will join in October and a full implementation will take place throughout England by April 2018.
Pre-expoure prophylaxis (PreEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PreEP significantly reduces the risk of transmission of HIV between patients at risk.
The PreEP application before sex means that there are enough specific medicines in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transsexual people and people with HIV positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics shall designate eligible participants who sign consent to participation in the testing, including men, women, transsexual people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will be issued by taxpayers at £10 million and NHS England has signed a contract this week to distribute medicines after obtaining an international public contract.
The trial period is proposed for the collection of clinical evidence and the assessment of the full potential of the PREP, its purpose, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and fully exploit the ever-growing and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It's another milestone in over 30 years of trying to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, NAT Executive Director (National Aids Trust) said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PreEP is administered correctly and at risk to patients, it will offer the possibility of changing the HIV epidemic of England.
NSH will offer from September patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful instrument, which is individually controlled and is not subject to the need to persuade their partner, leading to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We accept this declaration with pleasure.'
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘ Priority number one must be a quick test deployment across the country; we must ensure that it is accessible to every patient.
We now have a PreEP trial medicine at our disposal and we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of getting HIV.'
Minister of Health Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delay and delay by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this medicine can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transfer of this life-threatening infection.
The subsequent tests will bring us a step closer to full understanding of the benefits of the PrEP.
It is now important that we launch tests throughout the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to end the spread of HIV in society together."
Life on a high leg: interfloor and smart design have transformed this small apartment into Earls Court in a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former real estate banker, traded a large house in Knightsbridge in 2014 for an apartment at Earls Cour.
Located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace, it is an illustrative example of a modern design that uses the maximum available space.
"Before that, I lived with my ex-husband in a much bigger house in Knightsbridge," said Joanne.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same height of the ceiling.
I immediately fell in love with him, and I nodded him that same day."
Since then, the apartment of 1,000 square meters of complete refurbishment has been passed.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add a restroom and an interfloor to use a high ceiling.
“I longed for high ceilings, big windows and lots of light.
That's what my demands were," she said.
To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed's design and design studio based in Notting Hill and used a nearly four-foot ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height that two gaps would fall over each other - the challenge for architects was to create an inter-storey floor on which to walk uprightly.
Erfan must have involved his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but also bending the steel structure in such a way that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to construct two full rooms on himself - while adding to the dramatic.
In the interplanet looks at the beautiful living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for the storage of cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of a living room, which lends the impression of a much larger space to the whole apartment, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Tilt kitchens are nothing new.
But what is unique about this solution is a folding door.
"We had to solve the technical site," Erfan says about the reinforced gilded doors.
"The door is provided with counterweight to be very easy."
Thanks to its clever use of space and storage space, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes to it, what you're selling is a residential area - or a valuation of your property," Erfan said.
"The real estate broker essentially calculates its price on the basis of the residential area when entering the apartment."
In this case, we managed to increase the residential area while maintaining the quality materials that lend the space a luxury look.
"Material is very important because you are touching it and creating an emotional bond with home," Erfan added.
"You don't love the power distribution in the walls.
Yes, they're important, but your hearts won't win."
As it turns out, quality design and increase of living space can transform an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is expanding.
The cultural and political gap between blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on travelling to the State of Tennessee and seven other states.
The State of Tennessee paid her back and declared a retribution ban on travelling to California for its citizens.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense, and the citizens of the United States can travel freely in all 50 countries.
It is that California has prohibited the spending of state money on the journeys of its citizens to eight other states such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT, and any statement of disagreement with LGBT's lifestyle is considered discrimination.
However, Tennessee has adopted a law on the reservation of conscience, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients has no obligation to provide it to them, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have adopted laws that religious charities that have been given to children from mothers to birth for adoption do not have an obligation to provide such children with the same sex couples.
Because of these laws on the reservation of conscience, California banned the financing of its citizens' journeys to eight states of the Union from its resources.
In practice, this means that California’s professors must not have access to scientific symposia, for example, in Texas paid off by their universities because they are co-financed by the State of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants on the road, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund the travel of citizens from state A to state B or private sponsoring.
The State of Tennessee has become patient and its parliament has adopted a law with a resolution that it also does not like California's high tax policy, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still does not impose travel embargos on California because of that.
He's imposing them as a retribution for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any state of the Union that would order a similar travel ban to another state for whatever reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt law on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they must not do.
Secondly, what is wrong with the reservation of conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why not just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty when the butchers offering the pork are enough?
In the state of Colorado, a baker is facing an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine because he refused to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes with hundreds of bakers of others?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but the individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policy in non-federal capacity according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there are diversity, diversity, diversity.
California could be California, and Texas could be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states are also California!
Fourthly, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and let them live by which all reasonable people should live, but some activists strive not to tolerate each other and others, but for extreme intolerance to others.
According to them, no one must ever show moral, religious, or philosophical dissent with the LGBT lifestyle, and if he does, he should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I don't know the situation in American history, where states have done that for political issues, except for a single case.
Even during the civil rights struggle of blacks, where the North and West were on the side of integration and South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on themselves.
The only case was the 1950s, the political case was slavery and the war of the North against the South was over.
Of course, nothing like this is going to happen now, but the situation is toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the blue democratic states and the red Republican states is deepening and the US is mentally expanding.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic got a greasy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has received a fine of 300,000 rubles for violating the rules of the campaign before the presidential elections next year.
The court fined him for inviting people to attend unauthorized demonstrations.
In the last two months, Navalny has organized two large anti-government street protests and announced that he wants to apply for the post of head of state next March.
The Chief of the Kremlin Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He fined him for inviting people to demonstrate through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off a judge's salary later," the Kremlin's twitter joked.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential elections because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalnyy, who is considered to be a fighter against corruption, considers the relevant judgment politically motivated.
Penalties in the amount of 300 thousand rubles, hence 25 thousand rubles, were imposed by the court on Thursday also to two members of the Naval election team, Leonida Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend the Naval in their campaign.
In February he was sentenced to a five-year conditional sentence because he robbed the Kirovles forestry company.
In May, the verdict was confirmed by the appeal court.
The judgment is so powerful, which, according to Russian law, prevents the Naval from running.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the establishment of the empire of their Italian family, are pulling one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in the Toorak estate, only three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who had a dispute over common property and business property to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being disputed before the Supreme Court.
Along with his mother, Anna, his own brothers have a total of 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars. The first store bought a family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the Westco Jeans family founded a chain of 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The money bought additional properties and portfolio of the De Lutis family now includes offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments at Gold Coast and Mt Buller and business centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul's words, is a “significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds of the assets.
The court reports that Colin owns $316 million while Paul manages the property for $176 million.
For Paul, the division of assets and funds has become a problem.
“Colin’s proposal was very much in his favor in my eyes,” wrote Paul in his sworn statement to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first meeting of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paula, according to his statement, cut Colin off.
Colin opposes the fact that it's not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement with certain properties.
In his previous sworn statement, Colin stated that he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian origin dictates that my family is the most important thing," he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and both parties' attorneys.
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who held dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a mall in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought the property from Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “the last year of college, Paul was still a small, about a 10-year-old boy. ”
Anna De Lutis reported that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to the sons would take place in a good way.
"Luigi often said that he never wanted his sons to end up in court," she wrote.
Two more brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family's group of companies, and Colin stated that Mark had been compensated for $10 million in his retirement and Luke for $26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, “they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Since then, Colin has been holding back, despite the fact that he is a former member of the Board of Directors of the AFL, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend stated in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only Colin by means of a text message in which he stated that, given the fact that the dispute is being resolved before the court, "I have nothing to add to it".
“It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to deal with the whole matter before the court,” he wrote.
In one of Colin’s statements in mid-2016, he stated that he had tried to adapt to the requirements of his brother.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he said, adding that "he is still hoping for a successful solution".
On Friday, all hope was out of sight.
"Our disputes will be resolved in the near future," Colin wrote.
Hot in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
The MHD drivers fascinate both the water and the summer clothes.
At the school Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where about 35 children are now taking place, they only go out in the morning.
The school is under reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide a great shadow.
There's no pool, but the teachers shower in the nebula.
In the afternoon, the children remain in classes where the blinds and curtains are drawn.
The air is trying to cool off with an air cleaner because they do not have air conditioning.
It's also challenging for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the hygiene limits for maternity schools, so we should not actually have open operation during this period," said the headmaster of the kindergarten Miloslava Makovičková.
There's a glass corridor in kindergarten, where it says the temperature is about 40 degrees.
We blow up after 6:00 in the morning, the windows close, and we have the blinds we're protecting on the south side.
"But it won't help," she said.
Better conditions are in the forest kindergarten Na Hrazi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on our property, so we're underneath them.
"We have a beautiful peanut, there's a table below, and there's a lot of things we do," said the daycare director Barbora Kompan.
Teachers are trying to go to the woods with their kids, where there's more chill.
The children of wet hats and the program have different games with water.
"We have a manual pressure sprayer, which is used for flower sprays, and we use it to shower children," said Kompan.
Also the headmaster of the kindergarten in Novoborská Street, Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovská, said that teachers tried to keep the children in the shade and drip them with water.
"We have a fairly high garden, so they are under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child must have a headgear.
Teachers also remind children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or diluted juice, and they have waterpins in the garden.
They also have fresh fruit and vegetables to eat every day, sometimes brought to them by their parents.
"Even today, one mother brought about a ten-pound melon for the children," Makovicková said.
Drivers get water or summer uniforms.
The Prague DPP transport company provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms in hot days.
The cabs of the drivers by tram and bus are in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokesperson Aneta Řehková.
In addition to cabins, there are some trams in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not been seriously damaged yet.
There was minor damage in the loop in Hostivar.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that the drivers have sufficient drinks.
"Cold drinking water is available in all loops, alternate points and roads," said Řehková.
The so-called so-called so-dobars are available in the roads and in some alternate stations, which produce cooled sodium.
Drivers also receive soluble ion drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokesperson said.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increase in the number of fires.
On Tuesday, firemen throughout the Czech Republic liquidated 108, i.e. twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic were climbing over 35 degrees Fahrenheit, firemen employed mainly the fight against fire.
"The fires in the natural environment prevail, as well as those associated with the harvest work," said the spokesperson of the fire department, Nicole Zaoralová.
The firemen were relieved even by the evening weather change, when the heat replaced the storms and storms in many places.
In connection with the storms, the firemen went to 236 hits.
It was mainly about removing fallen trees and branches.
"Most of them have interfered in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
The help of firemen was also needed in Stvolenky, Czechoslovakia, where they evacuated 60 people from the children's camp for a storm.
Tropical temperatures have also contributed work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and at night on Wednesday, ambulances went to ten cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from punishment.
So people should have their water heaters checked, warn the paramedics.
Carbon dioxide is a colourless odourless gas that is released in imperfect combustion.
Signs of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and fainting sensation.
In case of suspected poisoning, leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media diet.
Many tried before him and always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new chief of staff at the White House is planning to limit President Trump's information flow - including news reports - in the hope that he will keep Trump on the surface.
Here's part of Josh Dawsey's report:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met on the first day in a new job with his staff, outlined the key problem of Trump’s White House, which he intends to correct: incorrect information that comes into the hands of the President.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all the information - whether on paper or on a spoken word - because the President could make a better decision on the basis of the correct information."
Kelly's diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke teeth in controlling Trump and his presentation in the media.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump was upset as a candidate with honest reports, it was convenient for him to show that he was spoken about in a positive light by a lot of other media, which was easier to convince," said Politico Sam Nunberg, a former campaign advisor in February.
Tara Palmeri from the Politico portal then wrote that "the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least according to the words of six former organizers of his campaign - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that praise him."
All right.
However, the idea that Trump’s tendency to publish his views on Twitter was ever “controlled” is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don't know about - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if someone didn't control them.
We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, then their efforts failed.
However, no one has ever been able to regularly prevent Trump from encouraging controversial issues.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by subsidizing the materials - which they can but may not be reliable - that support their view of the world.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the tendency of advisers to submit questionable information to the Head of State.
This is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher's pen:
“Trumpa’s current and former officials claim that the President often reacts very angryly to the negative news from the media, especially the leak reports, and seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone planted a copy of the GotNews.com article - the website of provocative Charles C. Johnson - who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the “source of many leaks of information” from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever banished from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already made false accusations public in the past and subsequently dismissed them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff of Reince Priebus and the secretary of the White House Rob Porter “led to implement the system for the administration and documentation of information that President Trump would receive”.
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to enforce the same strategy.
He may prove to be a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulses don't just disappear and his helpers are still competing for power.
These immutable factors of Kelly's mission will certainly make it more difficult.
Tourists negotiate for a ditch and return to the Millionaires' Quarter.
A few of the homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again taking over with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the right to regain the field for their residences.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field near a flourishing street in Solihull, called the “millionaire district”.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being declared in May. They did not fear even a moat that was excavated on the ground by the orders of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
A tact group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with unprotected caravans, which served as a way.
The angry residents of the neighborhood attacked the Solihull Board of Directors, saying that “they are unable to solve the problem”.
One of the residents who wished to remain anonymous said: “They occupied the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Management Board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to a different place, and now they're back.
There were others last night, and there'll probably be more tonight.'
She added: “The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I'm not going to continue paying taxes until the board of directors deals with tourists.'
Another anonymous citizen said: ‘ It’s ridiculous, and we’ve just been following the last tourists leaving, and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them and this time they brought horses with them.'
Solihull Board’s press agent said: ‘We are aware of an unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to resolve the problem successfully.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any non-social or unlawful behavior to the police at number 101.
We're going to get the total image we're going to present in court.'
The MEP's husband hit a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special took the wounded Róbert Zitňanský to Bratislava on Wednesday after noon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under the constant control of Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long scheduled flight went without complications.
According to information, Robert Zitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He's been hit by a car, and he's been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to the country, he was transported to a specialised workplace of one of the Bratislava hospitals.
An economic analyst is married to a Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská by NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.

Italians confirm in the fight against rescue ships of the NGO with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of rescue ships that arrive on the coast of Italy with immigrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO sign new rules governing their operations.
"If the NGO does not sign new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to continue their operations," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came the day after the Italian authorities confiscated the ship from the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet for suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization refused to comment on the whole matter because of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"For us, and always will be the priority of the number one rescue of human lives. So we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," said the organization in the statement on social networks.
"We can only comment on all the current charges after the gathering of all the information and the evaluation of the whole situation."
Italian authorities have been following the Iuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting immigrants, which were handed over directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place according to the applicant's file only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. Italian media published the meeting.
The ship's crew is suspected of violating the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area - humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the Code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last organisation appointed on Thursday stated that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable, as they represent no "substantial change or obstacle" in relation to rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was rejected, for example, by the organization of Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which holds the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Minni has heard that the sharp decline of immigrants in recent weeks who have landed in Italy in the framework of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and to cooperate with local mayors bear fruit.
"In the last days, we begin to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations this month with Mayor of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Unscrupulous Mesaros, silicone and cellulite came from the overal!
The hot summer days are totally enticing to wear just the most necessary to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesarosh does it the other way around.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers, and everyone who has anything to do with TV Prima, were just crawling, she wrapped her body in a mini overala.
And all it took was a few normal moves, and the model showed everyone their silicones, but also their buttocks.
It's because Overal cut her many times in between, plus he's been coughing up so high, she's still got to change it.
The attention of the masters and present photographers was certainly not in need.
Michelle Carter is convicted of sending text messages that encourage Conrad Roy's suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to a two-year sentence for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter is going to serve 15 months out of a two-year prison sentence and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was sentenced in June for unintentional killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was at risk of being taken away for up to 20 years, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter was standing in the place of a judgment with tears in her eyes, clenched hands and eyes facing the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the judge.
“She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She has shown no regrets."
However, attorney Carter said that these were "unfortunate circumstances which he deeply regrets".
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “their age or level of maturity or even mental disorder has no significant impact on their conduct”.
The plaintiff read Roy’s mother’s statement: “One day I will not grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the great pain that we will bear with us forever," said the statement.
Roy’s sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was “sponsored” by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother’s wedding and would never be an aunt to his children.
"The loss of the person I've been seeing since I was born is the pain I'll bear for life," she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a valid law to punish a person who helps to kill another person, so this case is based on a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014, poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter's text messages were published to incite suicide.
"I don't care if you hang yourself, jump out of the building or stab yourself," said Carter's text messages just two weeks before he died when Roy was on his family vacation.
A few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad," and "Just put the generator on, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz stated that Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any press comments.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who took the stand on Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Miss Knox (30) published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi adjusts up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just the day before the announcement of the Audi car manufacturer BMW stated that it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350 000 vehicles.
The BMW President said that the company believes that "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which is based on BMW - which are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
On Tuesday, Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel atumobils in Europe and the United States to comply with the carbon dioxide regulations.
The nitrogen oxide that releases diesel engines, however, is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time there is an increase in the cost of car installations to install equipment to neutralise the gas emitted by diesel engines, making it difficult for cars to compete.
While German car manufacturers are facing thorough inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
Companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen, which in an attempt to meet the emission limits installed in their cars software, which in testing reduced the amount of emissions issued, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior representatives of Volkswagen have been charged in the United States and others have been investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the Audi engine development department would be arrested in Germany.
The former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian nationalist and therefore does not apply to him extradition, so he can face a trial in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in a criminal investigation by the German police in the case of the Volkswagen car company after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent the European emission limits - thereby extending the accusations that Audi is facing in the US.
The inclusion of the Audi car company in the investigation may have an unfortunate impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane has landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
An accident occurred on the Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometres south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses to the TV channel of SIC Noticias said that the plane flew just above the people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50 - year - old man and an eight - year - old girl died on the beach according to local media.
"The plane hit them, and they were dead there," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of them got out alive, and the cops took them in for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
And are the motorways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It's incomplete, even though it started to build in 1978.
Even if it's not finished, it's being repaired constantly.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Yes, D11 Castle Highway.
Construction of the next section for at least a few months has newly stopped the Children of the Earth movement.
We East Bohemians get the freeway by bit, like when the salami are cut.
They'll cut the wheel, and then we'll see when and if we ever get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get the trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
The endless streams of truck ride straight through the town of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not a reasonable way to go around.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was launched in 2008, i.e. nine years ago.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section to Hradec Králové were recently built, and in other sections to Jaroměř, an archaeological survey began with the fact that the construction would begin at the end of this year, you could hear a loud banging of pins in the eastern Bohemia.
I mean, no one ever believed it.
Last week, it turns out it won't be built this year.
And maybe next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno reported decomposition.
The Earth's children are repeating their D1 tactics.
They attacked the decision on the building permit in its entirety.
They shall request in decomposition a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Castle Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, as well as the Ministry of Defence or the Dražní Office.
So far, we are leaving D11 near the village with the eloquent name Funeral.
So we're going down, we're just going down the highway, and all of a sudden we're standing on the side road, and we're going to take priority, and then we're going to go into the column.
The worst part is, you see stories like this all over the country.
Scary, constantly blocked road to Benešov, D1 motorway or D8.
Everyone has their funeral.
What do Children of Earth demand?
What is the nature of the problems of construction of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the motorway network virtually not complete in the current system?
Read the new reflex.
Provence Levandula threatens climate change
The lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the South-East region of France, but they are now at risk of climate change.
The lavender is deteriorating as a result of the dry climate and harmful insect, causing the dismay of researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “Levender cultivation in Provence has been under threat because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in spring and autumn.
It affects the life of lavender.
It is also the gypsies and grasshoppers that carry micro-bacterials that thrive in the dry climate."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and oil from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “The place of long and beautiful flowers grows smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants.
The quantity of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, smaller."
A possible solution can be more efficient water distribution and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also lavender spraying with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding of more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of journalists highlights growing threats in Mexico
Riodoc staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the riots in the Sinaloa area involving organized criminals, corrupt officials and non-stop drug wars.
But today, in recent times, the main reason why they meet is because of their own safety.
They learn that it is important that they change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was attacked by a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They will ask journalists to name each word - there is no need for any evidence, just use imagination and premonition.
Selecting them from what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from government or drug cartels - a catalogue of criminals whose task is to cover criminal acts.
Violence does not stop and the bodies are collapsing across the country; journalists are constantly increasing among them: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, there are at least 25 of them since President Enrique Pene Niet came into power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and in all seven countries seven have been killed this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the Riodioce periodical, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence linked to drug trafficking.
His loss is felt, although his presence is all-perceived - a large picture of Valdez with the inscription "Justice" on which the middle finger shows, hanging in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a shirt with a picture of Valdez with a smile on their face, glasses on their nose and a hat Panama.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor was established in 2010 in order to deal with the cases of journalists, two suspects were sued, as stated by the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that happen every year are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime, and the killers of journalists get to court very exceptionally.
Reporters from Riodoc insist on informing about the violence that is happening in Sinaloe; even though they are destroyed by grief and the territory is now very treacherous.
Without information about murderers and without any evidence of justice, the safety meeting is meaningless, says Ibarra.
"It is foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
In the morning of May 15 Valdez left the headquarters of Riodoc in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 missiles, apparently due to the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelveth River.
The shooters then boarded his car and crashed it not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
In Culiacan, the news seems to spread rapidly.
But in Valdez's case, it's suspicious silence.
Since last year's arrest of Guzman and his January edition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions try to fill an empty spot.
Several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi every day, and the cemetery is filled with two-storey mausolees for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget it for a moment that the word "transmit" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that travel drugs to the United States.
In contrast, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and director of Riodoc, continues to blame himself for not protecting his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaquín Guzman.
Peace could anger the sons; the suspected gang members bought all the copies of the newspapers the moment they landed on the desks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after other newspapers were confiscated in the same story.
Valdez became a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight against journalists against Mexican criminals.
He had been able to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In the Noroeste periodical, he was practically a veteran when he decided to sell his share of $50 in 2003 and set up together with five Riodoc colleagues.
In Sinaloe, "it was impossible to operate a newspaper without mentioning drug trafficking," Bojorquez said.
In time, Riodoc gained a good reputation for brave and true intelligence; the newspapers began to succeed.
Journalists liked to go looking for problem topics and publish texts without censorship - the reader was fascinated to read stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoc won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for the Latin America story.
The same year Valdez won the International Freedom of the Press Committee on Journalism for his brave reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted he was scared.
"I was afraid for my life," he said when accepting the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is “a way of life,” said Valdez last October in an interview for Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take on the role of journalist - or play stupid.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do to the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
Riodoc's employees miss Valdez. The man was familiar with his jokes and unchosen language. He was a good friend who liked giving advice and hugging - a teacher who knew how to survive.
They all depended on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to El Guayabo bar across the street from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask, did this routine of his death cause him?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like you getting involved with their women, their children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like there's something wrong here, hands off.
The problem is, editor Riodace Andres Villarreal said that "the smell is a sense that can be tricked... and then the Javier thing happened."
The old rules according to him, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloae - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the meeting room of Riodoc staff; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which bought governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief before the 40-degree heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were chosen by the State to protect the offices of Riodoc, which are located in a four-storey building in the city district of Culiacanu.
Journalists are taunting themselves whether these police officers belong to those 50 percent of law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It's been a few months since journalists went to the highlands that basically control the drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the program this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloe.
They also have a light on suspicious government spending in the hometown of the Governor of the State.
Several kidnappings have recently occurred in one of the most luxurious restaurants in Culiacán, just a block from the State's Attorney's office.
Officially, no one has reported the identity of the kidnapped or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were careful when they were about to write about what every citizen of the city knows: that she restaurant is a popular destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from the public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with high-ranking corruption.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents in the restaurant, including an incident involving one of the sons of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmana escaped from the military task force.
A month ago, readers would have read about this topic in Valdez's section, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal (46), who is called "El Flaco" for his lean figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse with signs and stickers for protests against killing journalists.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several signs and went to demonstrate herself in front of the D.A.'s office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of the state of Michoacán.
The authorities say it's Adame's DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is increasing throughout the country, many of which are organizing protests and snooping on the pavements and buildings of the "SOS press".
The director of the newspaper Bojorquez is a day at a visit to Washington, D.C., where he tries to gain international support and achieve justice for Valdez's death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloy, which took place the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of watching journalists and their murder of reporting the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department of concern that her anger might compromise her impartiality.
Valdez repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists were “wildered” by organized crime, corrupt officials and indifferent to the public.
In his last book "Narco-journalism" he wrote that journalists were dying not only by the hands of drug cartels but also by ordering politicians and security forces that cooperated with organised crime.
The media supervisory group Articulo 19 accused more than half of all attacks on journalists of police officers and public officials.
"In Mexico, you will die because they want to silence you," said Ramirez.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who occurred six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up for my messages.”
There were keyboards and headphones next to the severed head.
Some branches have decided to terminate their activities, such as the newspaper El Norte, based at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of rapporteur Miroslava Breach.
Others are still continuing, just like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing their director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the opening page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015, along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after the escape from Veracruza.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, they pose a great risk every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, which is why I became a journalist," he said.
It's Friday's midnight, and Riodoc's employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition was sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone rings.
They find out that 19 people died in a gunfight between gang members and policemen near the beach resort in Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as many messages left in this area promised.
Journalists publish this news from their mobile phone on the Riodoc website.
Not one day will pass and the opening title will change again.
Sounds of police sirens point to another shootout.
Bojorquez throws a glimpse of the police patrol to see if they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show up.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodicity - whose mediator is an eloquent slogan for Sinaloe - all Riodoc employees follow his steps.
"How could we think about leaving," Bojorquez said, "when one intern asked me to send her to the streets the same day Javier was killed?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
The researchers have now discovered the conclusions of the first findings of an amazing creature of the size of a rhinoceros whose perfectly preserved remains - which experts called "Mona Lisa's dinosaurs" - found a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such an extent that experts were able to identify the red brown color of his scaly skin and reported that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
An article in Current Biology reported that it is the “most preserved ever found armored dinosaur and one of the best types of dinosaurs in the world. ”
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaurus lived in the period of the Wings, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by researchers who described him with the words “very remarkable. ”
According to National Geographic, the defensive white shark is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who revealed the fossil on March 21, 2011 when drilling in the Suncor Millenium near Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years discovering an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
After completion of work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
“It’s enough to turn a blind eye and believe he’s asleep,” said Caleb Brown, head of the Royal Tyrrell Museum and naturalist of the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exposed.
'He will surely enter history as one of the most beautiful and preserved species of dinosaur - Mona Lisa dinosaurs.'
In the study of his skin, researchers found that this herbivore - even though it was covered with armor and resembled a walking tank - was most likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a cloaking system that uses many animals today.
The masking system suggests that he was popular with the food of larger dinosaurs.
News of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in the newspaper in May. It is currently available to visit the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named him Borealopelta Markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7000 hours carefully discovering fossils along with the team.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of the scales and armors all over the body.
They discovered a method of cloaking, which they commonly use to protect today's animals - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part of the animal.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising, because Borealopelta's size far exceeds the present animals using the same technique.
So it's possible that the dinosaur was so many predators that evolution chose masking over confrontation in survival.
Many current animals with masking - such as deer, zebra and or a belt-liner - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, indicating that the nosodaurus had to fight for its surviving literally.
“The formulation of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators in the period of chalk,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic ingredients contained in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skin probably had red brown colouration.
Researchers continue to study the animal and seek further knowledge of his life, including the preserved stomach contents, to search for his last meal.
He believes the dinosaur fell into the river after death and was taken to the sea where he sank to the bottom.
At the time, the climate was the same as that of Florida and the rivers today, and the oceans were much further inland than today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in the fact that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time is preserved in three dimensions and so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as at the time of the chalk.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to take your eyes off a little bit and it seems like he's asleep.'
During the Cretaceous period, huge teropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, were walking on two legs.
Although the king of all the dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been the popular prey of his equally horrific ancestors.
These include Acrocanthosaurus, 11.5 metres long monster with a weight of over 6 tons.
Researchers whose latest findings were published in Current Biology believe that Borealopelt's body was washed up in the sea after he was mummified in the mud.
Behind the find is Shawn Funk, who revealed the fossil on March 21, 2011 when drilling at the bottom of Suncor Millenium near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the nose to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 metres and weighed up to 1300 kg.
His shoulders were two inches [50 cm] of bar.
The researchers believe that this herbivore was plundering the territory of today's Canada until he ended up in a river that had sailed him into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored sheets around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote the gate for National Geographic, “finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the shocking finding seems to me.
Fossil remains of this kind are also preserved to the extent that armored sheets around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with his fingers pointing upwards.
I'm easily counting the scales on his feet.'
How did one activist know the answer to the question, ‘Whose Streets?’
August 9, 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaking all over her body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native from St. Louis sat on a bed in the Airbnb room and went through Facebook posts on her phone.
She ran into a high school student's contribution.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharaah kept retweeting her Wall posts.
Rapper from St. Louis published on Twitter his papers on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, who was shot by a white-skinned police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photograph of Brown's body, which lies helplessly on the street, from where no one took it even after four hours.
"This is crazy," Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She hung up on her phone to get back to him the night she was watching tweets about people gathering for Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the father of the victim and held a sign in his hand saying, "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She watched live news - one of the police officers stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a lead in his hand and at his other end of a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, as she said, held a gun in his hand that he was aiming at the crowd and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and we can call normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
"I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight right away and traveled home the next day.
After landing at 11:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson in the next three years describes the new document, "Whose Streets?", which will be released to the cinemas on August 11.
It's a story about survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and integrity told from the perspective of people living in the community who go out to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced a dialogue with her daughter, dressed in a flower dressing and the same flower forehead - about a topic they had discussed many times before - "the experience with blacks".
"Do you remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" recalls the interview.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It did not seem that I would not take it with me," later Ferrell said.
“Today’s events are the culmination... that has taken place in the past.
She had to know and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but also to know the difference between different layers of experience with black people and what we had to do to free ourselves.
Even though I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own skin, she does not differ in any way from another black child-wife.
I feel like if I had protected her from this experience, I would only have hurt her."
Upon arriving in Ferguson, South Florissant Road was the first stop across from the police department, which became the base of activists who expected Officer Darren Wilson's words about his possible participation in the incident.
This is where Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing for the rest of the food.
Together, they prepared food in bags and helped spread it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism was slowly born.
"My activism turned upside down after 9 August," Ferrell said, adding that during her studies at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn association and sought health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during the demonstration, Ferrell met with a later co-director, Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Farrar, wanted to "only document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought: “Are you working on a document, or are you trying to find a story to be used?
Such a type of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people who wanted to make money for pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a given conversation: “We have heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected, and we wanted to change that.”
Folayan has already established cooperation with co-director Damon Davis, who is a respected local artist who deals with the topic of prisoners in the death row.
His participation in the project was also interested in Ferrell and along with six other local residents who were following the Whos Streets team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement," said Davis.
"That was important to me - as these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement “not about a savior leader, but about bringing the community closer together,” Folayan said - it turned out that it is she who is most open to filming.
The Whose Streets document describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, for example, how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face thinking about the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
"But I understand that in order to do this job and to polish black people, I have to open up."
The story of Ferrell also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created in response to the killing of Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on the social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter - call themselves freaks.
"Black eccentric women in the leading positions are ultimately in favour of maintaining the movement," Ferrell said, "because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events."
Folayan agrees with this comment and adds that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a great deal of eccentric black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a mere and authoritative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her opinions.
"It was she who was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"that she was in the front lines is not a coincidence, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black strange woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy rush in front of the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the cameras of the television stations have cleared their positions, but the heavy racial bonds between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell's serving a two-and-a-half-year probation for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
Socially, the political atmosphere in the area she calls home is described as "The Disorder."
Still, she hasn't stopped her efforts to which she's been committed since she left for Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
All we can lose are our chains."
There was a field burning in Cologne.
Tens of firemen came to the scene, helped by a helicopter.
Not far from České Brod, in Kolínsko, between the villages of Bleny and Liblice, there was a burning field of about 15 hectares from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 3:15 p.m., the firemen declared the third degree of fire alarm from four possibles.
According to the spokesman of the fireman Ladislav Holomčík, both the fire and the helicopter helped to fire from the air.
At 6 p.m., the firefighters managed to put out the fire, the fire caused damage for 700,000 crowns.
Tens of professional and voluntary firemen fought the flames on the scene.
The fire was caused by a technical defect in the engine compartment of the harvester.
Hasit also helped the helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water.
"The place of intervention has been handed over to the owner until 8 p.m. tomorrow, the voluntary fire department will guard him," said Holomčík.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery is placed just a few faces of different skin shades - white, black and brown - hung from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them seems to have fallen out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were made by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the oral and hair swabs that Chelsea Manning sent her.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where an ex-analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cabograms on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, bears the name A Being Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, IT and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneer dissident, whose punishment Obama reduced three days before leaving the post of President of the USA.
The algorithmic DNA analysis of Manning and the use of 30 portraits to illustrate what a person would look like with this genotype, created Dewey-Hagborg's sharp, if not intellectual commentary on the submissiveness of DNA - as well as many ways that DNA can be interpreted - and the inseparable determinism of these interpretations as well as identities.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about being a woman since she was a young woman. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of 20 charges, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud, and theft.
All of her photos were held by prison staff. Only one lower quality black and white photograph has escaped in the public, which Manning, visibly concerned, is sitting in the driver's seat in a platinum blonde wig that she is now associated with.
In 2015, positive reactions to the Dewey-Hagborg project from 2012 Stranger Visions continued.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg has used various forensic objects - such as cigarette and gum nails - to create a picture of possible forms of these people.
And at this time, she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were going to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to complete the article with a portrait," Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea asking if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her trapped muse became friends within two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, who presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea had been pardoned and could have attended the exhibition in person.
Indeed, President Obama, a few days after the release of the comic book, asked for Manning's release, which was a welcome change after several insufferable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It is interesting, indeed, that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is at war with people seeking to publish government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to incite hatred in the areas that he should support.
In answer to a question about this special timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything is happening for a reason".
Under a statement by an artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls for her huge signature (the letter "i" in her last name is worded with a heart) after the end of "self-employed fraction, which is based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side there are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a centipede of letters C, G and A recorded in pencil.
By classifying 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist) Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all together.
"I hope that people will take away from this, that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way," said Dewey-Hagborg. Her work Spurious Memories from 2007 on the subject of video is also visible.
"THE DAY tells many different stories, this is 30 of them."
The last specimen of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning, which appears as King Kong from the United States Disiplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
"As soon as they stop you from speaking, they win," it says.
"Never be silenced."
“It’s a direct transcript from one of the letters,” she said.
"When I think about it, my skin's creeping."
Manning has so far not personally visited the exhibition - which was foretold in the comic book - but when it does, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by her masks, her own genome forms, arranged as a crowd of Protestants.
Which was also the purpose of the exhibition, including almost 160 cm of the high statue of Manning, to which its genetic haplogroup is recorded by pencil.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted the feeling of the crowd to come out of them," Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits.
"I wanted the impression of mass movement, which takes the form of Chelsea and liberates it."
Professor of Northwest University and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
These days, a national search for a professor of the North West University and the employees of Oxford University, who are being prosecuted for suspicion of the murder of a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago, has been reported by the police.
On Monday, a first-degree arrest warrant was issued for a man named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in Trenton's death, Mr James Cornell-Duranleau, reports Cook County.
The paper says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several stab wounds.
Chicago P.D. said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
The police have been informed by telephone of this fact, and after arriving at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating a murder case.
Lathem has worked as a professor of microbiology and immunology at the North West University since 2007.
Alan K. Cube, Vice President of the University of Public Relations, stated in his e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university's school premises.
"The whole matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the North West University is fully cooperating with them," said Cuba.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
The university spokesperson and Somerville College stated in a statement sent by e-mail: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist US police as well.”
It also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the fact and wish to apply to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Public Relations with the Chicago Police Department, stated that he was calling on suspects to surrender to the competent authorities.
"Police has information about their whereabouts and the search for suspects is escalating," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on 27 July.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza headquarters issued a statement to all residents: "Police is now working on the timing and profile of the victim and investigating various motives, including domestic violence."
"In the near future, we will complete the plan of WADA" - Vice-President of the Russian government Mutko
Vice-President of the Russian Government Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
‘Some of the criteria of the new plan have already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this, the WADA plan was updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutek, the code does not contain anything that should disturb Russia.
“It has been announced and everything will also be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of these criteria, however, calls for the results of the WADA investigation, which Richard McLaren investigated, to be publicly announced by the government of Russia, to sponsor the doping of Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has apparently failed.
It has been joined by all measures.
But there were no state programmes in our country, and we cannot confess to something that never existed."
Mutkov's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In an interview for Russia’s RSport Smirnov admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but he added: “On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one is planning to accept the report without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of taking out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July, CEO WADA Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA was “on the right path” for renewal.
Police have charged three people, one of them juvenile.
Police have accused three men of setting up a rare wooden church fire in Třinci-Gutech, Frydeck-Místeck, Wednesday.
One accused is juvenile, all three are Czech nationality.
They've been in prison for up to 15 years for a general threat.
Reporters were told today by Moravian-Silesian police director Tomáš Kužel.
He thought it was an intentional crime.
"It is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," said Kžel.
He said the police would discuss possible arrest of the accused.
Further information according to the Director cannot be published.
"There's more I can't tell you, because the criminal police and investigation staff are actually working on things, and the prosecutor who's overseeing the case," Kuzel said.
The wooden church of God’s body in Gutech came from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage will go to tens of millions of crowns according to preliminary estimates, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, consideration began to be given to restoring the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, additional costs are ready to be shared by the Ministry of Culture and the city, public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. local parishes.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed the fire 15 years ago.
It caused a fault in the wiring back then.
It was then replaced by exact copies.
The state is counting on citizens to defend the state.
It'll support their training.
With financial support for associations that can be used in the defence of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of trainers, the actual intention of the Act on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is calculated.
The Ministry of Defence, which received its processing as a task from the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their ability, which could then be used by the state in crisis situations.
It's based on a proposal that the Ministry has prepared.
If the law had been adopted in the future, the state would have spent hundreds of million crowns to support the brandiness of the order.
The basic aim of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the performance of their chosen duty and on the basis of voluntaryity.
The State would, for example, financially or materially support the associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow to increase the ability of their members.
In return, he would have obtained data on people who are willing to come to the aid in times of crisis and their abilities or material equipment if necessary.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help the public and other interested parties with their training or training.
It also counts on organizing talks with war veterans or people who behaved heroicly.
One of the possible variants assumes that a new office would be created, which would be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and that the state would use their abilities only after the announcement of the state of danger.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual wiping of previously obvious borders between different types of threats," is stated in the intention to refer to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that it is therefore necessary to focus on the promotion of a widest range of capabilities, not just military ones.
"The basic aim of the intention is to create a very wide base that allows every citizen to respond in a qualified way to situations that threaten the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect himself, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to avoid difficulties in carrying out the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic," states the intention.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial claims.
According to the Ministry, the above will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Authority envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the state's defence up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million a year.
More money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also assumes that it would have to extend the scope of the regional military headquarters, which would employ 42 other soldiers together.
Representatives of the Ministry previously stated that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of a European Union directive on arms possession.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons that the directive promises.
startups that will help your company not to become another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction rate of her staff's e-commerce startup, but she didn't find an adequate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And even though she promised the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust in the entire process.
"I looked for consistency and objectivity," said Errett, owner of the hair care company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, employing 75 people.
So she asked for help from outside.
New start-ups from the field of human resources are constantly emerging on the market to help companies survey their employees’ satisfaction.
By creating and licensing software with a particular intention of measuring employees' obligations, start-ups enable companies to make quick votes, target specific teams and demographic groups, and also offer absolute anonymity of employees and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow informants to circumvent their superiors and contact the director directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit, which follow your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Glint startup based in Reedwood City.
Errett said that Glint has gained greater awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and votes of specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and a common overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - which allows the user to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the working environment - in case they become another Uber - who is thrown away in scandals after the former employee posted a post on his blog describing the company environment and harassing employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, demand for surveys of corporate culture is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to Let's Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector can exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
The startup Converter of Denver, Colorado, who helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the scandals of Uber.
Almost 600 Converter clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently accepted under his wing.
Like Glint, the Converter allows companies to send customised flash surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text line that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints shall be sent directly to the Governing Board.
"The Court of Justice has authorised regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and executive director of the Converter startup.
If the company is convicted of improper treatment of its employees or of non-ethical behaviour - and if the regulators do not act - it may face costly consequences as a result of boycotting customers, exhaustion of employees or legal proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, uses Converter for more than a year to raise employees' awareness of corporate principles and procedures and to ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report any problems, he had to track the phone number or e-mail to company management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
Often it was a discouraging and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Secretary General of Ruby Tuesday, according to which there had previously been no reliable way of monitoring employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the Converter, quick detection and resolution of problems that have never gone to managers, sitting in offices, miles away from the actual solution to complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"This is closer to a holistic, overall view of employees' experience," said Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from court disputes by employees."
The companies stopped taking the ethics, values and participation of employees on a light scale in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron fell in the case of the abuse of the ethical rights of employees, Quinlan said.
But only when “the social media lit up the whole thing, ” did companies begin to realize that they could not simply hide their skeletons in the closet in the online world.
"Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith," Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold equity investors, who supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, the Converter selected $10 million in total from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital and finally raised a capital of $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners and gained $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and risk capital.
A growing number of research shows that today’s employees expect more than ever from their workplace.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, the main advantage is not high wages and interesting projects.
Employees want to see that they are received and appreciated and that they are devoted their time to a society that is pursuing a positive mission.
"If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they seek the success of society," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Benefits of LinkedIn, who is also using the Converter and Glint.
Investors earn if companies and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employees' commitment and commitment to society, it is no wonder that there are many investors who will support this effort.
It is important, according to experts in the work culture, to have data on the satisfaction of employees.
But the data itself is pointless unless society takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests feedback from its employees, there may be major changes.
And if change does not happen quickly - in the worst case, at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of the staff.
"When you ask for 4,000 opinions, you must be prepared for 4000 conversations," said Russell Raath, Director of Consulting at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies relying too much on data alone.
“ As soon as you don’t get to the end of things, the employees start asking themselves, ‘ Did they hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, then why should I care?"
Madison Reed, who is currently doing a regular survey every month between employees, is able to solve the problem thanks to Glint in one day, said Errett.
After the assembly of feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision-making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganise several teams within the society and start training communication to resolve the problem successfully.
Ruby Tuesday receives a very important view of its employees and hopes that in the long term it will achieve high employment in the field known for frequent redundancies.
"If you are not seeking to create a transparent working environment, employees will not believe you," added Vitrano.
“And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company will fail."
Thursday became the warmest day.
Thursday is with 38.3 degrees recorded in Strážnice in Hodonínsk so far the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
It overcomes Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
The employees of the Czech Hydrometheorology Institute informed about this.
But unlike Tuesday on Thursdays, there's not a lot of temperature records.
The heat hit mainly Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesdays, the records for 35 out of 145 weather stations, measured over 30 years, were overrun.
Only nine long-term measuring stations recorded their record on Thursday.
For example, in Strážnice, today's temperature was the same as the previous 2013 record.
In Lednice, Břeclavsko, today's 37.4 degrees, the original maximum was four tenths of degrees and in Pohořelice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with Strážnice, came from 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnice, the biggest heat in Dyjákovice was in Znojemsko and Broda nad Dyjí in Břeclav, where mercury came to 37.8 degrees, but the record did not exceed.
For example, in western and northwest Bohemia, according to the ČHMO website, today's highest temperatures have been only around 22 degrees Fahrenheit.
"Temperatures began to grow there later this afternoon," said the meteorologists.
The current heats in the Czech Republic will gradually fade, and more significant rains could come on Sunday.
In most of Moravia, however, high temperatures remain on Friday and southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We've got such a mess here.
Billionaires don't get the same vote in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to make direct decisions, and because not everyone is as rude as Andrei Babiš, who wants to own the state, is buying political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva and other colleagues, Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsor Robejškovy Realisty.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of insurance and real estate entrepreneurs Pavel Zehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
The condemned corruptor and king of the Czech gambling Ivo Valenta have acquired the Privacy Party.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project Andrej Babiš did not want to be named by the Kromeriz mayor Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for itself.
The Mayors have also recently captured their billionaires.
It is Dalibor Grandpa, owner of the company on the security equipment Jablotron.
According to his own words, he enters politics to do good.
Entrée didn't make it in the mayor's uniform.
"I never dreamed of small targets," he said at a press conference.
That means that my goal is to get the NO movement to get the Mayor movement to get 20 percent in the election.
Leckdo smiled.
But Grandpa's overflow is more like it.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of solid opinion.
Although he intends to apply for the votes of the voters in the Caretaker's uniform, he continues to support Andrei Babiš.
He supported Babiš in the past parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a shot-up speaker and does not control the plethora of political snakes," he wrote before the 2013 elections.
But he certainly doesn't go into politics because he wants to make himself better.
For me, Babish will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world, under control, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed from his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to co-operate with Babish.
Some may appreciate the fact that Grandpa does not change his mind and stands behind him no matter what shirt he wears.
Others may speculate whether Babiš sends to the Mayors to build his bee so clumsy.
Others may ask whether the boss of Jablotron and the boss of Agrofert broke up in a bad way in the store, looking for another way to defend his business rival.
But the first granddad's public performance wasn't just about Babish.
Grandpa promised to send the Mayors ten million crowns to the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard for anyone to suspend a statement like that.
After all, the court-appointed gauner, Zdeněk Bakala, threw millions at all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Víta Barty, TOP 09 and the citizens' democrats came together for nearly 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law forbids any political party to give more than three million.
When Grandpa enters politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
Then maybe he wouldn't have to ask himself why politics has such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics, Grandpa crowned with a proposal for tax advantages for families with studied children.
People with higher education come to our house for about 50,000 a month.
The ones with the basics on less than 20.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in local conditions.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Grandpa's vision, the poor pay taxes fairly, and the rich enjoy the benefits of a social state that they do not participate in.
In fact, the rich need help to avoid suffering from need.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition, and Babish can shake hands.
The rest of us thanks to Grandpa, we can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
There's still a question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who do not hold members and members of their parties, or citizens and citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
Finally, those who want to live well in a rich land for all people, not just for some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to cost $234 million.
The sale of real estate is sometimes not easy.
And often not even 11 bedrooms, a beautiful view of the sea, or the fact that the property is being sold by President Donald Trump.
At the time of the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down with an incredible 8 million pounds.
Mirror.co.uk informed about it.
The brochure says, "Hi, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like any other.
But even the connection between a real estate company and the US president did not defend an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to reduce the price of his Caribbean seat by an incredible £8 million.
The original property price was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex stands as about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees planted on the property.
There is a beautiful view of the sea from the terrace.
According to real estate experts, the price showed that the connection with the president was not sufficient to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the current prices of properties on the island.
Trump bought real estate in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around £15 million.
The property was to be purchased for the purpose of renting.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With the new price, however, she ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
NCAA has decided to stop two trainings a day. For Bruins there are long days
The 11th morning is coming and UCLA US football players are at the side of the new school course.
Some of them take off their uniforms and expose sweaty backs, the unscrupulous sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most of the team members, a few minutes of doing nothing adds a lunch break.
Players registered in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting to be held in the morning at 6:30.
"For these boys, the next three days, there'll be a lot of work," said coach Bruins Jim Mora just before Monday turned around on Tuesday.
By excluding two trainings in one day, NCAA wants to lighten up the players - paradoxically they are even longer training days - at least until Friday, when the final exam ends.
This is why the first three trainings of UCLA are scheduled for 19:15 - to be sealed into the already so-called diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons, which Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and the trainings are limited during the summer semester.
In total, 18 trainings are scheduled until 20 August, and the formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team are taking place in September.
Mora heard that he supported the decision of the NCAA, even though he added another item to the already loaded player's schedule.
"Three or four days are players under great stress and it is very exhausting for them," Mora said.
“But no one gave up, everyone’s trying. They’re great.
I think Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down."
The UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of the surrounding plots from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center hotel, which the players occupied after harvesting the protective net behind the gate poles.
Bruins players should take over the hotel from this week onwards, but Mora acknowledges that when the rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will guard the security service," said Mora.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our trainings.
It's a good deal to deal with that kind of material.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking lot 8.
We'll use our resources at maximum.
I believe everything will be fine.
It's all planned."
Facebook plans a more thorough fact check to limit the number of false messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to control third parties and display findings under the original contributions in an attempt to fight the so-called “fake news”, stated the largest social network on Thursday.
The company writes in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible Hoaxes which will send third parties to verify and potentially display the results of the survey under the original contributions.
Facebook was referred to as one of the main sources of false reports, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's election by the President of the United States.
Political debates are taking place in Europe. French voters are flooded with false reports on the May presidential elections, and Germany is planning to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September elections if it does not quickly eliminate angry contributions.
On Thursday, in his next statement in Germany, he stated that he was about to start testing a new function of checking false messages in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to displaying reports verified by third parties, people want more content to be better informed and can make the right decision about what they can share," said Sara Su, Facebook news company's product manager.
She added that Facebook continues to test the function of "related articles" and is also working on other changes in order to reduce the number of false messages.
Create a graphic novel: a story about A Castle in England
A small Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the music video of the Squeeze group, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotney, from his cozy place at the Bewl River in Kent, England, witnessed a turbulent story of 700 years, inspired by curly Jamie Rhodes from the York county - known for his popularity in historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"A look at the writing of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me," says Rhodes with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
A graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who resided in Scotland Castle from the Middle Ages to the Eduardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not the first Rhodes book inspired by archives: it is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stores (2014), a collection of inspired documents from the British Library - a project that was very emotional to him.
"I was interested in a thumbprint on a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jacobites," he said.
“This is his thumbprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those days, you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell a letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
How I love archives!"
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the possibility to stay at the castle almost four months as a dream. (“To tell the truth, I have extended my stay a bit.”)
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, going through archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyenas on the wall and bottles that have been dumped for centuries in the ditch.
He walked through the property and explored the ruins of the old castle, talked to the haughty, gardeners and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
In the night, he was "drinking whiskey and writing".
The confidential history of Scotney is a relatively large unknown, as the National Trust organization gained access to documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff began to penetrate into the archives that Rhodes described in words, as if "the Aristocrats of many centuries were throwing their hands around, saying, "Take it to the attic."
Journals, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting property: “Maybe you think the dispute about land is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I found one case where two families were pulling the edge.
Stop it, people!"
Some stories in the book use the castle as a reflection bridge and drill deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Uprising in 1381.
"I found a record of a rebellion at the 1380 Castle, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book," said Rhodes.
“The English Uprising actually started in this area and I thought that rebellion is a good starting point.
Maybe in the end he's connected."
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle - for example The Priest, who tells the story of a Jesuit priest whose family was hidden by Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, a 18th - century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered several years after the coffin was discovered).
Rhodes’ favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by the male generation — then men were always in debt and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The different generations of the Darrell family solved this by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to confuse their heirs' heads."
He's been searching for Rhodes for more adventures with the end of his stay at the castle.
He recently returned from a two-week stand in the Finnish wilderness, where he inspired his next book on Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was absorbed by nature.
But it's a strange place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I said to myself, "Now I'm going to get the hell back to real life."
Washington changes the terms of the green card award
The media has published President Donald Trump's words on the new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change when granting a green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on the granting of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will achieve this by changing the rules for green card issues for residents of other countries.
The law limits the number of immigrants and replaces the current scheme.
The new application process will be preferred by the English-speaking applicants, who run through funds and will demonstrate the skills that will benefit our country," Trump, quoted by the media.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, there will be a report on the technological development of sex robots on the Internet.
Yes.
Sexual robots are now really popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently issued a statement on the development of sexual robots in the next five to ten years.
According to a former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharpy, it is necessary to look seriously at the rise of sexual robots.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot nails.
"People make fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be ready to see them more and more," said Sharpy on the occasion of the publication of the report.
Modern sexual aids change from inflatable master to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to touch - of course there is artificial intelligence that mimics the behavior of a person.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very worrying that many robots have their own "personality" that would shame the stepford mistress.
Modern inflatable virgins evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set various character features for his replacement woman, including shyness.
And then there is the sexual robot woman Roxxy Gold of True Companion, which is supplied with pre-programmed personalities, including the "frigous Farrah", which is characterized by the shy nature and "wildness of Wendy" with the "appropriate" nature.
"The Roxxxy Gold feature is set to suit your personality as much as possible," says True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, callin', or "in the mood."
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - among which does not include confusion for real interpersonal relations. More worrying are the inferior female traits and violent incitements - e.g. frigid (read-reflecting) Farrah.
The True Companion company on its website is similar to the Roxxxy's vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have Roxxxy?" says the page.
But sexual robots are not just fetishes or sexual devices.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or sexual equality towards desire for captivating sex with an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, don't buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots are still on the verge of public interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set today.
And most people are not weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world acquire their rights, and in the White House, a president who often expresses himself very vehemently at the address of a woman sits.
The most terrible aspect of the story The maid's story is not what we see - hanged bodies and sculpted eyes, as rather the reality of these visions.
The story of the servant is a step in the right direction, but at present it seems to be a small step.
Sexual robots should as much as possible resemble real women (for example, with rates of porn actresses).
Their creators construct them to be pleasant to touch and act at first sight as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality, ” the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing to incite their independence or undermine their commitment to their master.
In other words, they're nice slaves.
He says 21st century: maids.
The NBA star on the green armpit.
Curry's fighting for cut in California.
Despite the screwed-up first hit at the premiere start among professional golfers, the star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose himself.
Double award holder for the most useful NBA player played at Ellie Mae Classic lower series Web.com Tour in California's Hayward first round at 74 shots and will fight for cut.
The player Golden State, who won second in the NBA with the Warriors team this season, started a lot nervously and his first hit ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked by a fairway.
Even though he was not as accurate between the pits as under the basketball basket, he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four shots over a pair.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, to have to call the referee right after the first hit, but then a little saddled up," Curry said, saying, "He's in great trouble.
It was very nervous to blow up the first blow at the tournament, but it was all I was hoping for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight the cutie, which will probably be set two shots under the steam, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I'm getting rid of the tremation, that's fine," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played celebrities and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time at a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he obtained a sponsor's exception and maintained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Against that, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unscrupulous sign of Trump’s era is the political dissolution that divides American voters and breaks the entire family apart on a micro scale.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, in American newspapers, it was full of advice to deal with relatives who chose Trump.
We're supposed to be waiting for them to let us in.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to cement the family.
I'm talking about this because my cousin, a poet and a leftist fan who lives in Chicago, who has been paying for a long time in our family for a Republican fool.
She reminded me that the murmur in the face of a common enemy can have a strong effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, the whole family is suddenly - including all the Republican siblings, who have been arguing about politics for years - on one wave.
At dinner at the family table, it is a good thing; but I am impressed that this poses a significant risk in the wider context.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all out to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that his clowns may one day lose their attractiveness.
However, there is an even more horrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly become an embodiment of what can be called rational.
In these nostalgic ones in my heart today, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy act - the dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we had a awareness of his tax return) - both of which look like very mild offences compared to Trump.
After Trump's departure, it is enough that the subsequent Republican candidate is at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We used my cousin's visits and we took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel running the New York Park Department - you won't find better use for your three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the middle roller is covered with glasminate - clowns and animals are filmed and staring at their own shoulders in horror - a completely cloudy view and cynical music surprisingly reminds us of public transport.
Many clichés will soon be frozen: the view from the tall buildings, the panorama looks at you instead of breathing the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your ideas.
Thirty years later, I still did not get over the fact that Swiss Cottage is not actually Swiss cheese - not counting the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage - but the subway station in London.
However, the cycling in Central Park is a remarkablely magical experience, to the extent that two children, as well as two mature women, are having a great time.
If I could rate the carousel, he would have earned the maximum points, but luckily no one asks.
This week, I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to evaluate my "event" on a scale from one to five when paying with a credit card.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same, except I can add 15% to the rating for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only is it slowing down sales otherwise, but the waitress is forced to barge into the favor of shoppers when it is not necessary.
My wife in the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly evaluated my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time that Pistorius had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for lacerations on his wrist, which, according to the prison's statement, he caused himself to fall in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing the original murder sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp early in the morning on Valentine's Day 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet closet in his Pretoria house.
Pistorius claimed he mistook her for a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to rescind, this time against the six-year penalty of Pistorius, which, according to their words, is too mild.
National Prosecuting Authority has stated that it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius is threatened to extend his sentence for up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in her history, she gave birth to a captive cub, a bred panda that was burned in the wilderness.
It's a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The Centre is trying to expand a Genofond of captive pandas.
The center worker Chang Č-chung told Nová China that panda breeding is at great risk from related crossings.
Only 471 pandas lived in captivity at the end of last year.
In the wild, only two thousand survive.
Trying to mate the captured pandas with the savages is so the first step towards helping the panda breeding to protect this species.
Fifteen-year-old Cao-cchao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists could observe every step of it.
She met her chosen Cchao-chao 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with a male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even that can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal realm.
Males relatively misjudge the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The young was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed after giving birth 216 grams.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in the territory of Greece for illegal camping, quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained on August 1st in the morning by the Sithonian police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated to the bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is caught in a place where no camping is permitted.
The controls will take place all season.
The Ministry has stated that the court may impose fines.
Spilka is number 50 after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Klára Spilka is standing after the first round of the British Open in 50th place.
The field in the Scottish Kingsbarns bypassed the score of one blow under the pair when she played three birdies and two Bogeys.
So a twenty-two-year-old Czech player has the hope that he will pass the cutie for the first time on the famous major.
The entry into the $3.25 million grant contest was the best American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the field record 64 shots, eight under pairs.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands download millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry establishments due to the incident.
According to Reuters, the Netherlands Food Safety Supervisory Authority (NVWA) announced that it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, which means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of types of eggs identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesperson Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also joined to close breeding, have not recently imported into the Czech Republic.
However, the veterinarians shall take random samples of eggs and chicken originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, on whose markets the problem brands of insecticide appeared.
Eggs from Belgium were last in April and eggs from the Netherlands last in May according to the veterinary administration on the Czech market.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of anti-bleaching products, everything and ticks.
However, they must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The WHO World Health Organization considers the preparation to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to feeling sick and dizzy.
Riga is beautiful, I'm gonna miss her, says goalie Sedláček, looking for an engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"I'll just go back there one day," smiled at 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in a zlin uniform.
It depends if he gets his engagement by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you had in Latvia?
If I were to rate it like a school, it'd be three.
I didn't catch much for the first year, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I've been studying.
I started catching the second year.
Before the third season, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I took turns again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch all the time.
But during the opening ten games, we only scored five points, so the trainers started shooting.
At the end, he was catching my colleague more.
But that's how you do it.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Beautiful.
It's a small Prague.
Beautiful, European, historical city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How challenging is the KHL for goalkeepers?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slavan, who have to change their game style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem in the field width.
The difference is the Russians want to play blank.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Didn't it bother you to travel and move over seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually done by playing maybe four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians even see their club in KHL?
Like a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball, it's a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even though it didn't work out, there were a lot of people walking.
Did Dinam’s action in the KHL help to make Latvia almost advance to the quarterfinal at this year’s World Championship?
The KHL has been played since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time on, their results at the World Cup began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1:2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to the KHL they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading for the Czech extra league.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts argued and before signing the contract, Ralfs Freibergs is.
What's with the fact that so many people come here?
They're no bee players, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, the Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still free of commitment?
At the beginning of February, I knew I wouldn't go on in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a goalie budget, we didn't make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but in the finals, they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlin and I'll be waiting for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That was four years ago when I left here and I didn't know what was gonna happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home after a while.
I caught something at the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question is, when and where do I sign?
How real is the variant that you're going to start your new year in Zlin?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, what happens.
Now I can only wait to see what the agent has set up.
Do you prefer a contest?
The past season wasn't enough for me to choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's off-limits at Flight.
In January this year, I wrote in an article with the care of a proper host? I also wrote about a camp in Lety near Orlík.
The nature of the problem remains the same, and so I will allow the fundamental passage of the article to be recalled.
There's been talk of the Lety camp for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what is going on, it will probably be best if they look at, for example, the official pages of the cultural monuments Petty Place Flights.
There, at the outset of the historical overview, they will learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of Lety, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2 August 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were assigned to Auschwitz.
On 4.5. 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp by the largest transport.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad history of enormous sufferings of human beings, which again caused human beings and degenerate ideology.
There is no dispute that these events need to be kept in mind.
There is no dispute that this recollection should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s it was near and a pork was built on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was randomly discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 the memorial was discovered in the Lety.
In the mid-1990 ’ s, the government promised to buy and break down the pork, but it has not yet happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration under the Lidice Memorial has fallen.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close the pork.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
Until last fall, the government approved the buy-back of the pig and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pigs.
According to the Minister of Culture Herman, "there are some numbers, but I'd probably be wasting my intentions if I went public with them."
Let's see what the expert's up to.
According to some unofficial estimates, it could be hundreds of millions, according to others the price could reach a billion.
Either way, it's not gonna be cheap.
And yet, just a few hundred meters from the former camp, there is a monument to which the state invested almost 10 million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was financed by the United Nations Committee on Human Rights, which is probably not a threat, I think it would be just as much a waste of money.
Doesn't the government have any other priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of care, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that has taken place, and anyone who wants to, there, may bow to the memory of the suffering and the murdered.
I see no reason to change that!
Let's just keep it as it is, and let's keep the safety spot with maximum care.
The responsible person, in this case, the Government of the Czech Republic, should treat the care of the proper economy.
At least with one of your own!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But I still see from the point of view of the above facts the password of the leader movement YES only as an empty election proclamation.
This May, I went straight to the spot.
Very decent driveway, modified parking lot, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own petite location, made of stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, how it is and belongs.
Currently, archeological research is taking place at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether, for example, a part of the exposed foundations could not be preserved and, in an appropriate manner, at least visually made available.
In this direction, Daniel Herman, Minister for Culture, could exert his efforts.
In the event that he manages to enforce the buy-back of hens for state money in the government, it will be another unfortunate step in his already problematic functioning as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and milk products to relieve symptoms. However, Washington University researchers have found that the essential triptophan amino acid contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote bowel resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, head of the study, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes are removed from the food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once the weight bowls are inclined to the side of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
Research has identified the presence of immune cells that promote body tolerance in the stomach of mice with specific bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a connection between one species of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a common part of intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that promote body tolerance.
The more tryptophan they had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies also to humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
A postgraduate researcher named Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while a second group of the same mice kept separately cells lacked.
It came from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and moulds, which commonly reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The meslin was tested by DNA sorting method and researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing a second group of mice.
The mice, which were bred in a sterile environment and lacked a intestinal microbiom - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - were given the L. reuteri bacteria - and they formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers developed L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid - without the bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
The immune cells evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it was shown to be a by-product of triptofane metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause the development of cells in humans in the same way as mice, but defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers the signing of the contract with Nemanje Matić and his transfer to Manchester United to be “genial”
Manchester United won a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matić - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the backup debuted in the Wednesday match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed the 40 million pounds contract, presented himself in the first 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season game in front of the UEFA Supercup, where the United will meet with Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in their role as a backup alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić did not have the form and only played 45 minutes, on which, according to Mourinh's words, he should have worked before the start of the next season of the Premier League.
"He needs time, but he is experienced, intelligent and has genius thinking - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get into shape as soon as possible."
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romela Lukaku also played their first game at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho began to form their 11th for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club has done a “fantastic job” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
“Thank the club for helping me get three out of four players,” he added.
"Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they've done their best for me."
The life challenge of the King of Chicken Skins Ladi Peas.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
The multi-promise picture began to be drawn thanks to a new show on the TV Prima Zdeněk Academy.
The pea immediately took a chance.
"Dear Zdeněk, I would like to apply to your cooking academy because I, my hand on my heart, think I can learn a lot from you," he called on in a video on the social media.
And since those two have been tipping for years, Lada hasn't forgotten to turn him on this time.
"In return, I can teach you a znojme from dietary chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is popular," Prushka said.
She's really serious about her participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss says," he said to Lightning.
But he didn't express himself because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, boss!
Pruška's participation in the culinary academy was reacted only by Prima, with the fact that the whole matter takes as his personal activity, which goes beyond TV.
Prussian Pohlreich planted his first cook in December 2004.
In a few days, it sold over 300,000 pieces!
The new show, presented yesterday by Prima at a press conference on the autumn broadcast scheme, is a fake cooking school.
Hurlreich chooses his students from amongst the audience, and in 12 parts they are introduced to twelve chefs.
In the last episode of his show, now the boss is cooking in November 2014, Zdeněk left his shirt on the back of his shirt to iron a cross-checked pear.
If he had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"The pear is healthy and has a lot of vitamins," reacted Láďa.
He thinks about Lady's culinary art.
"Cooking according to Ládi Pruška does not come into the house, because I will not take the gastropunk home," says the boss.
I appreciate Zdenek Pohlreich very much, even I make honey chicken according to him.
On my show, however, his prescriptions will definitely not appear," he did not forgive Peas.
He's an asshole!
He's no chef to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiteracy or asshole," said Pohlreich about Peas at one lecture.
"I'm not 20 to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them anymore," he said.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and house by wavering
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. With a simple wave of hand he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has had a small chip implanted between his thumb and index finger and currently offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their life using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anaesthesiologist at Royal Hampshire County Hospital, Winchester, supervises the implantation and follow-up procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
The Northam company also offers a door and car lock exchange service compatible with the microchip. The price of one castle is £300.
One child’s married father had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he started with a simple wave of his hand.
The White House Requisition cost tax payers thousands of dollars
The White House's decision to arrive with the Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the American manufacturing industry last month came at $24,000, according to the Navy records issued by TIME weekly.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the highlight of the program of July 17 in the White House, which was a show of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials were watching a product show from all 50 countries.
The helicopter from Connecticut was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
A military officer of the White House issued a partial order, or FRAGO, requesting the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landing on South Lawn in the context of an “extraordinary” event, reported the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) - units responsible for the administration of the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such an important event," wrote Commander HMX-1 in his e-mail to his superior, representative of the Navy commander for the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at around 7:00 p.m. on the occasion of the show, the beginning of which is scheduled for 3:00 p.m. and will remain in place until the entire site was fully cleared, scheduled between 6:00 p.m. and 21:00 p.m.
It was further stated in the e-mail that if there was a delay in leaving the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for return flight due to the working time regulation.
The original crew remained on the scene that night, along with the helicopter, along with the security forces.
The records - which the TIME weekly received - did not indicate whether the second crew was finally dispatched.
Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records suggest that HMX-1 is investigating a possible infringement of this Regulation.
“We were wondering if it was a breach of Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine,” wrote the commander.
"It sounds like you were blocked," the deputy commander replied.
This show "Made in America" was marked by the White House as an official event, and Hatch Act would not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
In his participation in the events, the President was promoting a health reform that went through the Senate and talked about trying to keep government regulations under control.
The use of means of air transport such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them to travel.
However, their presence is unusual because of presentational reasons.
Trump ordered control in February after the President's plane was in the background at his first meeting in the Melbourne campaign in Florida. His Twitter account is clouded by complaints about the use of his predecessor's presidential aircraft.
“The White House is pleased with the “Made in America” show, which introduced products from all 50 countries made by Americans from American materials,” said the press secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington area and South Lawn and practice any arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit at the beginning of July in Germany, HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the current training of the crew, said the state official.
On the same day, the helicopter unit flew into the "non-presidential support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House stated that no other props were paid out of taxpayers' money.
The spokesperson Sikorsky stated that the company had no interest in any way in the negotiations for the exhibition of helicopters in South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights and the exact cost of the show is difficult, according to the Navy's comments.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017, the compensation of DoD expenditure for VH-3D 24 380$ per flight hour.
The unit records indicate the time 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are well below that amount.
"Indicating taxpayers' costs on the basis of reimbursement estimates is very misleading," said Walters.
‘These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual costs.’
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD's reimbursements do not include staff costs, but include fuel, maintenance and contractual costs.
The press secretary of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter for the purpose of the show.
“The idea of the show this week is to introduce products produced in the USA,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to the defence of our state and to provide work for hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of helicopters and other military facilities, whose production is attended by countless American citizens.
This fact is to be recalled."
It is not clear whether Trump was also on a helicopter during his tour of South Lawn. It is only possible to say that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky's representative and made jokes with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I own three."
A young woman got stuck in a swamp near Máchovo lake, and the police were looking for her.
The girl left for the beach on Sunday around two o'clock in the morning.
But instead of swimming, she stayed trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask for help from a police officer on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, police officers soon lost contact with her," said police spokesperson Ivana Baláková.
A few police patrols set out to find a young woman, but it was not easy to find a young woman.
"Some of the police officers had to wad the reeds hundreds of meters before they felt the ground again," Balák said.
And so was missing.
The police were focused on the direction in which her call for help was based.
"In order not to lose this connection, they agreed with her to count out loud," said the spokesperson.
Police found a woman in the swamps of Borný in three quarters to five.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological forces and seemed to be a sign of hypothermia.
That's why the ambulance called her to the Czech-Lilipian hospital.

The desired bride becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project searchameslusny.cz, it's like a billionaire told the voters that STAN is suffering from a shortage of decent people.
And he also claimed that a politically incoherent group of less well-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no national program for the parliamentary elections.
Her electoral candidate simply becomes a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, whatever political opinion he has.
That's how Vit Bart used to start, and it didn't work out very well.
In addition, Grandpa also cancels the favorite argument of the head of STAN that the highest value of the movement is politically verified and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, even according to surveys.
Now they're taking care of the unfamiliar personalities they've collected.
Total breakup with the folk, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates.
But if STAN suspected only a few people at the time, after Grandpa came, even the simple game of identity ends.
Not only was Gazdík long defined against YES Andrej Babiš, but Grandpa, who praises Babiš publicly, said as follows: "My goal is to get the Yes movement, i.e. the Mayor's movement in the upcoming elections to get 20 percent."
Let's hope he didn't confuse the movement.
Grandpa is a successful businessman, and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babiš, but unlike him, I will not be his own political brand.
For some time now, STAN has been resembling the reality of the show rather than the real political party, and Grandpa's auxiliary hand seems to make the desired bride even more of a sales girl.
For a while he went STAN with TOP 09, then with the folk and now he's looking for decent people to change.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police dogs practiced in Most through a helicopter
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and search dogs today trained at Lake Bridge by helicopter.
Police dog must not be afraid and afraid of flying, said the head of police cynologists of the Ústecký Region Petr Tomášek.
Police dog training takes about two years.
Both adult trained dogs and those who have been through training have practiced at the Most.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives in the vicinity of the lake and look for a lost figurer, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
So that immediately after the helicopter sits, the dog could go to work so he wouldn't have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"The helicopter sits down, the dog goes and immediately looks," said Tomášek.
A dog who is restless or unable to work immediately on a helicopter journey is excluded from training.
"Most of them then keep them in the garden, for example," Tomášek added.
Police have 76 dogs in the Ústecký Region with various specialties.
German shepherds are predominant, but Belgian shepherds are also increasing.
The puppy takes care of him from a puppy.
"He raises it himself, prepares it for the service the dog will do for us," he added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may reveal potential health hendikes.
If the dog is healthy and unfearful, he takes the first test at 20 months.
"The sharp intervention takes about two and a half to three years," said Tomášek.
The length of police service depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They spend most of their time with their own people.

According to the UN, Afghan democracy is relying on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if all members of the society, including women, attend them on the Wednesday of the UN representative in Afghanistan.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of Mission of the United Nations Auxiliary Mission, said that hundreds of women attend local councils, three women apply for the post of Vice President, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in his Wednesday declaration.
The elections may be fully representative and credible only if women participate in the elections as well as in all related processes related to the elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on April 5.
The Taliban has made several threats against the electoral process that shifts international fighting to a second track.
For the first time in this year's elections, a democratically elected government is handing over its power to a peacefully next government.
Haysom said that the strong role of women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Afghan independent electoral commission stated that the total of 3.6 million registered voters is 1.2 million women.
The unique brewery re-cooks beer.
For a good beer to resurrect the brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to life a few years ago the brewery in Lobč u Mšena.
The brewery, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a Renaissance core, and in the nineteenth century it was converted into an parlour operation.
It followed years of bloom, when the brewery was famous for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II, production was stopped and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have served the state estate.
The work of destruction was made by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was destroyed and disassembled into building material.
In 2007, however, there was a new hope in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzovy.
They started repairing buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully dedicated to the study of archive materials, trying to preserve original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century when its golden era started.
Their work was appreciated by the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became a part of the European industrial heritage trails.
In 2015 they also solemnly restored the tradition of brewing beer.
If you want to taste great Lobečské beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the pub in the brewery area.
The coconut water springs here in the protected landscape area, malt from the Lobečské fields and žatecký hops.
In the barge you will taste the traditional light spoon, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the brewery tour, it's on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and half past.
The biggest artillery fort of Czechoslovakia?
One of the biggest strengths of its type on a global scale?
The Stachelberg fort between Trutnov and Žacléř, on the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí, was thus a unique building.
Originally, it was meant to be composed of up to 12 bunkers connected to vast underground.
There was supposed to be a headquarters, a barracks, ammo warehouses, materials, a power plant, a machinery room and a hospital.
However, the construction ended the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the fans of the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also look here.
The underground is made available from 75 percent!
The area includes, in addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with the exposure and underground as well as the armed object of light fortification, two built-in infantry cabins, trenches and learning trails fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cozy gazebo and stunning landscape views guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building was added to the list next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the Traian Port near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
The Chotěšov monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today forms the huge four-wing building of the convention above the beautiful garden.
The list he made, but unfortunately, belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of being destroyed.
But the eager ones don't want to give up, and they're holding a lot of events in support of the convent.
One of them is another evening for Chotěšov convent this Saturday, August 5th, where Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Vlas, will present the fencing performances and you will see the places of the magnificent large-scale buildings, which are usually not available.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Get to know the plant with one click.
Students with the creation of herbaries and ordinary plant lovers will be helped by the new free application pl@ntNet.
If they are interested in what plant they have just encountered, these applications will advise them.
All they're gonna have to do is photograph the plant, and the app itself recognizes the kind of plant it is.
The new application, which is available for iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre of Ethical and Environmental Education CEV in the Bratislava Mountain Park within the project Secret Life of the City.
The project also involved students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings with teachers in the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the website The Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of the French programmers was to make as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who hold a tablet or cell phone in their hand can go into the woods," said Ivana Poláčková, the project coordinator.
Based on sufficient quality photos of the flower, leaf or fetus of the plant, the application can recognize its name within seconds, which will then be assigned under the photograph in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome that users, after setting up an account, contribute to the application with a picture of a plant that is not yet present in the database.
"The French will assess whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Poláčková said.
Concerns of GMB regarding the investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
Departments require assurance from managers manufacturer of McVitie's cookies about a long-term production commitment at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB stated that, for the time being, the company is silent regarding the potential investment in the Tollcross plant.
There are more than 500 employees working at the factory who produce Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies, among other products.
The owner of McVitie's, Pladis, stated that she had invested more than £5 million in the whole area over the past few years.
She added that the workers and representatives of the trade unions would be "between the first informed" in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company's contractor, the Scottish GMBs expressed their concern that McVitie's "will not be given his promises to finance and modernise production lines."
The main organizer of GMB Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we did not get a clear answer from the builder about the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Many generations of families and workers have worked here, mostly from the local community and the Glasgow region, where the work in the local factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social separation.
From the perspective of work, wages and benefits - and despite the view of Brexit, rising living costs and decreasing slow production - the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie's."
The spokesperson of Pladis said: “The contractor of Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday, and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continuing commitment to the employees and representatives of the trade unions.
Regular meetings with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago and this meeting was openly discussed many problems.
We have spoken to employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operation on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and in the efficiency of traffic.
We very much appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and locality, and in the event of any change in the operation of the local factory, employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar's transfer three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymara to take her side after she has deposited £89 million, i.e. the amount needed to redeem Neymara from the contract, but has this French team warned Barcelona about its record raid three years ago?
The Club Ligue 1 is ready to overcome more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, which paid £89 million for it last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best-paid professional athlete in the world - after tax the PSG team will collect over £500,000 per week.
Barcelona is enraged by the way Neymar terminated his contract, despite the fact that the confidential source confirmed that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world brought to the attention of the President of the PSG three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed its interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid because as soon as someone tries to get one of our players, then surely we will address one of their players,” said Al-Khelaifi.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the line when she expressed interest in PSG's PSG substitute Marc Verratti in the summer.
The PSG made it clear in the sense that under no circumstances would they allow the Italian representative to leave, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill in its presumptuous dealings with Neymara's departure.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widely understood rules?
Donald Trump was noding against anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the US imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madur.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China was doing nothing with the North Korean threat and that it was not going to go on.
Even from that, the idea of sanctions is like shoe straw.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Madur's Venezuela really went on a journey to dictatorship, totalitarianism.
China is just not acting the way the US president wishes.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to summarize all of this so that the ordinary voters, American, European or other, understood what they are based on and what system of rules the sanctions are based on, it would be almost impossible.
In sanctions against Russia, President Trump is merely bringing what President Obama has already set up to do, just giving him an executive stamp.
Then why such a fuss?
Last year, Europe was terrified that if Trump won the US elections, she would embrace Putin and withdraw the sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it's the opposite.
No sanctions are released with Trump, but are tightening.
But Europe is even more scared.
German Minister Zypries says that Trump's sanctions violate international law.
That kosher are just sanctions approved by the United Nations Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian sanctions in the EU.
The European Commission's boss Juncker complains that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
It means that sanctions are to be used only weak enough not to threaten anyone?
A common voters grope.
Three years he has heard that the fate of counter-Russian sanctions depends only on the fulfilment of the Minsk truce agreements in Ukraine.
They are now learning that this is about the EU's energy security.
The voters grope and spread.
Russia is being punished for being too mounted where it doesn't have to be.
China is being depleted for having little installed.
The Venezuelan President is being punished for building a dictatorship at the borders of his country.
All those penalties or only considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system or a rule or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I do not consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossing the Republic with his visionary book and finishing the election program.
In addition to the Pardubicky Region, he has all the candidates ready.
According to his words, he did not interfere significantly with them.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian-Silesian chief and shadow minister of education, YES Ivo Vondrak.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a Member or a captain," Babiš confirmed his earlier opinion.
You've upset a lot of representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and wardens should run the municipalities and cities themselves, just with the managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am in favour of direct democracy, we are voting directly for the President, and I believe that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about disturbing the representatives, they can be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
In the presentation of your book, what I'm dreaming about, when I happen to be sleeping, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of the councils.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct choice and reducing the number of representatives.
New York, with nine million inhabitants, has five districts and 51 deputies.
Prague with 1.2 million citizens has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor says she doesn't build enough and prepare big projects, but she doesn't have the authority.
The same goes for a government that only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
So I'm not saying they did it right.
But the current Prime Minister does not control anything, he only moderates the debate.
That can't work.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
He'd be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
In the program, we only have a change to a one-wheel election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate for ministers and a regulation of the House's Rules of Procedure in order to avoid unnecessary exposure of Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to be shown at House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are worried about.
That as a dictator you will manage the government, control the House with 101 MPs, cancel the Region and the Senate, and, through grateful mayors and mayors, you will rule the country.
I'm sure that's not true.
There is nothing wrong with us discussing the number of Members.
The French President Macron announced a third reduction in the legislative body, while there is 57,000 French in one legislator, while it is 17 thousand Czechs in our country.
However, Macrona is not accused of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic had won the majority election, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
However, it is enough to look at Poland or Hungary for those who have a parliamentary majority.
There is no risk of such a thing in the event of a NO movement.
We just need a team that'll work for people in the government, not for their crews or departments.
I don't understand, for example, why we couldn't agree on the fact that only teachers', cultural and social services employees' salaries would increase.
Why did they overrule me and add 21 percent to the GIBS, who are already taking 60,000?
Would you step on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency, and for the money of the state they would like to do business as Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in the government aren't supposed to argue, they're supposed to talk their way out of it.
There's got to be finished material in the cabinet, there's no room for coalition brawl, strong vote and business, there's no place to make a decision.
How do you want a coherent team when ministers act on the sidelines?
There's a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition treaty did not apply, and Babish went out of the government.
Any prime minister can do that.
But if she is a personality and she has the power to control, she doesn't need such false gestures.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you have any idea who you'd suggest to be the Minister of Finance?
I don't even think about it, we're not even gonna be in that government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
So much skepticism isn't in place.
The mayors have won the entrepreneur Grandpa, who would like to cooperate with you, and the folk may win the wing of the favored Jiří Čunk.
I don't think so.
ČSSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who is not excluded by the coalition with YES, and in ODS may be held by Václav Klaus ml., who will not also be opposed.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Deputy Prime Minister and Vice-President Yes Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with Tomia Okamura SPD, for example in the field of economics.
So the mercenaries come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, ran as the puppet of Vita Barta for the VV, then collected money from Dawn for his company, ran a coup there.
He is, of course, a prominent personality.
A bit brown, of course.
If I take his program, he's got a lot of people involved in company management, direct democracy, and that's okay with that.
That's not what I'm asking you.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, speaking at demonstrations with gallows and wanting to get out of the EU?
We don't think about working with Mr. Okamura, I can't imagine.
Clearly, he went into politics to benefit from it.
What about the silent support of the communists to your minority government?
I can't even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It'll be about negotiating the winner with the other in order, but God knows who's gonna be the winner and who's gonna be the two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government agenda.
Let's go back to your efforts to run the company.
But the government simply has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka had everything banished, never decided.
Coalities such as the ČEB or EGAP have not worked.
I mean, Saturday's his puppet, and I think that's why he fired me.
As soon as he did, ČEZ ruled the Czech government.
It is incredible that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by ČEZ management, which he imposes on the Minister of Finance, how he is to vote at the ČEZ General Meeting.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staffing conditions of the Supervisory Board and exchange CEZ top management?
Jesus Christ, if I'm gonna be the prime minister, we'll see each other.
I'm not one yet.
It is rumored that ČEZ has already sent out signals to you.
Good cooperation with ČSSD would like to exchange for even better with YES.
Well, maybe after the election, it'll all go on again.
I don't know anything about it.
I don't have any humble lobbyist or Pinkie, I'm a separate unit, and I don't deal with that at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to exchange the management of ČEZ, Czech Television or General Health Insurance, the institutions that you criticise?
I would like ČEZ to be a transparent society.
So far, you've been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
Just keep an eye on Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's supposed to stand in ČEZ Majority, he's never driven it, he's only been there in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ is supposed to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, do a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state is to fund and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech Television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don't, and I don't have any authority to fire anyone.
But to control yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay around 7.2 billion a year for public service broadcasting and television, but they don't really know how to manage these institutions.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look at the news being discussed, the super-power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which always worked.
This is true both of the current parliamentary commission for escapes from the investigation files and of lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousek push me out of the government, which took a percentage of TOP 09, but the ČSSD took them off.
They are afraid of disrupting their corruption system, and so they are talking about the threat to democracy by Babish.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President, Jaroslav Faltýnek, builds power facilities by adding his son to the Supervisory Board of Tepláren Brno and arranges contracts with urban and state-owned companies such as the Prague Transport Company or the Czech Railway?
That's a permanent dispute.
I don't like it, and I've regretted it a few times.
Faltinek argues that this lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, no Kratochwilova, Březina.
If there was any indication of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I'm uncompromising in this direction.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
