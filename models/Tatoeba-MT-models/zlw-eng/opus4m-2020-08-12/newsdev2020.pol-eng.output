Bosnia-Herzegovina protests against the plans of Croatia for radioactive waste disposal
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in north-west Bosnia to protest against the plans of neighbouring Croatia for the disposal of part of the waste from the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known for its natural beauty.
The demonstrators in the town of Novi Grad in Bosnia requested Croatia to abandon plans to build a landfill in the former military barracks in Trgovska Gora and declared a fight against the project.
The facility would store waste from the Krško nuclear power plant.
Bosniaians, holding banners with "I want a healthy future" and "Stop - (river) Una needs us", said that a radioactive waste dump could threaten the Union river and the lives of about 250 000 people.
We have to say no.
told the crowd Miroslav Drljaca, Mayor of Novi Grad.
We must fight to protect our way of life and our Una.
The Krško power plant, built in the 1980s, is also Croatia, located in Slovenia.
Representatives of both countries are due to meet next week to discuss the issue of additional landfills.
Croatian public television HRT stated on Friday that Croatia had not yet decided whether to build the landfill itself or to pay for the storage of parts of the waste in a new facility constructed by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told journalists that Croatia also has a problem with the disposal of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents on every side of the country of ethnic division insisted that Croatia find another location in part of the country closer to the power plant.
"Why is Croatia in the whole area saying that Trgovska Gora in Bosnia is the best place?" said Drljac.
We can't let them be humiliated!

American Congress agreed to sell 32 F-35 aircraft to Poland
The US Congress for 15 days after the Department of State approved a possible purchase by Poland of 32 multi-task fighters F-35 did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the purchase negotiations.
The Congress decision, although not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After accepting the sale by the State Department, and now by Congress, I see no major obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Councillor of the Washington Defence Policy, conservative think tank Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the 1976 Arms Export Control Act, a federal government, represented by the State Department, must notify Congress of any planned sale of weapons abroad 15 days before the signing of the contract, if the value of such transaction, in the case of sale of weapons to a NATO Member State, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed transaction for the purchase of 32 F-35 fighters by Poland is estimated at PLN 6.5 billion. This includes the costs of technical and logistics assistance, support equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 aircraft – if this transaction is finally completed – will be the American armament company Lockheed Martin, and its subcontractor is the engine manufacturer of the F-35A fighter company Pratt and Whitney.
In May, the Minister of Defence Mariusz Błaszczak submitted proposals for the purchase of American fifth generation F-35 fighters on behalf of the Polish authorities.
The Polish offer was discussed in June this year during the meeting of President Andrzej Duda with President Donald Trump in the White House.
This agreement will be implemented, if finalised, by representatives of the Pentagon within the framework of the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS programme, Poland has already acquired, among other things, the Patriot anti-missile system.
The price of one fighter F-35 at the time of Poland's offer of purchase was – without weapons and technical assistance – about 89.2 million dollars.
According to PAP, U.S. military experts who wanted to maintain their anonymity reported that the price given in the preliminary negotiations was "the maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"Prices are falling rapidly, currently the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars, much less than the cost of a Eurofighter, which has no advantages like the F-35," pointed out Venable.
PAP spokespersons expressed the hope that the final negotiations for the purchase of U.S. aircraft by Poland will be concluded this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – the offset – will be discussed directly with American manufacturers of F-35 fighters.
What is Münchhausen's replacement band, referred to in the series "Payton Lobart's Elections" on the Netflix platform?
Caregivers and parents with this disorder pretend that their healthy child is ill.
The Payton Hobart series will be held today on the Netflix platform.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States of America, but first he must become president of the student government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's show, the creators of American Horror Story and Glee, we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Platt and Lucy Boynton.
Without divulging too many details for those who have not yet seen the show, he deals with the topic of Münchhausen’s replacement syndrome – a mental illness occurring in carers who act as if a healthy person who is concerned with a physical or mental illness.
There are various types of this condition, e.g. Münchhausen syndrome, which consists in causing symptoms of the disease in question.
Münchhausen's replacement team is to simulate that the person under our care has certain ailments.
It is also called an imaginary and disease-induced disease, and is treated as violence against a child.
This is a rare condition, which usually involves a parent who exaggerates symptoms or causes symptoms, so that his child is ill.
What are the symptoms of Münchhausen's replacement syndrome?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS points to the following examples of behaviour:
Convincing medical personnel that a child who looks healthy, however, feels bad.
Exaggeration or invention of symptoms.
Forgery of results to make a child feel sick, such as giving glucose to urine samples, to make it look like a baby has diabetes.
Calling up symptoms of the disease, e.g. giving children unnecessary medicines and other substances.
How often is Münchhausen's replacement band?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases of disease are not reported.
A 2000 study indicates that over more than two years, 89 cases of this disorder occurred in 100,000 people.
What should be done if a child is suspected of being in danger?
Please contact the local Special Service department or call the NSPCC Child Protection Service Directorate by selecting the number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid at school in Kaduna, evacuation of 300 children
Kaduna – State Police Station in Kaduna yesterday raided Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma in Riga, Igabi District, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police said the children were under highly dehumanizing conditions, and the school authorities are denying that claim.
A resident claiming to be Shehu, a preacher at school, said: “They do not tell the truth because all the children were there with the consent of their parents.
Before the children were admitted to school, their parents signed the form.
Every day, parents brought food to their children and knew what conditions they were under.
We were astonished at the arrival of the police and the evacuation of children, as well as the removal of all the food the parents provided before school closed.
It's not fair, because parents can testify if their children are under bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Commissioner of the police Abdulrahman, who had visited the school to check the level of care for children, had never had reservations.
He said that the children were studying the Qur'an and nothing else.
However, a specialist in the Public Relations Police Station, Yakubu Sabo, concluded that after the transfer of the state of the children to the government, they would join their parents.
‘They were held under dehumanizing conditions on behalf of the submission or acquisition of knowledge of the Koran.
A lot of them had scars on their backs, which proves they were beaten.
That's why we're investigating the school to meet its owner," he added.
Foreign Talents Important for China's Development
Guangdong is a country leader in attracting foreign talents largely due to the Belt and Trail Initiative (BRI), the Gulf of Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Area (GBA) and the new Shenzhen role as a pilot demonstration area.
Nanfang Media Group interviewed seven expats from 10 to 70 years of age in Guangdong.
Born in Singapore, Yash, born in 2010 during the Asian Games in Guangzhou, he said he would like to realize his dream of becoming a scientist and doing a doctorate in Guangzhou.

She said that in her videos she would continue to share information about Chinese traditions, culture and technology.
Leticia de Lassus from France, head of JJB International Montessori AMI in Guangzhou, agrees that “the education of children is like wearing a jacket.
If you turn on the first button incorrectly, the rest will never go to the right place.
Henry Xiao, an American of Chinese origin, believes that at the very centre of the GBA, his company can enjoy many privileges in relation to new rules, government policies and capital resources, in particular talents.
The producer of the cooking program "Nanta Show" Sean Choi from South Korea said that Guangdong's cuisine is world-famous and the introduction of the "Nanta Show" program in Guangdong was a good decision.

On the question "Does the head of NIK Marian Banas think should resign", 55% replied "yes" – 34% indicated "deciding yes" and 21% "then yes".

The material shows that the head of the NIK was the owner of a building in Krakow, where the hotel was to operate for hours, and the leading gangsters were to rent a building for their business at a price lower than the market.
Following disclosure, Banas announced that on 27 September, he would go on a free holiday until the CBA had completed its review of the CBA's property claims.
The Kantar telephone survey was carried out on 25-26 September 2019 on a nationwide representative sample of 1005 people over 18 years of age.

Siemonia: Tusk or Kidawa-Błońska will be president
"I think Donald Tusk and Małgorzata Kidawa-Błońska have a chance to win the election with President Andrzej Duda," says Tomasz Siemoniak.
Deputy Head of the Civil Platform Tomasz Siemoniak spoke with Polsat News about the affair with the head of NIK.
‘This case is disqualifying for Marian Banas.
He can become a Minister of Culture from entertainment, not the head of NIK or the minister of finance.
Not someone who's responsible for billions, for taxes," he said.
"This is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Siemoniak also spoke about Claudia Jachira's candidacy.
“The lists of PiS include Antoni Macierewicz.
A man who didn't just say things, he did them.
He judged former SKW bosses of espionage for Russia, destroyed their lives, destroyed their families.
Why doesn't anyone ask Antoni Macierewicz not to be on the letters?" he asked.
"The younger people have a different aesthetics than us.
I think that Jachira, who has already apologized for one of the things, also feels that she sometimes exaggerates.
Let's not make this a campaign problem," he added.
Tourists after the crash of the travel agency Neckermann Poland planned to return to the country
As the office stated, so far it was not necessary to bring tourists before time.
"The Authority is gradually paying for unpaid hotel space from the insurance guarantee," is stated.
On 25 September, Neckermann Polska made a declaration of insolvency at the Marshal's Office.
At the time the office made a declaration of insolvency, there were 3600 tourists outside the country's borders.
On Wednesday, some 500 people returned to Poland, and on Thursday 230.
The next 350 people from Morocco, Spain and Greece are due to return on Friday.
Tourists will arrive in Katowice and Warsaw (totally five charter flights).
Some of them will return by cruise.
The weekend – as planned – should return to the country about 1000 tourists staying on holiday in Turkey, Egypt, Spain, Greece and Italy.
According to the information provided by the Marshal's Office of Mazowieckie Voivodship, the travel agency sold about 20 thousand tours for the autumn-winter season.
"These travel agents should contact the insurance company Allianz Partners directly," he reminded the office.
He added that "the situation of tourists who have signaled problems in hotels for the moment seems to be stabilised, and the emerging cases of extermination of tourists from hotels have been reconciled with consular services".
Last Friday, the authorities of the largest and the oldest travel agency, Thomas Cook, reported that it was on the verge of bankruptcy.
Thomas Cook GmbH owned 100% of the shares in Neckermann Poland.
The "ugly" masked Central Coast child rapist forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a masking suit, a man grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind and dragged her into a dense bush in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to a tree and raped her.
Soon after the arrest, a search warrant was executed at his house, where officers kept a number of items relevant to the investigation.
The man admitted guilty for the seven accusations of the attack and for the three others concerning the seduction and sexual exploitation of another girl, at the age of 11, between August 2016 and August 2017.
A 12-year-old victim walked through the path, and when she looked back, she saw him unexpectedly coming out of the bushes armed with a large branch and a knife.
When she begged "stop, stop, stop," he grabbed her neck and forced her to enter the plant.
The man said: “Silence, do not shout.
Don't shout, or I'll have to hurt you."
Holding a knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and legs with cable belts, and then tied her to a tree and raped her for almost an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man arrived at work around 9.30, not responding to a few text messages and calls from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and carried traces of grass and trees, and he himself claimed to have been involved in an accident involving an attack of rage on the road, during which he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off the sputter.
There will be a follow-up to the conviction of a man on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on the Executive Directors of Technology Companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Pope Francis warned the executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that the race to create artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievements involves the risk of increasing social inequalities if the common good is not taken into account in its ethical context.
Pope Francis gave these words during a conference in the Vatican, attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google companies, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of academics and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This three-day event is the latest proof that the Vatican is interested in taking part in the debate on the prospects and risks of artificial intelligence.
The technological achievements of war art and the future of work have been discussed, for which machinery will play an increasingly important role, as well as the study of the case of the investigation of the bombings in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the decisions taken by companies that own the social media in connection with the spread of the film recording the massacre.
During his speech at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that the machines at the beginning of the industrial revolution had saved workers dangerous and monotonous jobs.
However, he warned that increasing dependence on robotic devices to make profits would be a risk of depriving people of working dignity.
"If technological progress became the cause of increasingly visible inequalities, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If the so-called technological progress of mankind were to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an unwanted retroactiveity to some kind of barbarity dictated by the law of the strongest.
The conference organizers expressed their hope to use the expertise of the participants and to identify possible future Catholic advisors on high technology issues.
Martin Odegaard, a player on loan from Real Madrid, puts fans into euphoria with his impressive assistant.
Martin Odegaard noted an impressive assist at Mike Oyarzabal's opening goal.
By winning 2-0 with Osasuna, Real Madrid has climbed to the top of the La League table and continues the pass of being undefeated on its own field this year.
However, despite not one failure this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, it is under tremendous pressure as a result of the turbulent pre-season and public struggle with Welsh star Gareth Bale.
The situation reached a boiling point when Real Madrid was humiliated in the Champions League by Paris-Paint Germain (PSG).
Zinedine Zidane and Real Madrid, however, have real talents at their disposal – for some of them, the French currently have plans, for others not.
Vinicius Júnior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madrid and currently plays in the band.
However, the Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to Real Sociedad, caused great excitement, including an incredible assist in the La League match.
During the meeting Real Sociedad with Alaves Martin Odegaard performed an impressive assist at the opening goal of Mikela Oyarzabala and Real Sociedad finally won 3:0 in front of his own audience.
After removing the ball from the right-hand side, Martin Odegaard manipulated the player from the other team, putting on a net, and then sent him an amazing centimetre pass between two other players and his teammates.
The second goal of Willian Jose and the third one performed by the incredible Oyarzabal, this time with the penalty throw, provided a strong victory for Imanol's care before Manu Garcia was sent off the field five minutes before the game was over.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madrid only as a 16-year-old in 2015, but he had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel pretty confident on the field.
Anna Hazare surprised by the appearance of Sharad Pavara's name on fraud concerning Maharashtra's State Cooperative Bank
Anna Hazare said, "Sharad Pavara's name was not on the list when I was handed over to me."
The social worker, Anna Hazare, was not surprised by the fact that the name of Sharad Pavara, President of the Nationalist Congress Party, NCP, appeared in connection with a multi-million-dollar fraud in the State Cooperative Bank of Maharashtra.
The Executive Directorial Agency, in short ED, filed a case against Sharad Pavar, his nephew Ajit Pavar, former Deputy Minister of State of Maharashtra, and other persons in connection with fraud.
The information report of the Executive Director on the case, equivalent to the police report of the FIR, was submitted by the Central Agency under the Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on a report by the FIR of Mumbai police, which mentions the names of the former bank president Ajit Pavara and 70 former employees of financial institutions.
When the case came to me, Sharad Pavara's name was nowhere to be seen.
"How did his name come up, who gave it, only they know these things," said Anna Hazare on Thursday, when he was asked about the ED case and the alleged links between Sharad Pavar and fraud.
Anna Hazare, a critical judge of Sharad Pavar, expressed his hope that the truth would come out as a result of a detailed investigation into fraud conducted by ED.
"ED will find out where his name came from in the case," said Anna Hazare, a multiple participant in the anti-corruption demonstration.
Sharad Pawar denies the conduct of a criminal act and claims that he was in no way related to the bank, and also raises the question that the case was filed several weeks before the meeting's election in Maharash was scheduled for October 21st.
The former Minister of the Union assured that he would not fall under the majesty of Delhi, referring explicitly to a central government led by the BJP.
The NCP assessed the case of the Executive Director as being motivated by political considerations.
Working day SG.
Yesterday, several smugglers failed to export stolen items worth more than 130,000 zlotys to Ukraine.
All events were recorded yesterday (26 September) on the departure direction from Poland.
In Korczowa, a Romanian citizen carried an electric bike with a specialized electric drive.
In determining the legality of the origin of the item, the SG officers contacted the representatives of the German Police and quickly determined that the modern monogon worth about 10 thousand zlotys were stolen in the territory of the country.
A few hours later, also in Korczowa, border guards checking the trailer registered in France found interference in the VIN numbering field.
The driver of the truck kit was a Ukrainian citizen.

At the border crossing point in Medica, SG officers failed to export another stolen quad of Can-am (year 2019).
The value of the vehicle transported on the lavatory was estimated at PLN 75 thousand.
The driver of the set was a 32-year-old Ukrainian citizen.
The Border Guard confirmed that only two weeks ago, the quad was lost in Poland and is sought across Europe.
Medically, the "partial" sample of exports of the stolen vehicle was also undermined.
41-year-old Ukrainian traveling bus was carrying body parts from exclusive Mercedes.
All identification marks on the parts were mechanically removed.
The body parts worth about 15,000 zlotys were stopped.

Mylan agrees to pay $30 million under the EpiPen settlement
Mylan agreed to pay $30 million in a settlement related to the lack of investor notification of the investigation of the Department of Justice on the possible request for too high amounts in the Medicaid programme for EpiPen.
The Securities and Markets Committee concluded on Friday that Mylan NV qualified EpiPen for "generic" drugs in the Medicaid-return program.
Therefore, the pharmaceutical company provided the government with a significantly lower refund of part of the price of the product than in the case of the classification of EpiPen as a ‘mark medicine’.

Is this God's punishment?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysms, severe illness, child's death.
These are dramas that cause a great deal of suffering and it's hard to understand.
We say, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that "God wanted to."
Is it the Creator who sends us unhappiness and sickness?
John Paul II suffered greatly at the end of his life
When Nick Vujic was born 36 years ago, his dad ran out of the room with a fright.
"My son has no hands or legs!" he shouted to the doctor.
Parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that deprived them of limbs.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed and after four months Nick's mother felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, Vujic is a world-renowned evangelizer and motivational speaker, thanks to which many people are converted.
"I am proof that God is never wrong," stresses Nick.
“When suffering touches us, it’s hard to understand.
We're looking for a reason.
We ask, «Why did this happen to us?».
If we believe that God rules the whole world and directs our lives, naturally the question arises, whether He has sent a disease upon us, an unhappiness..."

I am practically convinced that each of you will be sentenced to several sentences of life imprisonment in due course."
The judge will determine whether this will be an absolute sentence without parole.
The verdict will take place on November 12th.
Member of the PO Krzysztof Brejz suing Caesar Gmyz
"In connection with the campaign of the lies of the spelling TV, I am suing Caesar Gmyz", said Mr Krzysztof Brejza on Twitter.
The reason for the lawsuit is the statement by the publicist Caesar Gmyz on TVP's "Follow 20" programme.
One of the leading leaders of SokemzBurac is Krzysztof Brejza, who has a great deal of experience in organizing the hate department.
“People who know Mariusz Kozak-Zagozda – the founder of the “hejter” profile – are Kierwiński, Budka and Giertych”, said Gmyz.
SokzBuraka are social sites and profiles with policy-related memes and jokes.
According to "Networks", the PR-sheep Mariusz Kozak-Zagona is behind this profile.
"We managed to find out that since April of this year Mariusz Kozak-Zagoda has been employed at the Warsaw City Office, in the marketing office", wrote the weekly.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police supervisory authority in connection with a close relationship with the businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The Independent Office for Police Procedures of the IOPC shall examine the possibility of initiating an investigation against the Prime Minister as to whether he has committed abuse as a criminal offence during the conduct of a public office as mayor of London.
The Council of Great London (GLA) made a statement that its Supervisor had registered the Prime Minister's "procedure issue" in connection with the accusations of Arcuri's preferential treatment resulting from their close knowledge.
"The question of "the case" can be referred to when information indicating the possibility of committing a crime appears," he said.
Doesn't mean that somehow it's been proven.
The IOPC will now consider whether this case needs to be examined.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of the police services in England and Wales.
She was transferred to this police oversight body because Johnson then held a position equivalent to that of the police commissioner and the criminal commissioner.
Johnson denied that any irregularities had occurred in connection with his close relationship with Arcuri.
He said earlier that he would follow the order of the London City Council and give details of his relationship with Arcuri, but insisted that the board would "focus on the wrong problem".
The order is a consequence of the report "The Sunday Times", that Arcuri, an American woman who moved to London seven years ago, received £126,000 from budget money, as well as privileged access to three foreign commercial missions, headed by the mayor of Johnson at that time.
As a result, the government has frozen a grant of £100,000 to Arcuri of Hacker House until the case is dealt with.
The government is waiting for some troublesome questions about the verification procedure carried out prior to the granting of the funds.
Minister for Digitisation Matt Warman said in the House of Communes that the staff of his department "usually maintained due diligence" and that the company had a British telephone number.
However, according to numerous reports, the call to the number was redirected to an office in California, where Arcuri is now to live.
The close relationship of the Prime Minister with the businesswoman "was a secret for the staff of the poszyniel".
The decision to refer the Prime Minister to the Independent Police Office of the IOPC was dissatisfactioned on 10 Downing Street.
According to a high-ranking source, the government represents a "politically motivated attack" and its term, on the eve of the Conservative Party conference, is "publicly political".
"The Supervisor did not provide any evidence to confirm the allegations, and the Prime Minister did not get a chance to respond before the press release was published late on Friday," the source claims.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to make such a public political settlement.
In earlier hours, journalists “The Standard” were told that Johnson’s close relationship with a businesswoman from California, assisted by the Agency for Tourism and Promotions in London, was “the secret of the polyszynel”.
The above-mentioned staff of London & Partners (L&P) recalled that Arcuri received seats during foreign business trips to Johnson as mayor, despite the fact that her companies were not considered "trustible".
The third person accused of drug offences in connection with Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – A third man was arrested and charged with drug offences due to the death of rapper Mac Miller last year.
According to the court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling counterfeit oxycodone pills treated with fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death in September last year as a result of accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a powerful opioid responsible for "epidemia", which consumed several thousand human lives in the United States.
Walter is accused of delivering pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed off on Tuesday reveal that Pettit received drugs from Walter all over August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, is suspected to be Walter's "currier" who delivered the pills to Pettit.
None of these men were directly accused of causing Miller's death, and none of them presented a line of defense in their case.
Walter, subject to parole in the 2005 drug case, is in custody and has been sentenced to five months for violation of the conditions of the release.
The prosecutors of the case, the first reported on Thursday’s website on TMZ celebrities, are demanding Walter to remain in custody pending trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of escape.
The answer to the message left on his lawyer's answering machine didn't come right away.
Pettis was charged in federal court on 4 September, and his attorney refused to comment.
The words of the rhymed works of Miller are an honest conversation about his depression and drug use, so he gained fans from the biggest hip-hop stars.
Born in Pittsburgh, Miller, whose real name was Malcolm James Myers McCormick, remained for two years in connection with the singer Ariana Grande, who finished earlier in 2018.
After his death on Instagram, she published a touching film with the participation of Miller and a song called "Thank U Next", in which she mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked to opioid abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of 3 Doors Down, also died of an overdose in 2016, and his body was found to have fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This article introduces a change: the correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates more than 30 mobile games
A 9-year-old creates a hidden play game using a free Scratch 2 programming application.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories in online or offline mode.
So far Basil has generated more than 30 games for mobile devices with it.
In today's game there is a bat that hides according to the program.
The player scores a point every time he catches a bat that leaves the safe house.
I learned how to create games on an accelerated course.
"Now I'm making them when I'm bored," said Basil CNN.
In March, Dad enrolled him for a five-day accelerated course for children aged 5 to 15.
The course, organized by Codefest International, aimed at providing children such as Basil with access to new technologies, such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, claims Basil played a lot of games on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always grabbed the phone and played it.
He played a lot at Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in creating games increased when he was 7 years old and got a storm for spending all his time playing games.
"One day he played on the tablet, as usual, and he was so absorbed in it that I got angry," said the father.
In anger, I said: “You’re still playing, can’t you think about creating your own games so that others can play them? ”
Speaking those words, I was upset, and I didn't think he'd take it seriously," he added.
Since then, Basil has shown an active interest in learning how to create his own games, encouraged parents to buy a laptop and save it to a course where he learned the basis for creating games.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, gives his thunder titles based on their content.
One of his games, "Mosquito mash", is available on Google Play Store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes leadership in innovation on the continent.
Recently, two Nigerian 12-year-olds were celebrated for using codes to create robots that separate their work at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the women's high school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robot cases.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its peers are on their way to a career of coding stars.
Former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit a lie about corruption
It is apparent from the documents filed on Friday that the former President of the Republican Party in North Carolina will admit to the court that he lied to federal agents investigating corruption in the main political donor.
According to Robin Hayes, he's going to plead guilty next Wednesday.
A document containing a factual basis, prepared in the context of a legal settlement signed by Hayes' lawyer, shows that Hayes knew that he was making a false statement to FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defense settlement has been sealed and, on the basis of the facts, there is no evidence that Hayes will plead to.
He was initially accused of conspiracy, corruption, and false testimony.
The prosecutors accused former Congressman Hayes of taking part in an insurance company's plan to direct contributions to the main insurance market regulator in the country in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and two of his associates were charged with attempting to bribe the state's insurance commissioner Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm, being one of the main state political donors in recent years, who has provided more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but also provided donations to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not reply to a request for comment on Friday's e-mail.
Hayes Kearns' defense attorney Davis did not reply to a request for comment on Friday's e-mail.
From the court documents filed on Friday, Hayes lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he didn't talk to Causey about employees of the State Department of Insurance.
In fact, according to a document containing the factual basis of Hayes, he spoke to the Commissioner for Insurance about Lindberg's request to change the staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg arrange a meeting with Causey and that he talked about a bribe directly with the regulator.
According to the April indictment, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance activities and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the re-camp of the Causey in 2020.
It follows from the indictment that the conciliation also included a request for a change in the official of the department which controlled Lindberg.
The former Republican Causey reported an alleged attempt to corrupt federal agents and helped them collect evidence on the case.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to the indictment, Lindberg's partner ordered Hayes to transfer $250,000 to the Causey campaign during a conversation where Lindberg and Causey were also present.
During the conversation Hayes initially protested, claiming that the transfer of such money would attract attention, but, according to the accusation, he finally gave way.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will," Hayes said, according to the indictment.
"All right, I'll take care of it."
The U.S. Attorney has not answered an e-mail asking for further information on the settlement.
Drivers will take the first episode of the new burial
The drivers from Saturday will be able to take advantage of the first of the three built mountain stretches of the S7 express road, the new Zakopianka – from the Skomielna Biała to Rabka Zdrój and the two-way main road accelerated to Chabówka.
On Friday, the spokesperson of the Kraków branch of the Directorate-General for National Roads and Motorways (GDDKiA) Iwona Mikrut reported, this is the first of three sections built S7 south of Krakow, from Lubnia to Rabki Zdroju, which will be put into operation.
From the 6 km section from the Kompelna Biała to Chabówka over one third, i.e. approx.
2.3 km, led on viaducts.
Seventeen of them arose, including the longest and highest, with a kilometer of length and 50 m high, and four small objects on the liquids at the Scompelna node.
From this node the slopes in Wadowice and Nowy Sącz, to the national road No.28 and to the old course of DK7.
From the next node, Zabornia, you can go to DK47 towards New Fair and Zakopane and DK7 to Chyżny and the state border with Slovakia.
On the Zdělecka Góra, the ILO's travel services were created.
The express road ends with the Zabornia node in Rabka Zdrój, which has been added about a kilometer of DK47 to the Chabówka, where it was included in the existing two-way Chabówka – Rdzawka.
S7 Scomielna Biała – Radka Zdrój and a new section of the 47th high-speed national road (GP) from Rabka Zdrój to Chabówka was built by the Italian company Salini Impregilo from Milan.
The investment cost amounted to approximately PLN 615 million.
The quality of the work carried out will be guaranteed for 10 years.
The 16.7 km fragment of the new Zakopianka, including 15.8 km with express road parameters, was divided into three implementation sections, each with a separate contractor: Lubień – Repair, Repair – Scomielna Biała and Scomielna Biała – Rabka Zdrój.
The first episode to enter the tunnel is performed by the Polish – Ukrainian consortium of companies: IDS-BUD S.A. from Warsaw and the Altis-HOLDING Corporation from Kiev, the Italian company Astaldi, and the third Italian company Salini.
The total cost of these tasks is almost PLN 2.5 billion.
The investment is co-financed from the European Union's Funds under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment 2014-2020.
The amount of funding is more than PLN 1.3 billion.
A total of 38 engineering facilities (bridges, viaducts, estakads) and a 2.06 km two-chamber tunnel are formed throughout this section.
According to the Road Manager's announcement this year, a 7.6 km section of Lubień will be made available – Repair with temporary inclusion in the old DK7, which the drivers will avoid building the tunnel.
Last episode, Repair – Scompelna Biała with a length of about 3 km, the drivers will drive in 2021, after the completion of the construction of a two-chamber tunnel with the length of each thread approx. 2.06 km.
Our goal is to make you rich.
"We are building a welfare state in Poland", said Zbigniew Ziobro, Minister of Justice.
He came to Szczecin to call for a vote for Councilman Dariusz Matecki, who is running for the Sejm on the list of Law and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the strategy of the Polish version of the state of prosperity", said the Minister.
"We want Poles to make much better money so that their lives are at a higher level.
This is necessary, because otherwise young, dynamic, well educated people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford it.
For four years, our government has consistently implemented a program that committed itself to doing four years ago.
We said we'd put in a 500-plus program.
The platform, Donald Tusk and Ewa Kopcz said it's impossible that the money just doesn't exist.
We proved that the money was and was, only the PO didn't care about the ones it was supposed to go to."
Ziobro also mentioned the trip for children and the 13th pension, and the fact that the 14th pension was also planned.
In addition to the smart distribution of national income, PiS priorities are a fair state and economic development.
The money should not go through a large stream only to the chosen pockets, who have good relations with the establishment and power, but should go evenly to the entire society," he said.

Facebook will hide your likes counter on trial with concern for user's well-being
As part of an experiment for the first time in the world, aimed at improving the user's well-being, some of the people using Facebook will soon not see a number of likes, reactions and video views under others' posts.
Likes will be hidden and visible only to the author of the post, and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test implemented on Instagram in July.
The new Facebook version launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, Director of Facebook Privacy in Australia, said that change is the result of a study on well-being and the opinion of mental health professionals showing that a fondness counter can lead to comparisons with others.
"The message from many of the groups working with us on the fight against harassment, as well as from mental health organisations, was really positive," Garlick said.
Eliminating this counter will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, rather than on the number of likes or reactions.
Sharing with others via the platform is expected to be more enjoyable and will not be seen as a rivalry, she said.
Garlick has ensured that companies based on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations to which they have had access.
She said it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as with Instagram, when the test was passed on to Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication when the experiment will be completed and whether the change will be made permanently.
"The initial user comments on the new rules in force on Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions" she said.
Speaking of the place of the world experiment, Garlick said Australia has very active, technically familiar Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an amazing country that will provide us with reliable opinions on whether or not new experience is of value to those who use our services.
Częstochowa: Councillors want compensation for pilgrims
The Częstochowa kuria has not yet commented on the appeal of the councillors to the local metropolitan abpa Wacława Depo for financial compensation for the handling of waste management during the pilgrimage season.
The city claims PLN 1 from the pilgrim.
He spoke about the metropolitan address on Friday at a press conference with the participation, among others, of the leader of the Spring Robert Biedronius, organized on the direction of Jasna Góra Częstochowa Avenue, Vice-President of the City Council and candidate for the Sejm Łukasz Kot.
The cat informed that the local councillor SLD voted to appeal to the abpa Wacław Depo to transfer one zloty from every visitor to the pilgrimage frequent – to support the work of urban, municipal services, etc.
We accepted an appeal to the Archbishop of Depo to help the city, help us clean up the pilgrims, prepare the city for pilgrims.
"Please transfer the zloty from every pilgrim to the budget of the symbolic city.
Thanks to this, the city will be able to provide them with better living conditions in Częstochowa", said the Vice-President of the City Council.
The Ombudsman of the Częstochowa Metropolitan Curia initially prepared a several-day response, but then asked, as he indicated, to replace it with information on the content: "Until we have received the official position of the City Council, we do not refer to the matter."
According to the project on the website of the Częstochowa Magistrate, the appeal to the abpa Depo concerns "transmitting financial compensation to the city of Częstochowa for the management of municipal waste during the period of the pilgrimage season".
"In view of the growing number of pilgrims arriving in Częstochowa and the increasing costs of handling the municipal waste management system during the pilgrimage season, in view of the image of the city amongst the residents, pilgrims and pilgrims, we wish, within the framework of the generally accepted canons, to take care of our common good, the small homeland of Częstochowa, to propose participation in the costs of handling the above-mentioned garbage system, to be a part of the appeal.
"In order to maintain the cleanliness of the pedestrian-traffic pipelines, while using a small infrastructure, i.e. external waste baskets, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of PLN 1 from the pilgrim", it is written.
"In addition, in connection with participation in the annual costs which the city will cover from its own resources, while ensuring cleanliness and aesthetics of urban space, and in order to emphasise that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the above amount will be used to improve tourist infrastructure, e.g. by increasing the number of public toilets available to the public," the Councillor declared.
They pointed out that, in addition to the financial issues, their proposal was based on the numerous reservations made by the residents regarding the state of purity of the routes by pilgrims.
"With a view to ensuring the cleanliness of our city and the most positive results of our cooperation, the Częstochowa City Council calls on the Archbishop of Częstochowa to transfer financial compensation to Częstochowa for the management of municipal waste during the period of the pilgrimage season," was repeated in the appeal.
According to the press office of Jasna Góra, there were 834,000 people taking part in 200 national pilgrimages to this sanctuary throughout the year.
Some 124 thousand believers arrived in 255 pedestrian pilgrimages.
More than 8.8 thousand people came to Częstochowa in cycling pilgrimages (133 groups), and 440 people (16 groups) in cross-country pilgrimages.
Less than 20 people reached the horse sanctuary and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups – on rollers.
"News" TVP missed the Confederacy when describing the survey
According to a poll by Pollster, 45% of the vote would be in the elections to the PiS Sejm, 26% KO, 14% Left, 7% PSL, and 5% Confederacy.
Even on the "Super Express" portal, for which the probe was conducted, the election threshold was even exceeded.
In the main issue of "News", describing the same survey, the results of the first four games were presented, completely excluding the Confederacy.
Edyta Lewandowska made it clear that only four committees crossed the electoral threshold and entered the Sejm.
The TVP viewers were also shown the division of the seats, without taking into account the votes cast on the Confederation.
It would give PiS self-government.
Krzysztof Bosak commented on this situation as a "public compromise on the issue of honesty towards society".
“They started with the slogans of the “moral revolution”, he recalled and stated that this matter was a sign of weakness.
Robert Winnicki, on Twitter, wrote that “”The TVP news” in subsequent actions against the Confederacy shame Urbana and Michnik”.
He also pointed out that there was no right-wing reaction from journalists.
“But let us also look at those who consent to remain silent.
The “righteous”, the “independent”, the “insubordinate”.
In a few years, they became a more primitive version of everything they said they had fought," he added.

Brother sentenced to life sentence for the murder of honorary social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became a star thanks to the photos published on social networks, was strangled in July 2016.
The brother of Pakistan’s social media star Qandeel Baloch was found guilty of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment as the loudest in this patriarchal country “honor killing”.
Baloch, who gained fame by publishing bold selfies – polite according to Western standards, but in strongly misogynistic Pakistan considered provocative – was strangled in July 2016.
She was arrested by Muhammad Waseem.
A few days later, during a press conference, he said that there was no remorse for his actions and declared that he “of course” murdered his sister and that her behavior was “not acceptable”.
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told AFP that the court in the western city of Multan found his client guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits) will be acquitted by the higher court," he said.
Before that, Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, told AFP that she had hoped that her son would be acquitted.
‘He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and this is my son," she said.
Baloch's murder was at the forefront of global information services and renewed calls for action against the epidemic of the so-called honor killings in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking patriarchal social principles.
Women were set on fire, strangled, shot or daggered for such crimes as choosing their own husband or, as in Baloch's case, for bringing their family to shame through the manifestation of their own sexuality.
Murders are usually committed by a close relative.
Under Pakistan's Qisas law (blood money) and Diyat (retaliation) they may ask the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after Baloch's murder, Parliament adopted new legislation imposing a life sentence for honorary murders.
However, if a murder is considered an honorable crime remains the responsibility of a judge, which means that murderers can theoretically refer to another motive and be acquitted.
In Baloch’s case, her parents initially pressured her son not to be favored.
However, the devastated think that they may lose him too, change their minds, and declare that they want him to be acquitted.
The international indignation caused by the murder led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and declare itself to its heir along with its parents, thus forcing the matter to move forward.
One of Baloch's best-known achievements is to offer a striptease before a Pakistani cricket team and to put on a reddish purple dress on Valentine's Day.
She was criticised and threatened, but many people, including young people, saw her as a breaking limit in a country where posing as a Kim Kardashian-like character can be regarded as a bold and political movement to strengthen women.
The roots of "glorious" killing lie in tribal social standards, which still dominate in South Asia, and in particular normalize women's behaviour, although men can also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced from northwest Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the UN reported that the increasing violence has doubled the number of people resettled from northwest Nigeria to around 40,000 people in the last four months.
The UN Agency for Refugees concluded that the concerns have created a "new emergency humanitarian situation", which requires interagency efforts to raise new funds of $35,5 million by the end of the year.
Babar Baloch, the spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group Boko Haram, which has been leading the uprising in the north for decades, has not been responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfar and Katsina observed over the last 10 months is rather the result of the activities of organised armed groups.
"This paints a frightening picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told the journalists on Friday.
He reported frequent reports of kidnappings, tortures, extortions, murders, and sexual assaults by the attackers who also destroy houses and steal cattle.
Military and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the military is towed from the fights against Boko Haram and the branch office of the Islamic State in West Africa, which separated from its former group in 2016.
"The refugees do not come with the names of the groupings," he said.
They come for it with terrible stories.
Most refugees get to the neighbouring Niger.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that he expected more people to flee to Niger in the coming months, along with the worsening security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for the trial of a man accused of killing a woman and 2 children
A new court date was scheduled for a Guatemalan male accused of killing an Iowa State apartment and its two children.
According to the Act of the District Court in Polk County, it appears that 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellana is accused of three first-degree murders under a false name that the police originally gave: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't plead guilty.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores-Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter, and her 5-year-old son on July 16 at their home in Des Moines.
It follows from the case file that the new date of the hearing, i.e. 27 January, will give representatives of both parties more time to prepare.
U.S. Immigration and Customs officers claim that Escobar-Orellana is staying illegally in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was convicted of entering the United States illegally.
“The Sun”: Boris Johnson, in the face of a rebellion in the face of a desire to reduce the demands of Brussels and to reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
Just three weeks before the final summit of EU leaders among the most important people in the Prime Minister's environment, there are growing concerns that it will not be enough time to achieve major concessions.
Boris Johnson is faced with the risk of rebellion from the office wanting to reduce the demand for brixit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
Negotiations were followed by a deadlock on the new customs system, which would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, as Brussels has identified the proposals for other arrangements offered by Johnson as "unfeasible".
The Ministers of the Crown expect EU decision-makers, led by German head Angela Merkel, to offer the last minute a compromise to the criticised tory leader in the form of a three-year backstop limit.
Journalists "The Sun" spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual Tory Conference next week in Manchester.
They will demand the Prime Minister to reject the "aggressive" strategy developed by his close adviser, Dominika Cummings, attempting to use the bluff against the EU and threatening to leave the Union without a contract, and then to accept the offer made by the Union at the last minute.
One of the cabinet ministers identified the daunting verdict of the Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday on the termination of the suspension of Parliament as "a warning signal" and added: "The only way for us to leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of an agreement.
We will never overcome the arithmetic in the House of Communes, which acts on our advantage.
The Prime Minister must bend now and accept what he is able to receive.
Aggression doesn't pay: it's obvious that Cummings' plan burned on a pan.
We can't fight so many fronts.
The second Minister of the Office has committed himself to hand Johnson over to try to push through the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresa May if everything else fails.
The Minister said: "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to reintroduce the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the House of Communes."
There are chances of voting her, and everyone really wants to finish this subject.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
The former minister for tories said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants agreements with the European Union.
However, we do not see him sitting in Brussels working on it.
Instead, he fights with bulls in Scotland, checks his balls in Wales, and fights with citizens on the main streets of cities – everything in the eyes of the world, as if an election campaign had been going on for good."
Yesterday, the spokesman of the current Prime Minister admitted that the agreement was still remote, and he added: "No one should have any illusions: a very long way to make an agreement."
However, the Ombudsman also said that Benn's law implementing the postponement of brixit by three months in the event of failure to reach an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this bill is making it difficult for us to negotiate, but, despite it, the Prime Minister and his colleagues are still trying to make progress through hard work."
The Brussels Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where more talks will take place with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a paper on how the zone works for all of Ireland for food and live.
A dog with no nose and legs conquers Instagram.
Perfectly impeccable
Pussy was supposed to be put to sleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transported from Romania to the UK by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
The photo of the dog was posted on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with an animal at first sight.
"At first, I had difficulty convincing my husband to adopt, because we had already had three dogs," she said.
A woman decided to take care of a bitch until someone didn't adopt her.
Still, no one's volunteered.
“The fact that no one wanted her made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," she told Kate.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly impeccable.
We love her as she is, and if anyone doesn't like how she looks, that's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie became a social media star over time.
In Instagram, over 14,000 Internet users are watching her.
Lorraine Kelly: It was said that with a Glasgow accent I would never make a career on television
According to Lorraine Kelly, the TV bosses said that due to the accent from Glasgow, "he will never make a career" as a presenter.
Speaking of her 35-year-old career in the television industry, Kelly, 59 years old, admitted that before her first performance on the screen, she felt "a lot of nervousness".
"I was only 25 years old and I was very nervous," she said.
When I was working at BBC Scotland as a search and checking specialist, the chief of bosses said that because of my Glasgow accent, I would never be successful on TV.
I went to London to get to know the whole TV band and watch the show before I took up my duties at the Glasgow office.
I'll never forget an interview with Bette Davis star Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a living legend.
I knew this was what I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became Scottish TV correspondent in 1984, she began her career as a reporter of a local newspaper in East Kibride, Scotland.
She then started running programs such as GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak, and later started with her morning program "Lorraine", which was named after her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career will celebrate a special program during which she will remember her best remembered moments and interviews.
The presenter said that the secret of her long television internship is "passion and enthusiasm" and "interest", adding: "It must be hard to work.
To be honest and authentic.
Prepare for programmes and be both interested and interesting.
When she mentions the media reports that touched her emotions, Kelly reveals that "very difficult" for her was reporting the bombing in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families killed or wounded children watched our live show with Dunblane the day after the terrible murder of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we spoke at her house for many hours.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since Joanna's funeral, which I attended.
She added that "extremely difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCanna shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "she really admires their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain, because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and they also have to bear the most horrible comments from online trolls.
I'm with them with all my heart.
The programme for the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work on TV will start at 8:30 p.m. on Monday, 30 September at ITV station.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of being imprisoned
A senior government official claimed that Vice President Constantino Chiweng had rejected the bid to take over President Robert Mugabe's office at the summit because he was afraid of being imprisoned in order to confirm the acquisition of power by the military in November 2017.
As reported last week by "The Zimbabwe Independent", Mugabe offered Vice President Chiwenga the presidency during the negotiations with the military during the coup.
However, a senior government official in the social media stated that Chiweng did not reject the offer out of fear, but because he had reviewed Mugabe's plan to prove to the world's leaders and the African Union (AU) that he had actually lost during the coup.
On the Twitter portal, which confirmed that the 37-year-old ruler of Zimbabwe wanted to transfer power to Vice President Chiwenga rather than to President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, on which the state officials confirmed that he was a senior civil servant at the President's Office and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that there were intense negotiations at that time.
State officials claimed that Mugabe contacted Chiwenga through one of his envoys when he realized that power was getting out of his hands.
Mediations between military authorities and the deceased ex-president were, according to the higher-ranking state official, three stages.
The official claimed that President George Charamba, the spokesman of the negotiations, was the head of the Central Organization of Intelligence Aaron Nheper and the priest representing Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
The former head of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, has been another element since Mugabe sent him with a one-man mission to transfer the offer to the President of Chiwenga, who was the head of the Zimbabwean Defence Force (SOZ).
After his death, a man who was even more regarded as an African icon than as a life, in vain tried to obtain condemnation from the UA of military action, trying to get other African leaders to intervene.
The President's offer, made by the deceased (Mugabe) to the Chief of Defense (SSO) of Chiwenga, was not the result of choice.
“It was a desperate act to save a situation that took a dangerously rapid pace by removing part of the deceased’s family,” writes an official (Jamwanda).
But there was also a bit of political temptation with which the dead wanted to reverse the situation in a completely non-scientific way.
It is enough to recall that the commanders have declared that they have not overthrown and overthrown the constitutional order, which would cause their conflict with the AU's position on the coups.
The deceased (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chiweng) would swallow the bait, violently interrupting the claims of the leaders that they had not overthrown the constitutional order.
The hope for the deceased (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, by the way, was still highly confused about the situation and how to fit it into its theoretical taxonomy of overturns, would then have no choice but to describe it as a coup, and therefore a call for military intervention would have been credible.
It was in such a spirit that this offer was made.
Officials claimed that Mugabe had made this move when he realized that the defense forces had no longer demonstrated their readiness to protect him.
They said Mugabe was forced to sign a letter of resignation after warning the mighty man that he was risking Gaddafi-like lynching.
The chiefs of the army told him they wouldn't turn their guns on the citizens if they went to his residence, Blue Roof.
And at the same time Mugabe had two desires, i.e. to save his family and to prove that the army had taken over", added the official.
The then SSO and the commanders read the assumptions correctly.
The messenger (Gono) who transfers this desperate message was given to understand – through a powerful metaphor – that isu tiri vemakwapa-makwapa (we belong to the Camouflage sect, i.e. the military), we are neither politicians nor we compete with each other at the political level, claimed the higher rank of a state official.
State officials say that the military has notified military commanders in the area through the attaché who were in Zimbabwe that they are not going to overthrow Mugabe, but to deal with the surrounding "criminals".
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to reinvent Mnangagwa to return from a short exile in South Africa so that they could talk about turning and succeeding.
In addition to the negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The people of South Africa, which is a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because then President Jacob Zuma was President of Sadc – refused to intervene, but clearly indicated that if the military invaded the Mugabe house, as repeatedly feared in the background, the army of South Africa would immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work, because Putin and the African leaders didn't choose this route," said the Independent.
China needs strong leadership or will “break apart” as stated in the policy document
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, as otherwise the country will “fall apart” – said the government in a policy paper issued on Friday on the eve of the 70th anniversary of the creation of the People’s Republic.
The Chinese government’s press office reported in the White Paper that the country’s successes since the Communists took over 70 years ago have moved into the leadership of the party.
China has a large area and has complex national conditions, and the administrative difficulties are rarely seen here.
The document mentions that without China's uniform and strong leadership, China will move towards division and dissolution, which will be catastrophic to the world.
The Chinese authorities have long used a hard-armed policy to address the problems, as in the case of the suppression of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, justifying the need to maintain the country's stability.
President Xi Jinping, who will be at the forefront of the second-largest anniversary of the world economy on Tuesday, has, since the end of 2012, strengthened the party's governments and imposed sanctions on those who may question power.
Xi is also overseeing the military modernisation programme that struck the region out of balance.
The paper states that China is not trying to export its development model, nor is it willing to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, not "hegemony".
The Chinese don't have the genes to conquer other nations or dominate the world.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by great powers, and wars and unrest have put a deep mark on them as a result of the sufferings it has suffered; China will never cause others to suffer.
China celebrates this anniversary in uncertain times for a country involved in a bitter trade war against the United States and facing challenges due to a slowing economy, as well as anti-government protests in China’s submissive Hong Kong.
The document says that China will never "sold" its most important interests or allow something to harm their sovereignty.
With regard to the trade dispute between the country and Washington, the document states that "the dangers of trade wars and further increases in customs tariffs do not lead to problems being solved".
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a wide marketplace and a strong pace of economic development.
The paper adds that "commercial wars will never weaken it".
China is confident that it is able to face difficulties, to turn the crisis into new opportunities and to open up a new world.
It was also added that the United States should take a reasonable look at China's development because China does not intend to question the position of the United States or to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely to halt China's development.
Reducing and weakening other countries and communicating national misunderstandings abroad will not give the United States a strong position.
The World of Jack Pałkiewicz: Dubai, the real face
Dubai is a place still seeking its own identity, torn between Bedouin tradition, Islamic religious radicalism and progressive extremism.
This trendy new world tourism leader stimulates imagination and desire, gnawing the futility of wealthy snobby hotels and attracting investors and traders looking for fortunes as a tax haven.
The websites are infecting with enthusiasm for this city of dreams, which is an exciting temple of luxury and concentrated architecture of the 21st century in one.
They were built on oil-rich sands and became Eden for those who love the rest, five-star hotels, beautiful weather and pools hundreds of meters above the ground.
Many are delighted with the ubiquitous, creative hyperactiveism and a hysterical pursuit of avant-garde.
Here is a city whose motto says all: "surprise, stunn and charm."
And almost every step of the way.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling them a city without character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the full extremes and contradictions of the metropolis have taken on the dimension of the cheap grotesque.”
It became a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, an unofficial constitution.
Because everything here must be bigger and prettier than anywhere else in the world.
However, among the density of excesses and ostensible remains, there is a lack of something that may be less transparent in old Europe, but is important for quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like at home.
And in Dubai, I'm sure you don't.
Running away from the world of magic, I ripped off his golden mask, revealing the other face of an artificial paradise.
A face you don't talk about loudly and you don't write.
I show the poverty of Asians contrasting with the fairy tales of the divine ethnic caste of Dubai, the grandchildren of the illiterate Bedouins.
I run into extreme poverty, such as the ghetto on the outskirts of the city, where there is an army of Asian workers under cruel conditions.
It was they who built the desert of Manhattan under slave conditions in one generation.
They came here guided by good wages and the ability to ensure a decent life for their families, and they found a nightmare.
He'll never see this tourist because it could blow up into the air created by Dubai's myth for years.
The increasing criticism of the international community makes the subject of cheap labour highly troublesome to the emira.
Mel C of Spice Girls banned in her home dietary conversations after her struggle with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm, from Spice Girls, admitted that there's a diet ban in her house after she struggled with eating disorders herself, eating only fruit and vegetables for years.
For years, Spice did not eat and “obsessively practiced” as a result of the pressures of being a famous member of the pop group worldwide, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
Today, she reveals that her experiences affect Scarlet’s way of raising her daughter, so she “does not allow diets to be spoken of in her home.”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I am beginning to see that she is more aware of her appearance," Mel said.
"I believe that one of the positive experiences of eating disorders is that I am very aware of how I speak with her.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for Women's Health Mel magazine, who won fame in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls band, she said that in the days before the social media were involved in the press "disturbing" comments about it caused complexes.
"I began to look at myself in an inappropriate way, giving up certain groups of food products, practicing increasingly obsessively, until I became underweight," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A Photo That Shakes the World
The Polish girl and the American documentary have given a witness to the world about the atrocity of war.
Legendary picture of Julien Bryan can be seen in the World War II Museum in Gdańsk
"Listen to my story.
I speak from the besieged city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish nation about what happened here.
America must act, it must help!", began his radio documentary speech, photographer Julien Bryan.
On the tragic September 1939 he was in the capital of Poland, seeing the drama of the bombarded city and its inhabitants.
His account reflected a broad echo in the West.
The president of Warsaw Stefan Starzynski first helped him, borrowed his car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a suicide note to his family in the U.S., deposited it in the embassy safe and... stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be wherever the Warsawers were.
400 planes and artillery almost non-stop attacked the city.
Bryan's death, suffering, and the struggle to survive in the city's continuums.
Right before the surrender, he and the embassy's employees took the negatives out of the ocean.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What happened to Warsaw will happen to Paris, London, and even New York. ”
His shocking chronicles were seen by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the US began to prepare for war.
“Daddy showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They made films that praise their chivalry.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, Julien's son.
Courts of the jury against a former athlete accused of multiple rapes
There's a trial in front of the jury about the rape of a former baseball team at Delaware University, who's accused of multiple sexual assaults.
On Friday, after 10 days of testifying and hearing arguments, the jury members proceeded to settle the fate of 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman of 21 years of age claims that Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after these two people had made contact on the website of Bumble meetings and sent the woman a picture of him naked.
The woman is one of the six accused Conaway of sexual assault between 2013 and 2018.
According to the prosecutors, the hugging that a woman agreed to turned herself into a rape, which was opposed to her.
Defenders refer to conflicting relationships between a woman and a gap in memory and claim that a woman probably regretted that an intimate approach had occurred.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for one million zlotys
The gold-covered bike worth a million zlotys could be seen in the anniversary, the 10th edition of the International Bike Fair Kielce BIKE-EXPO.
This is an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His constructor, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowicz has just received a bicycle Oscar at the Las Vegas's World Fair of Custom Bikes.
- The bike is covered with gold spray chrome, under which is the highest silver test.
It's an unusual coating made by a friend of mine from Żor.
"There is a saddle, there are pedals, there is a steering wheel, you could normally drive it.
It can develop a speed of 50 kilometers an hour.
It's an electric bike," says his designer.
‘Bike career was printed on a 3D printer.
They're cubes that form a kind of vortex.
I came up with the idea of this model driving my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and hid it deep in the drawer.
The sketch waited five years to be implemented.
The bike itself was built for three years", adds Adam Zdanowicz.
"It was cruelly difficult to hide all the elements under the bodywork.
There are batteries, wires, components that form the structure inside.
It is hidden under the body removed in 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
That's where the engine's hidden.
The bike driver was set up a week before I left for the United States at the World Bike Show.
I couldn't really decide what the steering wheel was.
She's made up of transportation.
The bike weighs 90 kilograms," summarizes.
The gold-covered bike was appreciated in Las Vegas by the most important competition category "Best amazing single custom copy".
The film shows a strong contamination of popular tourist destinations
Sydney Bay, surrounded by an opera building, a port of Circular Quay, Luna Park theme park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge, makes an important contribution to the $21.9 billion annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But there's an ugly truth under the bridge.
The famous Sydney Bay is one of the most contaminated waterways in the country, to which the volume of pollution affects each year equal to about 15 Olympic pools.
These scary statistics make one of our biggest tourist assets one of our dirtyest aquariums at the same time.
According to the new film material entitled "Sydney Bay – on the top and below", the waters in the vicinity of Australia's most popular city are full of slides, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all of which flow into the bay along with rainwater.
However, the largest component of our shipping channels is plastic.
“I would call it a paradox,” says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, Deputy Director of the Research Program Sydney Harbour Research Program, with the publication of this film deliberately converging with the World Tourism Day.
This water looks beautiful, but it is one of the most changed and contaminated estuaries along our coastline.
CSIRO estimates that about 1560 kg of plastic enters our waterways every hour, and most of it affects the bay through storm sewerage.
"After so much rainfall... it looks quite tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rainwater.
However, as in the case of the iceberg, the problem with Sydney’s bay is much more serious below water surface, as 70% of the plastic that enters the ocean goes to the bottom of the sea.
"In my opinion, unless you spend time underwater, you cannot really realize what is in there," said Richard Nicholls, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team are pulling about 500 kg of plastic out of the water each year.
I think that if more people knew (what is under water), they would just be scared.
It's overwhelming... more than half of what we find on the bottom is plastic nets.
The other 50% are things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the bay, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that we're bringing all this plastic out and all the other trash right below the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and managing director of Ocean Protect, said that there are ways in which people – both local and tourist – could help reduce the amount of plastic and remains that enter our waterways.
"This must begin at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic we use, improve the recovery of materials and be more aware of what we drain in the sewers that eventually reach the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we will be destroyed because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It absorbs 30% of carbon dioxide and our source of food.
But we can sort this cove and bring it back to its former glory, and it's very simple.
If we kill our oceans, we kill ourselves too.
The film material financed by the recycling company TOMRA in its wider efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and to reduce the negative impact of the containers on beverages that often enter the environment coincides with a study on the relationship between plastics and mental health, the results of which were published this month.
A new survey of 546 children from 12 to 18 years of age found that 82% of respondents felt vulnerable to plastic waste and 25% of adult guilt for waste from disposable plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic waste was also the fourth biggest concern for parents, and 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said that their concerns about the amount of plastic waste entering the oceans were growing.
Many people who took part in the study said that they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes, which led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memes after the volleyball game in the semi-final ME
It wasn't an easy match.
The Slovenians had a natural audience on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish volleyballers.
A lot of controversy was also raised by judges who in one of the shares did not count the four reflections on the host side.
It happened at the crucial moment of the first set, when Vitala Heynen's subordinates had a chance to jump off rivals and win the first game.
However, this was not the case, and the Poles eventually had to recognise the superiority of the rival, who, after winning 3:1 will play the finals of the tournament.
Ghana: Kaneshi merchants support the Akra psychiatric hospital
The members of the Kaneshie Market Association donated food worth 30,000 GH yesterday? A psychiatric hospital in the Akra during a short ceremony held in Akra.
This is part of the event of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.
The donations included various food products, fruits, soft drinks, biscuits, clothing, soups, tomato bananas, manioc and water bags.
During the visit, the group also talked to several patients of the facility.
The event was attended by members of the management staff of the Accra Markets Limited, the directors of the association and the queens of the mother.
Presenting the subjects, Ms Mercy Naa Africa Needjan, President of the Women's Association of the Great Aqua Region Market, announced that donations are part of the regular activities of the charity group under social responsibility.
She noted that supporting the care of the patients of the facility was necessary to show love and to allow them to feel part of the society.
Mrs Needjan promised the hospital support from the association and called on other associations to follow this gesture.
Taking gifts, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, the hospital director, praised the association for its support and promised that it would be used well for the benefit of the patients.
She called on other organizations to support the hospital.
Google creates a cloud in Poland.
Partner of PKO BP
The operator of the National Clouds, PKO BP and PFR, entered into a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation is intended to help Polish companies implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open the so-called Google Cloud region in Warsaw – i.e. the hub of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the region of Central and Eastern Europe.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global computing cloud installation in Central Europe.
The digitization of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions behind the project of the creation of the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Polska and by the Polish Development Fund, the shareholders of the company.
The Partnership of National Clouds and Google is another important step on the road that we set up less than a year ago, declaring the appointment of the National Cloud Operator.
The goal remains unchanged – digitisation of the Polish economy and dynamic growth.
"Now Polish companies will gain additional, sophisticated tools for its implementation.
Using them, they increase their chances of getting promoted to the World League, which we all care about.
The fact that Google is joining them today is indeed strengthening our joint project", says Zbigniew Jagiełło, President of Polish Bank PKO.
The Polish Development Fund points out that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
"The investment in the National Cloud Operator is perfectly integrated into the PFR strategy as an important element of the country's digitisation.
It will provide entrepreneurs with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and will attract the best specialists to it", adds Paweł Boris, President of the FRR.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all the key Google Cloud Platform products such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the National Cloud will enable Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies that their global competitors use.
Thanks to us, however, they will remain in the Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators", notes Michał Potoczek, President of the National Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrendes, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), which repeatedly increase the need for computing power needed to process huge data sets.
VI The General Parade of Seniors
At noon, 24 August 2019, at Ronda de Gaulle in Warsaw, the VI Parade of the Seniors "Matured Magnificents" and the Piknik of the Generations, events organized by the Foundation of Origins began.
According to Przemysław Wiśniewski of the Foundation: “The company is a worldwide event.
She has already passed through the centre of Warsaw for the sixth time to manifest what a large and diverse community the seniors are.
Through the Parade we prevent harmful stereotypes affecting the elderly and call for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was led by a special underground coach serving as a musical mobile scene, on which the famous Warsaw DJ Wika traditionally appeared.
The participants in the joyful corvod, at the second known Warsaw and world beats, went through the Jerusalem Alejami, Kruża Street to the Warsaw Uprising Square, Mazowiecka Street to J. Piłsudski Square, and Królska Street and Krakow Předměstí on the Main Campus of the Warsaw University.
During the march, which was attended by several thousand seniors representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, the colorful delegations were greeted with applause by numerous tourists gathered on the route of the march, Warsawers and tourists.
Two organized groups in the company's yellow and blue T-shirts took part in the parade.
The first to represent the University of III of the Age and Senior+ Club and the second to be called SAGA, the Senior Active Animator Group.
At the University Campus, the organizers prepared, among others, gastronomic stalls and numerous stands of institutions and companies offering senior services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
There were medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashion stands.

Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may have the key to treating cancer – researchers have made a breakthrough discovery that can revolutionize therapy for patients
Medical researchers have discovered how to mask some cancer cells
The researchers found that the same process is happening to the Tasmanian devils and humans.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new treatments for cancer patients
What do Tasmanian devils and humans have in common?
Cancer cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have made a breakthrough discovery that can help revolutionize the therapy of some cancers if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain the key to treating fatal facial tumours that threaten the future of the Tasmanian Devil.
The study established a way to mask some cancer cells in both humans and cysts, using a group of proteins called PRC2, which shuts off a marker that would otherwise give a signal to the immune system to attack the cancer.
This may represent the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma and skin cancer, called Merkel cell carcinoma.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop immune resistance, we can be able to reverse this process", said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapy can be directed towards the reintegration of markers, proteins called MHC, allowing the immune system to recognise cancer cells.
" Potentially this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
"This is one of the most common diseases on earth.
Or maybe we can treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will someday be used to treat Tasmanian Devil's facial tumours, where cancer cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is unusual that exactly the same process occurs (in the case of cancers in humans and in Tasmanian devils)", said Professor Dawson.
"So far it has been very difficult to treat Tasmanian diabetic tumours.
But if medicines that work in humans can also be used in Tasmanian devils, it is possible that this will help control the disease."
Scientists astonished at the fact that a very small star is circling a very large planet
Scientists express their surprise at the discovery of a solar system located 30 light years from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of planetary formation, because in this system a large planet similar to Jupiter is circling a small star called the Red Dwarf.
Artistic illustration of a gas-type planet with a giant GJ 3512b orbiting a central star, a red dwarf, published on 26 September 2019.
Generally, stars are much larger than even the largest planets around them.
However, according to scientists on Thursday, in this case, the star and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of a star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the sun, while the mass of the planet that orbits it is at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"Yes, it is an absolute surprise," said Astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales, from the Catalan Institute for Space Research, at the Spanish Institute for Space Research, who headed the research published in Science.
The discovery is surprising because theoretical models of solar system formation suggest that low-weight stars usually become parent stars for smaller planets like the Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a gas-type planet a giant like Jupiter circling a very small star," added Morales.
This planet, like Jupiter, consists mainly of gas, was discovered using a telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory in Spain.
It orbits its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full lap lasts 204 days.
Red dwarfs are small and have a relatively low surface temperature.
The star GJ 3512 is not only much smaller than the sun, but to some extent it is comparable to the size of a very large planet, because it is only about 35% larger than Jupiter.
They emit less energy, so they are paler than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is approximately below 3800 (degree) Kelvina (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Fahrenheit).
"That's why they have reddish colour," said Morales.
"There is evidence of the existence of a second planet currently orbiting this star, while a third planet could have been thrown out of the star system in the past, which could explain the elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jupiter," said Morales.
Planets are formed from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that gives birth to a star around which the planets orbit.
According to the leading model of the formation of planets called the acreage model, the object initially arises from particles in the disk, and the force of the planet's gravity in the early stage of development allows the atmosphere to arise from surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called gravitational instability.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around a young star can be a little more massive than we expect and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a difficulty in disk stability, so there may be some denser areas.
These masses can grow until the planet collapses and forms.
A delicacy worker accused of serving a co-worker of bean dip containing methamphetamine
The Sheriff's office in Marion County kept Cassandra Medina-Hernandez, 38 years old, for serving a co-worker of a bean dip containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, a 38-year-old from Albany Cassandra An Medina-Hernandez was accused of delivering methamphetamine and causing the consumption of this substance controlled by another person – both crimes are second-degree crimes.
The charge was made on the basis of the event of 9 September at the Thriftway grocery store in Jefferson.
In a statement made under oath by OregonLive.com, which points to the likelihood of guilt of a 27-year-old female suspect, she told the Deputy Sheriff of Marion County that she saw Medina-Hernandez making a beans dip during a lunch break, and then she offered it to her.
Based on the statement, it is known that the crime victim, who according to what she provided to the investigator, never took methamphetamine, said that "she thought that one piece eaten by her tasted strange, but it did not raise any suspicions."
When she got back to work, she felt like she had a stomach upset and couldn't stop.
According to Albany Democrat-Herald, she went to a local hospital where it was found that the beans dip could contain methamphetamine.
According to reports from The Smoking Gun, a police officer on the Thriftway network said that Medina-Hernandez “said she would add drugs to food,” while another one admitted that the suspect sent her a message claiming that methamphetamine was accidentally put into the beans dip.
The OregonLive website reports on the recording from the delicacy monitoring, which allegedly shows how the back-viewed Medina-Hernandez camera extracts something from the bra, stands behind the microwave and leans.
Then it straightens, wipes its nose, comes to the table, and puts a dip of beans in a small paper vessel.
According to the police, the thing she pulled from her bra was probably on the plate.
Oregon's Stateman-Journal reports that the sheriff's office is claiming that there are no suspicions at the moment that customers are given contaminated food.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County Prison, with a deposit of $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that a woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, the supply of meth, theft, possession of meth and possession of illegal weapons.
Johnson's giving a blow to the commotion of the postponement
Boris Johnson's journey to the United Nations General Assembly was inexorably interrupted by the historic ruling of the Supreme Court.
However, his crushing speech in the House of Communes did not betray either shame or remorse.
To explain the meaning of this coup, the eye of the cyclone is Tony Connelly, the editor of the European RTE section in Brussels and the London correspondent Sean Whelan in Westminster.

"Everybody's Talking About Jamie": castings for Jamie New's role at West End
Another great star, West Endu, is waiting to be discovered, although she doesn't know it yet.
The producers of "Everybody's Talking About Jamie" are looking for another Jamie New and are holding open hearings.
The current star Layton Williams is going on a tour tour of Britain with a musical, so the producers are looking for "a uniquely talented, undiscovered young performer".
The hearings will take place in London on 10 October at the Apollo Theatre, and candidates who hope to win should prepare 16 bars of the opening song "Don't Even Know It", as well as their CVs and portraits.
The hearing will also take place on 8th October in Sheffield, and the next week the producers will be invited to the presentation.
The producer Nico Burns said: "We are pleased to say that thanks to our fantastic audience, the musical will be played for another third year in Apollo."
We found some fantastic young performers who would join Layton Williams and Shane Richie during the tour.
Looking for a new Jamie, in the spirit of this musical, we open up opportunities for unknown talents to join the present young professionals.
Williams, who became Jamie New in February and thus replaced John McCrea, who originally played this role, encouraged all boys to send their tapes on Twitter:
This musical tour will start in February and the West End shows will be extended until 29 August 2020.
The musical presents the fates of 16-year-old Jamie New who wants to go to the prom at the graduation dress.
He doesn't know what the future will bring, but he's sure he'll be a star.
Thanks to the help of the mother and the local legend of the community of drag Loco Chanelle begins to discover its identity, to oppose prejudices and careers in the light of the flesh.
The music in this performance was inspired by BBC documentary film entitled "Jamie. Drag Queen at 16" by Dan Gillespie Sells, and the book and lyrics of songs by Tom MacRae.
Alfa Laval is commissioned in the natural gas industry with the value of SEK 110 million
Alfa Laval, a world leader in heating, centrifugal separation and liquid transport, has obtained a commission to supply air coolers to a gas processing plant in the USA.

The order includes Alpha Laval Niagara air coolers, which will be used in cooling systems to separate natural gas into the streams of its clean components – ethane, propane and butane.
Safety is crucial in all industrial processes and is extremely important in demanding applications related to natural gas treatment.
"Our reliable air cooler installations are recognized for their safe work, which provides peace for customers in the natural gas industry," says Susanne Pahlen Aklundh, President of the Energy Department.
Did you know that... ethane, propane, and butane can be separated from natural gas and then used, for example, as a feedstock for petrochemical installations, home heating or as a vehicle fuel?
Information about Alfa Laval

Marian Banas.
What's the KAS doing about the chief of NIK?
Renting real estate for an amount below the market price – these are reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of Marian Banasia's Supreme Control House.
We asked the Treasury House in Krakow and the Ministry of Finance about what the Treasury is doing in this matter.
Bertold Kittel in a report for "Superviser" TVN expressed doubts about the property statements made by the President of Marian Banasia's Supreme Control Board.
The Central Anti-corruption Office has been investigating them for several months.
The audit is due to end in the second half of October, after the parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a house of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65,7 thousand zlotys per year.
The report "Superviser" revealed that the hotel was located in a house rented by him for hours.
The head of NIK later explained on national television why he only collected just over 5,000 zlotys a month for renting real estate.
"Gazeta Wyborcza", referring to experts on real estate valuation, estimated that it should be 15 thousand zlotys per month for the building itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary agreement and it was precisely that the tenant was to buy this building that I agreed to lower rent, that the remaining debts would be settled at the sale of the building," Banas argued.
However, there were doubts as to whether such a procedure constituted a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, spokesperson of the Chamber of Treasury Administration in Krakow, informed in a conversation with TVN24 that "this case is directly dealt with by the Ministry of Finance".
"All such questions must be addressed to the Minister of Finance," he added.
Zaveza explained that in such cases "the National Tax Administration is conducting activities".
Press spokesman of the Ministry of Finance Paweł Jurek admitted that the National Treasury Administration itself monitors a number of matters that may raise some reservations.
“The National Treasury Administration operates in such a way that it has its own information, as well as in a sense based on information that is publicly available.
On this basis, he is deciding whether or not to conduct any specific case," explained the MF Ombudsman.
"In addition, because we are all bound by a tax secret throughout the Ministry of Finance, we never speak, because we cannot speak on individual matters of a particular taxpayer, a particular person or a particular company," he stressed, asking about the Marian Banasia case.
Mr Jerzy Kwieciński, Minister for Finance, stressed that "tax offices do not report this kind of message to the public".
"It is known that the entire tax apparatus deals with many similar cases throughout the country," he pointed out.
Secrets of the Royal Family: Surprising guests of often flying royal planes have been revealed
As part of their duties, members of the royal family must travel on hundreds of trips around the world during their lives.
This is usually facilitated by a royal plane – a private machine that drives a royal family around the world to important events and performances.
It's not surprising that having your own plane has to do with privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long queues for check-in, they do not have limits on the number of baggage and, as it turns out, they can invite any visitors – including truly unprecedented ones.
According to the recently premiered Channel 5 documentary film, not only the queen and Prince Philip often travels on a royal plane.
During the program entitled "The Secrets of Royal Flights", the former queen's flight navigator revealed that he and the royal family often flew furry guests.
Bob Shields said: “Sometimes, together with our very important royal guests, very important royal dogs could fly. ”
It is not surprising that the Queen could wish her beloved loved ones to accompany her on her journeys, because she is known for her deep attachment to Corgi dogs.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elizabeth has been a fan of these four - begotten creatures and has been told that since the coronation she was the owner of more than 30 corgis.
It is said that in 2007 it had five corgis: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
Five cocker spaniels joined them: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spike and Span, as well as four dogs that are cross-breeded from Corgi: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
I'm sure the royal plane crew had their hands full.
A member of the royal house who brings dogs and asks them to meet their needs before taking them aboard the plane, says Shields.
I'm pleased to say there's never been an incident.
The programme also reveals a shocking number of baggage that the Queen takes on board during her journey in the performance of her duties.
The narrator said: “In 1953, the queen took 12 tons of luggage on her 70 000 km journey. ”
To be able to picture it better, it's about the same as two huge elephants.
But the Queen is not the only one with a weakness to fashion.
It is said that the princess of Cambridge also has her own pleasures in transporting her wardrobe – it is said that a separate seat is intended for each of her dresses.
The new law enters into force.
The victim will receive an old-age pension
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force to ensure that people who are seriously injured will continue to pay their pensions," the Financial Ombudsman informs.
It concerns the Law of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of persons affected in the event of an exhaustion of the guarantee amount established on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
In that case, they were significantly lower than the current guarantee amounts, so in some cases insurers have already ceased to pay their pensions.
"I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been seeking a mechanism for many years, which will provide a guarantee of financial support from the OC insurance or the OC farmer despite the exhaustion of the guarantee amount", says Aleksander Daszewski, legal advisor at the Office of the Financial Ombudsman.
According to the Financial Ombudsman, this was necessary because it is often a very tragic situation for people in very poor health who, due to the accident, cannot work, for example, while at the same time bear the significant costs of post-traumatic rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them no longer received compensatory pensions and increased needs due to the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the exhaustion of the so-called guarantee sums on the OC policies.
Some of them have threatened to do so in the coming years.
Until 1 January 2006, the limits on the liability of the insurer were significantly lower than those of the current one.
Therefore, the problem of exhaustion of the guarantee amount in previous years was most often affected by those who suffered damage in the 1990s.
The guarantee amounts were very low, and economic conditions resulted in an increase in prices.
"We have also noted that this problem has also affected a number of young people who have suffered damage at a time when the sum was 350 000 euros for each victim.
At present, it is EUR 5.21 million per event, regardless of the number of victims.
This is therefore a huge difference over earlier periods, which is why the problem required legislative intervention", recalls Alexander Daszewski.
It explains that, given that the guarantee amount has been increased every now and then, the legislator accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Insurance Guarantee Fund will be the sum of the guarantee applicable at the time of the payment of the pension claim to the Fund.
This rule shall apply where an insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay an old-age pension on the basis of a court ruling setting a guarantee amount other than that laid down in an OC insurance contract.
This is the case in the event of an increase in the amount of the guarantee on the judicial basis of Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for the modification of the existing liability relationship.
"In the last few days, we have sent letters to those who in the past have asked us for intervention.
We inform them of new powers and, of course, provide further support if any problems arise", says Aleksander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off a penis boy
The case concerns the events of November 2017.
According to Buenos Aires Times, Brenda Barattini was the one who found out that her boyfriend showed her friends the sex tape that was made in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who was an architect, explained before the court that her partner had ruined her life and treated her like a "trophy" that could be praised in front of friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He destroyed everything," she argued.
Cordoba's wife decided to do justice herself.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she had prepared a special surprise.
With a velvet band, she covered his eyes, and then grabbed the secateur and cut off his penis.
"I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled up my pants, and I grabbed a cell phone to call an ambulance," the victim testified.
"I wanted to leave, but she started insulting me.
She grabbed my shirt and my hair without letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend hurt her by exposing sexts, she didn't try to escape her responsibility.
"I'm asking for justice," she said to the jury.
She was finally found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
Former Congressman of the State of Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91
On Friday, a retired Congressman of the State of Alabama from the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The spokesman of the family said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting pancreatic cancer.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans in the state of Alabama in the Deep South because the party gained supporters here.
He served 10 terms in Congress.
According to a statement by the family in response to a recent question about what the world would like to leave to its lawyers and great-grandsons, Edwards replied that he would like to return courtesy.
"I hope that my lawyers and my grandchildren will grow up in a country where kindness will return to a joint debate and efforts to solve the problems of the country," said Edwards, according to his family statement.
The Governor of the State of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his status and country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that in his honor the flag of the Alabama State Capitol will be abandoned by half the mast.
"He was the personification of a real state official and was the best man of the state for Alabama.
Our state lost one of the most outstanding politicians" - said Ivey in her statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed her high appreciation for Meghan Markle on Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a caring leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world a better place."
The Duchess and Prince Harry, now on a ten-day royal journey to South Africa with their son Arch Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, attended a meeting with the youth at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
"I would like to thank my friend, Her Majesty, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, "a caring leader who breaks the patterns and makes our world better," wrote the first lady in her enthusiastic post.
"While meeting with the leaders of the Obama @ObamaFoundation Foundation, or helping girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve, it is an inspiration for many people," Obama added, putting in a picture of the smiling Meghan with the leaders of the Foundation.
Meghan interviewed Obama for the September edition of the British Vogue, a guest-edited former actress of "Suits".
The first lady was speaking about motherhood and how she changed her.
"Being a mother means leading to the art of forgiveness," she said in Obama's interview.
“Motherhood has taught me that for most of my time it is my job to give children space so that they can learn about the world and become who they want to be.
Not who I want to be or who I wanted to be at their age, but who they are in their hearts.
Obama, who from experience knows what the pressure of being on a candlestick is, shared with the princess the advice during an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"The pressure you feel – imposed by yourself and by others – can sometimes overwhelm you," she said.
“My advice is therefore to slow down and not rush into anything.
The first few months at the White House, I spent most of my time worrying about my daughters, making sure they were doing well at school and making new connections before I took up more ambitious work.
I think it's necessary, too.
Hotel Trumpa retains the permission to sell alcohol despite a complaint by the owner
WASHINGTON (AP) The D.C. Alcohol Control Commission has dismissed the request requesting that the local Trump International Hotel should lose its licence to sell alcohol on the basis of the owner's attitude.
The Agency ordered on Wednesday that three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbis should be brought to justice because most of them do not live in or own a district.
"The Washington Post" states that, for the second time, these plaintiffs are seeking the withdrawal of an alcohol-saleing licence to the hotel, referring to a provision in force in the district that applicants for an alcohol-sale must show "good attitude".
The original complaint last summer claimed that President Donald Trump was breaking the law, calling charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud.
The complaint was dismissed because the licence was granted before it was filed.
The reason for the second complaint was to extend the authorisation.
"The Sun": The crushing report considers the police scandal in Cleveland to be the worst in the UK
The inspectors found the police to be the worst police in the UK.
In a crushing report, they assessed the police work in Cleveland as inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley, Chief Inspectorate of Her Majesty's Police Department, claims that there was a "significant deterioration" of standards in Cleveland police services.
New calls have been made for the termination of police services, headed by five commanders in six years.
According to the report, the police have not tried to prevent crime, arrest suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley, Chief Inspectorate of Her Majesty’s Police, said: “There has been a significant deterioration in standards since our last inspection. ”
Chief Mike Veale resigned in January after less than a year in the face of an investigation into "serious" but undisclosed charges against him.
Deputy Chief Adrian Roberts was suspended after the arrest on the charge of gross malpractice.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood appeared in front of the Crimes Committee for bringing female female coworkers into sexual activity.
He's out of the service.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of Tories said: “It is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for him to intervene at the Home Office."
Police Commandant Richard Lewis said: "After the improvements have been made, I take full responsibility for carrying out police forces through changes."
We have a visualization of the skatepark!
Will the young finally wait?
Older people are disturbed by young enthusiasts of scooters and skateboards, while they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Oława.
For years, young people have forgotten to ride rollers, skateboards, scooters, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to us.
We've been paying attention to this problem for the last 10 years.
Last time I checked, it got loud again about the absence of a skatepark.
That's why we're going back to that and asking the office what's next?
We remind you that a few days ago, a woman who's been disturbed by young people driving downtown came in.
"I am writing on behalf of the residents of the block at Pilsudski to be interested in the situation of Olawsk youth", writes Małgorzata.
“The blockers have repeatedly called the City Guard ineffective.
In order to prove such everyday situations, I send pictures."
We asked the others about this.
Most clearly say that young people simply have no place to drive in the city, and for years they have been ineffectively demanding a place for themselves.
There was an avalanche of comments under the post on Facebook.
We already wrote in July that there was a chance that skatepark was built on the Olawsk Town.
The mayor reported that the city had requested funding to build a skate park.
"The project, together with the permits, is ready to be consulted with young people.
On 28 March, an application was submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for funding of the task of “Building Skatepark in Oława” under the Polish Sport Programme, we were told at the Office.
Total value of the project: 798 306,00 PLN.
Amount of funding requested: PLN 263 440,00.
Now we've asked you again at what stage the case is.
"We do not yet have information on the decisions submitted to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism about the application for funding", reports Elżbieta Bednarczyk, Head of the European Funds Department, UM Olawa.
"It follows from the information obtained from the Ministry's staff that the final selection of all tasks under the Polish Sport Programme should take place in October".
We also asked to visualize the Olawsk skatepark.
We present it below.
Young people have informed the editor that they will be collecting signatures under petition for the construction of a skatepark in Oława next Saturday (28 September).
"The rebels saw the last post on Facebook, and they concluded that they would organize a collection," writes Santa Claus.
Signatures under petition will be collected from 12.00 p.m. in the vicinity of Lidl Market.
Polish Cup 2019/20: 1/16 final draw.
We know couples, hit from years ago
It was one of the most fierce rivalries in the extraclass.
The biggest legend was the 1996/1997 memorial match.
On 18 June 1997, Legia started a team in the previous line at the old stadium in Łazienkowski.
Both teams divided the point.
The hosts had to win, the second in a row the Polish Championship gave a point.
Until 87 minutes the Legia ran 2 to 0, but for five consecutive minutes there was an earthquake – Widzew scored three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódź club over the years fell into more and more trouble until it stopped counting on it to fight for the championship and fell from the highest level of the game.
For the last time, the two teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
The legion – on its way to the title – has won two victories – 5:1 at its home and 1:0 at its departure.
Back to elite
Today, boaters are fighting for a return to their national elite.
These plans have been delayed by at least one year, since in previous games, being one of the favorites, they have not been able to advance to the background of the extraction class.
As a result of this failure in the summer, there was a human revolution at the club.
The authorities have changed, they have finally been placed on coach Marcin Kaczmark, and in taking the next step up the club hierarchy they are to help with the league fights Marcin Robak and Mateusz Możdżń.
So far Widzew is the fourth in the second-league table, but in the Polish Cup he defeated on Tuesday the vice-leader of the Śląsk Wrocław 2:0.
The legion of the same size played on the desert of Niepołomice.
Extraglass takeoff
The only couple made up of representatives of the highest class in the 1/16 final form its beniaminek LKS and Górnik Zabrze.
The swords of this phase will take place from 29 to 31 October.
This year, 1/8 of the finals were planned (3-5 December).
The final will take place on 2 May at the National PGE in Warsaw.
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr “rebeled” and impeachment investigation must take place on his own track
You never know where we're going.
Now, in my opinion, we are involved in trying to hide the facts of an attempt to hide facts, and the investigation may take time," said Pelosi in an interview for CNN on the Capitol Hill.
"They do the work they started, sticking to the facts and the time necessary to find them," she added.
According to the protocol issued this week by the White House, Trump asked the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenski, to conduct an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden, the candidate from 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked Zelenski to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on this matter, as stated in the minutes.
Trump denied doing anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN reported that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice notified a complaint by the signaler concerning Trump's proceedings with Ukraine more than a week before the formal notification.
After receiving a complaint as a complaint from the Intelligence Community officials, the Department of Justice stated that Trump's telephone conversation did not provide a criminal investigation into campaign financing.
Asked if Barr should testify, Pelosi said that on Friday, Intelligence Committee will decide who to call to witness.
She added, however, that Barr believed that he had "rested".
It's been like this for a long time.
"Barra mentions herself in all of this", added Pelosi, referring to Trump's mention of his Attorney General during the July interview with the Ukrainian leader.
Interestingly, he made decisions on how to handle a complaint.
Pelosi reported that she was "very afraid" of signal informants that Trump attacked as spies on Thursday, suggesting that spies had been treated differently in the past.
I think the President's words go beyond their responsibilities. It's dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in discovering – uncovering crimes in our government,” said Pelosi, adding “The words of the President regarding people able to provide information signalically undermine integrity in the government”.
On Tuesday, Pelosi carried out a historic step in a formal investigation into the commission of an illegal act based on allegations of attempts to put pressure on a foreign state leader in order to obtain political benefits.
The call was part of a complaint published on Thursday, in which the signaler claimed that Trump had abused his power to "incline Ukraine to interfere" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signator also argued that the White House lawyers had the officials remove the record of the conversation from the computer system in which it was stored for the officials of the Council of Ministers and put it in a system designed for sensitive information.

Possible driving ban at excessive speed for the attack of the Crystal Palace Christian Benteke
The Premier League star to Christian Bentke, who has been caught twice for speeding in the last two months, is threatened with a driving ban.
Crystal Palace assailant, 28 years old, admitted to driving a Bentley car at 80 miles an hour in the area with a limit of 50 miles an hour on the A3 road in Richmond, southwest London on 20 January.
Then, in March, the Putney cameras in south-west London recorded Belga at a speed of 89 miles an hour, twice the limit of 40 miles an hour.
Bentke from Kingston Hill of Surrey doesn't have to stand up this morning at the Lavender Hill Peace Court.
He confessed to both offences at the beginning of July under a simplified procedure under which lighter crimes are judged at a meeting held by a single Judge of the Peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu is concerned about the structure of the Verification Commission
Kofi Manu, a football manager and representative of the Sekondi Hasaacas club, raised doubts about the composition of the Verification Commission for the upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the inclusion of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, adding that he was not happy with his participation.
In an interview with GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be fair because the outcome of the verification process is in his interest.
The Verification Commission should consist of neutral outsiders who show no links with any of the members and who have previously shown no interest.
For example, Davies hired NC as a lawyer who wrote Osei Kwaku Palmer in relation to payments of 10 percent.
He is also a well-known supporter of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take a position in the Verification Commission because he has an interest in it", he argued.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, the Director of the Olympic Games, were to appear before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President because of his connection with the club, suggesting that if Palmer were to be the subject of prejudice and bias before the Commission.
As expected, the members of the Commission were due to begin their work yesterday, after the oath at the GFA Secretariat ceremony in Akra on Tuesday, 19 September, and to conclude it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and its members are consultants on corporate governance and lawyer Marian Barnor and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
The other members include Reginald Laryea, Director of Marketing and Business and Richard Akpokavie, Sport Administrator and Lawyer.

Israel: There is no agreement on the government of unity
The two main parties of Israel, the Blue-White and Likud Alliance, continued negotiations on Friday on the establishment of a government of unity.
The meeting, which took place after the President's mission to form the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, did not produce results.
The discussions considered the possibility of a rotating leadership of both parties in the government and of remaining Netanyahu as Prime Minister, but, as the Israeli newspaper "Haarec" writes, there was no convergence of views.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of Blue and Whites reported in the Communication that it had made initial requests.
He accuses right-wing Likud that he "kicked himself in his positions" demanding that his leader and former prime minister Netanyahu remain in charge of the government and in the composition of the office – the former ultra-orthodox politicians.
"It has been clear from the outset that Blue-Whites will not agree to these conditions," the communication they have published.
Because, in Netanyahu’s sole interest, it “wants to lead to the second round of elections in Israel. ”
Blue-White leader Benny Gantz refuses to support the government that Netanyahu would run until he is accused of participating in three corruption cases, on the basis of which the prosecution could formally accuse him after the Wednesday meeting.
"The People and Blue-Bialys obtained a sufficient majority in the September 17 elections to allow common governments as natural allies, but it forces them to negotiate, which none of the parties wanted," writes the EFE.
President Reuwen Rivlin has tried to bring their positions closer in recent days and has proposed the creation of a "rotary government", suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his duties, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the accusations against Netanyahu were upheld and formalised.
There are no shortages of Israeli analysts who believe that things are stuck in a dead end.
However, half of the Israelis, according to a survey published on Friday by public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by setting up a government of unity under the rotating leadership of Netanyahu and Gantz.
This is supported by 50.6% of Israelis, and 32.1% of respondents oppose such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in the Israeli society – who should be the first to lead the office, 41.8% to support Netanyahu, and 40% to follow Gantz.
In another survey published by the journal "Israel Hajom", the percentage of members of the government of unity is increasing to 63%, 60% are opposed to the new elections that would be third this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, Gantz won 33 seats in the 120-place Knesset, Likud Netanyahu won 32 seats.
Netanyahu with its traditional and potential allies can count on 55 Members, while Gantz can count on 54 Members.
None of the parties gathered the 61 seats necessary to obtain the majority.
Tipuric calls for a fight against the final Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "it's time to check out" when Wales is facing a final match against Australia as part of the World Cup, which can shape their fate in the tournament.
The victory of Wales over the "kangures" would set this team as a favorite for winning Group D and guaranteeing participation in the likely quarter-final meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia defeats Wales for the 14th time in the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be immediately rescinded to England in one eighth final.
"Let's make it clear that both teams want to try to get through this and be at the forefront of the group," said the Welsh fighter Tipuric.
There have been some difficult results in the past, but last fall it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're gonna be eager to take this victory away from us, and we're going to have to bring it back.
By the time we got here, you knew it was gonna be a big run.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check it out.
Wales won only one victory over Australia, New Zealand or South Africa in the history of the World Cup – and it took place 32 years ago in the match of the third place when they defeated the "kangaroos".
And their total record under coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three heavyweight teams from the southern hemisphere.
Wales stopped a series of thirteen test matches at the hands of Australia last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few survivors of this 9-6 win that will run to the stadium in Tokyo on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether the team had experienced a mental blockage before this victory, adding: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so leveled up, maybe... people expect a mental block to happen, I don't know.
After all, in the last game, we probably left about 15 points on the field, so the final score looks a lot lower than it actually was.
If Wales triumphs, then the fight against the beloved Australian duo with the third line by Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the arrest and defeat will be essential.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in the colours of the team and met both players on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what awaits him.
"These are players playing in the seventh position of absolutely world class," he said.
When you play against world-class third-line players, you always know that the game will be difficult to play.
These two are constantly performing with the best players in the world.
You know what kind of game to expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably better to feel rugby because he is always in the right place at the right time.
It is better to play against the best players in the world and to face challenges than to face the third line of a mill that is not so good.
It is worth playing against the best, and when you struggle with these two, you must certainly be in top form.
I wouldn't say Sunday's almost the cup finale, but for us, it's an important match in this World Cup.
Impet is an important part of it.
When we build our strength and constantly make big efforts, we'll ride like a wing and it'll be hard to beat us.

The book premiere.
"Waffen-SS" Jochen Boehler, Robert Gerwarth, Jacek Młynarczyk
They were supposed to be the elite "men's race" organization.
They accepted in their ranks those whom they despised.
Is crime more powerful than national identity?
In your hand we give another book on war or military issues.
We are giving a deep international study on non-German participation in Waffen-SS.
Historians from different European countries analyze the attitudes and motivations of volunteers, remind them of their activities and look at recruitment processes at different stages of war.
Were the Danish troops different from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why was it not possible to create a branch composed of Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative on cooperation in different European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war?
Among other things, the book “Waffen-SS” answers these questions based on solid research material.
We sought to present a subtler and more balanced, closer truth of the image of collaboration in Europe during World War II, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of history and a given period of history by presenting a report by researchers from various countries. (...) As long as the fates of the main victims of this war - forced laborers, Jews, prisoners, political opponents of Nazi Germany, the Slavic people - are sometimes presented in comparative and/or transnational terms, so many perpetrators are essentially examined from a national perspective (if this is done).
"Total panic" when the White House is struggling with finding arguments about impeachment
The White House officials struggle to figure out how to resist the pressures of impeachment that were renewed on Thursday, and one of the people familiar with the situation describes the sense of "total panic" felt last week due to the lack of a plan to respond to the new reality.
This seems to increase "anxiety, uncertainty and concern" – one of the people associated with the White House describes the mood in the western wing – that the accusations of an informant can seriously harm the president and the people around him.
She said: “It is not certain that there is nothing there. ”
The White House officials were still uncertain about how to act, not only because there is no obvious plan of action in this situation, but also because the charges are so serious that the standard methods of effective avoidance of the controversy used by the President in the past may not work. "This does not seem to be something that will pass along with the next cycle of message headlines" – she made a joke.
Another person who knew the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as “a state of shock” accompanied by increasing mistrust that, with the ongoing investigation into impeachment, the likelihood of the President responding irresponsiblely and becoming “hard to master”.
This fear is shared by another spokesperson claiming that the people of the President's surroundings predict that he will show a more "porous" behaviour, and the pressure on him will certainly start to increase every day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected way erupt – this is in the context of the electoral year of concern both from the point of view of the presidency and of the elections.
When facing the greatest threat in the presidency so far, Trump was circling from attack to defense, again reaching for a strategy he assessed as effective in investigating Robert Mueller in Russia.
He tried to ignore his own request to the Ukrainian president for help in investigating his political rivals in order to distract and direct Joe Biden's democrats and democratic candidate and to discredit the informant as a leading party motive.
But while many people in the White House are well-trained in the fight after the Mueller investigation, this time something has changed – said the consultants and consultants.
The president, whose signature is strength, showed the Wednesday press conference as a loser, said one of the people familiar with the situation.
While Trump enthusiastically accepted questions about the Russian investigation, he did not seem to be willing to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the President's allies believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them stick to the fact that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of the controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenski, which, according to them, undermines his credibility.
And as often happens when the President is the subject of the attacks, this fact is raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies associated with the White House indicates that the results of the polls of support for the President are unbottomly high, and the impeachment will not much influence the acquisition of new sympathizers.
"There is no positive need to focus on the President's impeachment in the next four months," in particular if its legislative programme makes this difficult and predominant in the new cycle of news headlines.
Another spokesperson claims that those who maintained that impeachment would help the president did not fully understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
The worried White House officials were looking for help from the counselors, putting together an impeachment response team.
According to the person with knowledge of the plans, given that these efforts are in the early stages, it remains unclear whether any initiative in the style of command will be taken and what form it can take.
This person stated that there was a belief that a coordinated legal and communication strategy was required with a strong leader capable of carrying out a PR attack, which was a rife to the publication of a gruesome signaler report and aimed at halting the momentum of the democrats on the impeachment given by the disclosure of this report.
A spokesperson familiar with the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Secretary of Treasury Steve Mnuchin stated that they were not going to disclose a memo describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian President, and then 48 hours later it was possible to feel that there was no way out and a document had to be published.
The pressure is now expected to be greater than in Robert Mueller's investigation, which mostly kept silent, and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who may be involved in drawing up an impeachment response is Corey Lewandowski, a man from Trump's dirty work and a former head of the electoral staff – said a person related to the case.
But Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it's not true to suggest that he would be in charge of this action.
"For the last five years, I have done everything I can to support the President and his program," he said, "but I have not had any conversations with the President or his team about joining the team to refute the false narrative of impeachment."
Donald Trump's private attorney in the Mueller investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in impeachment activities.
“We respond to matters as they should” – Sekulow responded when he was asked by NBC News to comment.
At present, the White House feels the lack of an impeachment lawyer, after Emmet Flood, who worked on Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and Pat Cipollone, the current advisor, did not have this kind of experience.
A spokesperson familiar with the White House strategy stated that, in general, officials had no intention of involving people or creating a command centre, but admitted that there was a need for a coordinated, joint response and a person capable of conducting a political fight.
The explorer Explorer of the Seas by the Royal Caribbean has been renovated for £89 million
Explorer of the Seas, a member of the Royal Caribbean International family, will go on a cruise this summer, presenting a completely new look.
After renewing the impressive 110 million dollars ($89 million), the ship enjoys a wide selection of culinary delicacies from all over the world and a rich entertainment offer for the entire family.
This summer Explorer will stay in the most wonderful ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on land is over, the crew of the ship promises an unforgettable impression at sea.
With an offer to satisfy everyone, Explorer, at a refurbishment costing 110 million dollars, i.e. around 89 million pounds, transferred to a passenger ship providing excellent entertainment for the entire family.
Impressive technology means that passengers can surf on board with advanced surfing simulators or watch their favorite family movie, using the charms of the weather as part of the outdoor cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is the addition of virtual balconies, which enables the passengers of the cabins to admire the views of the ocean without having to board.
Water lovers will delight the newly designed deck by the pool combining the style of the Caribbean resort with the charms of the water park.
The swimming pool is surrounded by beach hammocks and sunbeds ideal for lying in the sun, and two modernized slides are within reach of people thirsty for strong sensations on board.
A trip attractive to passengers of all ages impresses with the number of activities available to guests while travelling to the destinations.
Created for the young adventure ocean for children is an opportunity for younger family members to enjoy beautiful memories, and the exclusive place to spend their free time for teenagers offers a super-game and music zone prepared for people over 12 years of age.
If this proves insufficient, the entire family can in "studio B" on the ship face a laser tag with the effect of lighting in the dark, which in an impressive way can also serve as a ice skating site.
During the cruise around the Mediterranean, guests will also have the opportunity to get to know exotic flavors from all over the world, going on a conquest of restaurants on board.
The modern Asian cuisine is offered on a boat in the Izumi restaurant, while the freshly opened Giovanni's Italian Kitchen serves excellent food inspired by an innovative look at the traditional Italian cuisine.
The other gastronomic points on board include the American Chops Grill steak restaurant, Boleros Latin Bar, Schooner Bar and Johnny Rockets Express Bar.
The cruise, with the option of a seven- or nine-day route, leaves Rome in May 2020.
As the second European ship belonging to the Royal Caribbean line will join the Allure of the Seas, which has recently undergone an incredible renovation.
After a 58-day metamorphosis of Allure, a total of $165 million, the cruise operator offered a 300-dollar voucher to the guests who had previously booked on board the ship.
The tour operator said: "Explorer of the Seas is the fourth class ship to undergo the transformation of the Royal Amplified fleet."
The programme, which requires an investment of over $1 billion, covering 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of opportunities: from unique attractions and gastronomic experiences to nightlife.
Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of demanding "naked pictures of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes of California apparently cannot bear the naked truth that there is an investigation into President Donald Trump.
In his Thursday defense, the President accused the Democrats of wanting to get naked pictures of the President.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican in the House of Representatives Intelligence Commission, made the above plea in the course of the statement at the hearing following a signaler’s complaint that Trump had asked Ukraine for assistance in initiating an investigation against the Democratic candidate for President Joe Biden and his son.
The congressman called the Ukrainian scandal the "grotesque performance" of the left and their "medial ace" before saying that the Democrats wanted to see pictures of the president in the negligee.
"Democrats in this committee negotiated with people who according to them were Ukrainians to get naked pictures of Trump," said Nunes.
"People may rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to put the President in charge once they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes finished reprimanding, political reporter HuffPost, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats were really trying to... discover it.
Until now, only the representative of Connecticut, Jim Himes, has responded, although we suspect that his response is the naked truth, confirming the thoughts of many of his colleagues.
Mediaite.com suspected that Nunes' comments on nudity referred to "certainly more ludicrous and unconfirmed information" that probably appeared in Steele's controversial files,
It is famous, collected by former British spy Christopher Steele, a collection of charges against Trump, indicating the probability of a tape that shows him watching the urinate of a prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential research on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Semi Tesla have dominated information services in recent years, one question seems to be to escape renewable energy – aircraft.
However, a professor at the University of Alberta developed a technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as aviation fuel.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at the University of Alberta in the Department of Agriculture, Life Science and Environment, who started working on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops hydrocarbon fuel obtained from fat waste, such as restaurant fat, animal fats and rapeseed oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology can use lower-quality oils during its production, with an estimated 85% lower carbon emissions than for oil fuels, as well as waste from other industries.
This technology is intended to imitate the hydrocarbons present in petroleum fuels.
"What our technology has done in the first generation," Bressler said, "is [in total] the creation of hydrocarbons, which are identical particles to diesel fuel."
While this opens up a new possibility for biofuels to be used, the biofuels previously developed tended to be destabilised at lower temperatures, which posed a serious risk for large-scale aircraft.
"The problem with aviation fuel is a bit of a vicious circle," Bressler said.
It's actually less worth than diesel, but it has higher demands.
Bressler's laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional treatment of hydrocarbon biofuels and the addition of hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on some of the chemical properties that have already been developed, which will provide fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," Bressler said, commenting on the second option.
This option is more risky.
The company created by Alberta University, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on commercialising the product, as airlines, as well as the Canadian and American armies, are increasing investment in renewable options.
"They are able to imagine the times when the situation may be reversed and carbon tax imposed on them" - he said.
Instead, they want an alternative that will form an emergency plan.
Forge is currently operating a pilot facility near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received a total of $4 million from Lockheed Martin as part of an investment to support a $25 million construction plant in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce approximately 19 million litres of biofuels per year.
Bressler also notes that the expected carbon reduction will be around 85 percent, but issues such as transport and fuel production are holding back further carbon reductions.
"As a specialist in technology," Bressler said: "
I have the task of developing options that enable informed decisions and many options to be chosen."
NEXT: Another cheating on the granddaughter
8 thousand PLN and 750 EUR lost Zamość's apartment thinking she was helping her grandson, who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday to the son of a defrauded prodigy.
"The woman was called on Wednesday by a man claiming to be her grandson.
He said he caused an accident and needed money.
Otherwise, he's going to jail.
In order to help her grandson, she transferred PLN 8,000 and EUR 750 to the fake police officer who came to her house," reports assp. Dorota Krukowska-Budzi z Zamośćmejm police.
The police are looking for the perpetrator, and again they're calling for caution:
"Every phone asking for financial assistance should be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotion or in haste.
Remember, the police don't ask for money and they don't accept money.
If you receive a call asking for financial support, which will raise our suspicions you should respond immediately and notify the police by calling 112.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about the threats, let's see how the fraud works.
Please be careful and do not trust people who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's allies warn us that if the brilliance is withdrawn, they're threatening to kill people like Los Angeles, and he's calling for peace.
One of the chief cabinet ministers said last night that the country was threatened with a "violent social payoff" if the original result was questioned by the outcome of the second referendum.
The allies of the British Prime Minister from his immediate surroundings warned that the countries were threatened by social unrest on the scale of "yellow vests" protests in France due to social inequalities and riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for a "settlement of moods" during a turbulent argument on the political language, but stressed that he would not stop using the word "submission".
Despite his call for peace, the Minister of the Office said: "The Times": "In this country there have never been protests such as "gilets jaunes" ("yellow vests") or riots in Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because it didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – guilets jaunes – using encrypted phones, through which they can coordinate the piciles, and to push people into the protest it is enough for a few unfriendly populist leaders.
The riots in Los Angeles erupted after the jury acquitted four white police officers who beat up Rodney King's black cab driver in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow reflective vests – the jaunes guillet – have been desolating and destroying the streets of Paris for more than six weeks.
The Minister referred to the warning of Johnson in the House of Communes and said that if the United Kingdom fails to leave the EU, there would be a "catastrophaliaous loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we organise a referendum with 30 million people and 66% of them will support the UK's stay in the European Union, ten million people will remain disgruntled," said the Minister.
Even if such a result ignores 99% of them, we will still have 100,000 angry people who will write to their messenger and who will not forgive.
There is much to see on the street soon a few dozen thousand people.
One of the main ministers of the office added that the country is threatened with "violent social poverty" if the outcome of the first referendum is called into question by the result of the second.
Johnson called for a general election in which voters would decide the fate of the brixit.
According to the reports, the Prime Minister is facing the risk of a rebellion of the office wanting to lower its demands in terms of brixit and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
The holodeck, Chubówna and Krosny were delighted in Krakow.
Follow us, Talk'N'Roll
More than 300 participants heard 11 inspiring speeches by speakers, including Szymon Holovnia, Krystyna Czubówna and Ireneusz Krosny, on Thursday (26 September).
This was all in the framework of the Talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Extending the horizons, talking about ideas worthy of publicity, and sharing discussions that may give rise to further development.
This was the aim of the Talk'N'Roll conference organizers, inviting 11 exceptional speakers, representing a wide range of industries and areas of interest, including people known from the media - Szymon Holovnia, Krystina Chubówna and Ireneusz Krosny.
The slogan of this year's edition of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the future, NOW" and just around the creation of the future were the speeches of guests invited to participate in the conference.
The first session was opened by the Managing Director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drzewiecki, who talked about how the brand that is being built around him can have an impact on our future.
Richard Lucas went on stage to change the public's perception of rejection, claiming that they should be accepted if the future is to be created, and Chris Badura took on the topic of empathy in a time of rapid technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) shared observations and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between working and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a multi-threading conversation with Krystina Czubówna, who talked about how the teacher's profession in Poland changed over the years.
The holder of one of the most popular voices in the country admitted that – thanks to the development of technology – everyone can today find this profession difficult.
However, he does not think that, in the years to come, man is completely replaced by technology as a teacher.
After it, Piotr Nabielec took on the problem of life in times of information, emotional overload, or overloading of choice, giving the public valuable tips on how to deal with it, and in his speech, Łukasz Łętocha spoke about what the next industrial revolution, known as "Industry 4.0", could lead to.
Having fun teaching, teaching fun
The conference organizers also took care of the artistic impressions by inviting an illusionist, Daniel Jénalak, to the stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first entertained the audience with a pantonym and then, on an example of his own career, talked about how he was trying to maintain the right balance between his career on the stage and his private life.
The participants were also kidnapped by Simon Holovnia, emphasising first of all the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can dramatically change the situation and you need to be ready to take advantage of this time.
In addition, the holodeck shared his thoughts about the reality surrounding us, recalling anecdotes that could cause a smile on the faces of the viewers.
Adrian Tworuszka then appeared on stage, reviewing the history and objectives of several innovation models and referring to how they are being used today.
At the end of Marcin Sloviak, on an example of Rubik's ankle, he told us about the approach to solving problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly brought something new to the perception of the reality of all those who had the opportunity to see the performances, and the natural reactions and numerous questions to the guests show a great commitment from the public.
The organizers provided a transmission for all those who were unable to attend the event in person and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
"Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the majority has introduced a number of changes to the state system, creating threats to the rule of law and the principle of the triangle of power", writes the Helsinki Foundation of Human Rights, published on Thursday.
The report "The rule of law instead of the rule of law" documents, among other things, changes in the justice system and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
On Thursday, the Helsinki Human Rights Foundation published a report entitled “The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
Risks to the protection of human rights in Poland in 2015–2019".
The Foundation estimates in the report that in 2015-2019 the largest regression in the area of human rights protection in Poland was recorded after 1989.
“Despite the lack of sufficient votes to amend the Constitution, the majority has introduced a number of changes to the state system, creating threats to the rule of law protection and the principle of the division of power.
By adapting the law to political objectives, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law", writes HFPC experts.
What's in the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media and the Ombudsman) and in the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, the rights of LGBT people and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarizes the three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on this scale, we have observed the use of the right to pursue participatory party interests.
This translated into an ongoing crisis of the rule of law, as well as a weakening of the whole system of human rights protection in Poland," said the lawyer Marcin Free, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years are "a period of systemic change in both the country" and "for the protection of human rights".
Over the last four years, the Sejm has adopted more than 20 key human rights instruments.
"The changes were often adopted at a hasty pace, without public consultation and despite the reservations of the legal groups, the Ombudsman or international organisations", explained lawyer Małgorzata Szulek, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the last four years are: "weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), disregarding binding judgments of courts and recommendations of international institutions and weakening the guarantee of protection of human rights".
State authorities have not responded
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs considered it particularly worrying that "these situations where state authorities did not react or ignored cases of aggression".
The Foundation’s experts noted that some changes were made in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups exposed to discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of state activity in the area of the limitation of the rule of law is the ongoing dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations from international law actors.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations not only weakens Poland's position as a leader of democratic changes in the region of Central and Eastern Europe, but also exposes the Polish state to responsibility for violations of European Union law or the European Convention on Human Rights," says the report.
Brother of Pakistani social media star with life for honorary murder
Women's rights experts argue that justice investigations are often difficult due to prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected killers for bail and the contamination of cases in public opinion.
“It takes so long that people forget,” says Farzana Bari, a rights defender of women and founder of the first gender studies at the university in Pakistan, and adds that even the widely publicized murder case of Baloch has been resolved for more than three years.
Although reliable data is difficult to determine according to the groups fighting for women's rights, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission in 2018 concluded at least 300 cases of so-called honorary killings.
Many activists claim that the actual number is much higher, and the network promoting awareness of honorary crime estimates that there is about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings committed every year around the world in Pakistan.
Record earnings of Poles abroad
However, transfers to the country are decreasing, because many emigrants settle outside Poland permanently – says the Friday "Rzeczpospolita".
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that the average earnings of Poles working in other European countries amounted to more than PLN 8,6 thousand in 2018, which means that they increased by almost a thousand zlotys, i.e. almost 12%.
Euro-Tax estimates that the total income of Polish economic emigrants in the EU countries reached a record value of PLN 154.5 billion in 2018, by one seventh more than a year before," we read.
Director of the Centre for Research on Migration at the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczyk says that Poles are getting better on the international labour market, where they take advantage of various available options.
"There is a growing number of specialists and professionals who move from country to country in search of better conditions, as well as employees of international corporations," says the newspaper.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries during the year, such as the UK and Germany.
"This is the most important thing in RFN in 2018, because by 11%, total earnings of Polish emigrants increased (to almost 27 billion zlotys).
However, Poles made the most money in the islands – almost 35 billion PLN", we read on.
The President of Euro-Tax believes that despite improving working conditions on the Polish market, the number of economic emigrants does not decrease.
In fact, still sax in the West and North of Europe (leading with Norway) is often an opportunity for several times higher earnings than in Poland.
"Even at a minimum rate in a given country, which e.g. in Germany amounts to EUR 9.5-11.7 per hour", he informs the daily.
"Rzeczpospolita" states that Poles stay not only because of higher earnings, but also because they settled abroad.
Many Poles are rooting abroad, which is also visible after falling transfers of money to the country.
These were the lowest last year.
As the economist Tadeusz Chrościcki recalls, with the extension of the period of stay abroad, a group of people transferring money to and from the country is decreasing.
"Emmigrants bring their loved ones together," says the "Rzeczpospolita" on Friday.
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extended for almost a month, and unusual rainfall has caused death as a result of many crops and buildings.
Usually in northern India, monsoon declines at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall this month exceeded 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Weather Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be a final monsoon for decades at the latest.
In many areas of the country, rainfall is still unprecedented – in the recent period, in the west of India, the city of Pune, Wednesday and Thursday’s heavy rains have led to the death of several people and to the desolation of buildings.
There was flooding of houses, people were walking through the streets in the water on their knees, which normally occurs only during the monsoon appogeum.
Major rainfall has also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Lucknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of the long rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand, many houses have been destroyed.
Monsun also started to delay.
In many areas, there was no water, so farmers were preparing for the likely drought.
The long-lasting monsoon is not welcome by farmers.
This amount of rain is not normal at this time of year.
“By him my vegetables – and now I have cabbage, beans, peas and tomatoes – will rot,” says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal, Uttarakhand.
For consumers, the impact of delayed and late-ending monsoon means an increase in the price of onions, an essential ingredient of Indian food.
Onion, for which you usually had to pay 20 rupees ($0.23) currently costs 80 rupees (approx. 1 pound) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai.
Festivals and festivals are also at risk.
The next big festival is the holiday of Dasara on 8 October, during which the Indians raise huge puppets like from a comic book depicting Ravana, a character with a lush moustache and an evil smile from the epic "Ramajan".
Smoking Ravana symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, given that Ravana's resemblance has been made of paper, if monsoon continues to continue, it is Ravana who will laugh last.

Doodle celebrates Google's 21st birthday
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we are looking for answers to all the questions we are concerned about.
What are we looking for on Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How many?" are one of Poles' favorite categories.
According to the giant, last year we were happy to ask, “Where’s the storm?”, “How to make a spawn?” and “How many fingers does a horse have?”, “How to get rid of a fly of fruit?”, “How to eat cocoa?”.
Today's search engine celebrates its first 20th birthday.
Its users – and in Poland, as many as 96% of people use Google’s uncle – welcome Google Doodle today.
It's not animated this time.
Google reminds of its birthdays, showing a fixed computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the lower right corner a digital date was printed – as in the picture from the 1990s.
Cannot initialise Evolution's mail component.
The search engine was created for a specific purpose – it was intended to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term googol meaning the number of ten raised to the hundredth power.
This name was also intended to reflect the company's intentions to indexed as many pages from global Internet resources as possible.
Google search engine was founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties, which acted better than the methods of normal segregating the results based on the frequency of a given phrase.
At the beginning, the search engine had the name BlackRub, referring to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages linking to the result.
Page and Brin founded Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon later launched the famous Google.com site.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, in the "PC Magazine", information appears about the extremely high relevance of Google's search results.
Then the company's history looks almost like a fairy tale - rapid development with every month, conquering subsequent markets and increasing the company's value.
Already in June 2000, the Google URL index has over a billion positions, making Page and Brin's work the biggest search engine in the world.
Currently, Page and Brina's company is one of the leading players on the IT market.
Is there any other development field?
“The mission of Google is to organise global information resources to be widely accessible and useful, even though we have made great progress in this field, it is still a very long way ahead of us to achieve this goal,” said Piotr Zalewski from Google Poland in his conversation with “Newsweek”.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
A new study suggests that dealing with exposure to plant protection products at high concentrations may result in a high risk of heart problems in later years of life.
This was the case with a group of Japanese-born Americans in Hawaii who have been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more exposed to heart disease or stroke.
"This study underlines the need to use personal protective equipment for the time of contact with pesticides at work and the importance of recording in medical records contact with such devices at work, as well as the control of standard factors increasing the incidence of heart disease," said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez, co-author of the study.
She is a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in Manoa.
The results were based on data from over 6000 men on the island of Oahu who took part in the Honolululu Koakini cardiology program.
As the researchers pointed out, the results of the study may not apply to women and other populations, as they only concern men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have a long half-life, so their effects on health can be known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years after contact with plant protection products.
In a press release, Rodriguez stated: "After 34 years of male observation, the relationship between pesticide exposure and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant".
This was probably because the factors associated with ageing became more important, which masked the possible causal/effectal relationship between the exposure to pesticides and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases in later years of life.
Researchers have not found a significant relationship between exposure to small to moderate amounts of plant protection products and increased risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone conversation Zelyński-Trump: Poroshenko adds three cents
Waszyngton's policy is having a turbulent week in the process of impeachment against US President Donald Trump.
Getting involved in a political scandal is for the political debutant Volodymyr Zelenski, a situation he would prefer to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zelenski-Trump affair and will it have far-reaching implications for the first one?
Almost at the start of the call, Trump told Zielenko that the United States was doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not complete, they describe in detail Trump's attack on German Chancellor Angela Merkel for the fact that the German leaders and other European leaders are engaged in negotiations rather than making concrete proposals.
The controversy raised the answer of Zelenski, who said that he agreed with Trump not 100%, but 1000%.
Zelenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views has led politicians, especially from the Ukrainian opposition, to decide to speak through social networks.
Petro Poroshenko, the former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that EU support was "unprecedented".
In other tweets, Poroshenko said he was grateful for the EU's "Russian aggression" support, which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including the Ukrainian politician Victoria Voytsitska said: “How can we talk to Germany and France now? ”
Trump then mentioned military aid and asked Zelenski to investigate not in one and two cases: the first concerning Joe Biden-Hunter's son and the second relating to breaking into the DNS server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in a hacking attack on the Democratic e-mail boxes during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether this will damage European relations or break relations with the leader of France and Germany.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank all those who help us" - he said after the publication of the Zełyński telephone call in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zelenski is due to meet the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming summit of the "Norway Four", which is due to take place in October.
Former regional inspector of the right of acquittal
The court cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski of the alleged acts.
After 6 years, Jerzy Wiśniewski was finally cleared of the charges.
The District Court in Przemyśl has cleared Jerzy Wiśniewski, former Head of the Regional Quality Inspectorate of Agricultural and Food Articles in Rzeszów, of overrun of powers.
The Lublin D.A. accused him that he was to betray to the then Marshal of the voivodeship the term of control at the food oil production plant.
The case has recently been adjudicated by a valid acquittal.
The appeal was recognized on 12 September.
“The Court of Justice has maintained the judgment under appeal,” confirms Judge Małgorzata Reizer, Advocate of the District Court in Przemyśl.
It is a judgment of 14 February this year issued by the District Court in Przemyśl.
Jerzy Wiśniewski then commented on Facebook: “It’s been six years since I was presented by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in Lublin with the alleged violation of the law in a phone call to the Marshal of the Podkarpacki Region on 30 April 2012.
The court unequivocally stated that I was innocent and that I had not broken the law at that time.
I was convinced that my phone conversation with the Marshal of the Podkarpacki Region was in accordance with the applicable law.
The version of the events that the media described in 2013 by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin passed with the truth and caused irreversible damage to both the food manufacturer's business and the loss of the image of my person with my employers, employees and the local community.
The indictment file against me in the Court's opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, untrue indications of the legal basis, unconfirmed events.
With the help of CBA in Rzeszów, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately dismissed from work and deprived of financial resources.
I stayed for a long time to keep my wife."
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wiśniewski served as the voivodship inspector for the quality of trade in agri-food products between 2009 and 2013.
He was dismissed from office after the prosecutor's office in Lublin presented charges in 2013.
According to the investigators, in the telephone conversation he was to betray the then Marshal of the voivodeship (Mirosław Karapata was sentenced to four years of imprisonment) the term of control at the food oil production plant belonging to the wife of the then Deputy Marshal of the Podkarpacki.
This warning, as the Lublin prosecutors claimed, meant that the owner of the company knew about the controls and adjusted the labels on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wiśniewski heard charges of overrun, for which he was threatened to be released for up to three years.
"I feel relieved that this case has finally come to an end and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now the final confirmation of a judgment acquitted me from the accusations," comments Jerzy Wiśniewski.
The White House tried to hide the record of a conversation with Zelenski
In a report released on Thursday, the signalist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking to the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zełenski, sought to intervene a foreign state in the US elections, and the White House tried to hide the record of this conversation.
Presidents of Ukraine and the USA
In an anonymous report dated 12 August, an interviewer, who is probably an interviewer, wrote: “As part of my duties, I was informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president used his function to demand the intervention of a foreign country in the elections in the United States in 2020. ”
“Trump has used part of the conversation (with Zelenski) to pursue its own interests.
Exactly – he tried to push the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president in his re-election in 2020, says the report, quoted by the newspaper "The Hill".
The Ukrainian leader was "intelligible" that the contacts with Trump depended on whether he would "be willing to play" in matters that were more specifically to be informed by President Ruda Giuliani's lawyer.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but stresses that he was informed in detail of its content by “many officials of the White House who had direct information on the subject” and their relations overlaped.
“In the days following this conversation, I learned from many American officials that high-ranking representatives of the White House intervened to “seal” all the archived records of this conversation, and in particular the literal record that has been written, as is usually done, in the White House’s crisis room,” we read on.
“High-ranking White House officials told me that the White House lawyers “made them” to remove electronic records from the IT system in which such records are stored.
The record was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate sensitive information", wrote the author of the report.
"In my opinion, these steps show that the White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," said the signaler.
As AP comments, this document will probably expedite the proceedings on the possible impeachment of the President, and also contains valuable information about witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
He made the interview with the Green White House, after the pressures of Congress, available on Wednesday, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationships of the people who witnessed it.
The content of the report, as edited, was revealed a day later by the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee.
On Thursday, Joseph Maguire also testified before the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee and explained how he treated the intelligence report.
Maguire said that the signaler made the right choice and did as the law commands.
He also stressed that, in his opinion, the issue of speaking with Zelenski is an event "without precedent".
The Democrats in the intelligence committee asked Maguire why he blocked the release of the signal report to Congress; the director of the interview replied that he had no authority to disclose its content, whose confidential nature guarantees the so-called privilege of the executive authority.
Part of Maguire's interrogation by the committee took place behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, announced that, in view of the suspicion that the President had put pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm his potential rival in the next presidential election, the House of Representatives is launching an investigation that could lead to Trump's impeachment.
A day later, she estimated that Trump's record of a conversation with Zelenski confirmed that the President of the United States had broken the standards of election and security.
Electoral law in the US prohibits the use of foreign state aid.
On Thursday, the spokesperson of the White House, Stephanie Grisham, said that there was nothing wrong in the conversation, and in the report, "there is nothing more than a set of reports with a third hand and a bonded press release".
"The White House will continue to criticise this hysteria of the media and the false narrative promoted by the mainstream media," she added.
Ghana wins two ICAO awards
Ghana won two prestigious awards during the 40th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) in Montreal, Canada.
The safety prize was awarded to show that Ghana received the highest number of air safety oversight points in Africa, i.e. 89.89 percent in terms of the temporary effective implementation rate (EI).
It occurred when ICAO concluded its control of the ICVM on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the Universal Audit Programme of the United Nations Aviation Agency.
The Security Prize demonstrated the recognition of the country's high involvement in the implementation of ICAO's recommended security standards and protocols at airports and in Ghana.
The award programme was designed to provide support to the ICAO initiative No Country Left Behind.
In addition, 16 other safety certificates and 17 security certificates were granted to ICAO Member States that improved their safety and security standards.
During the award for Ghana, the Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of Ghana Civil Aviation Office, Simon Allotey, Ambassador of Ghana in Canada, Nii Ayikoi Otoo and Managing Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
President of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, Olumuyiva Benard Aliu, in his speech stressed the need for Member States to maintain safety in the airspace.
He said: "It is important that we keep in mind that even in the age of innovation aviation safety and sustainable development must remain our core priorities".
For his part, Mr Adda noted that the prizes were a huge achievement for the efforts of the state, because they are a compliment for the hard work and perseverance of the industry.
He added that the aviation industry has a huge potential for developing the economy of the country, saying: “Airspace has powerful opportunities to change our lives.
These are socio-economic benefits, but everything is due to the security and security that we have achieved."
LOCATION: Refueled and escaped, and stole the bike
50-year-old from the municipality of Zamość drove up his audi under the distributor, refueled and left without payment.
That's how he robbed gas stations a couple of times.
A man also stole a bicycle from one of the overseas offices a month ago.
The owners of the petrol stations valued their losses for almost 1 thousand PLN.
Owner of stolen bike – for 2 thousand zlotys.
Last Tuesday, one of the Zamość districts noticed an audi on Wyszyńskiego Street, whose owner was suspected of theft.
There was just a 50-year-old wanted behind the wheel.
A man was arrested in police custody.
On Thursday he heard charges of the theft of four petrol stations and a bicycle.
He confessed to committing these crimes.
The uniforms also found the stolen bike.
The unity will soon return to the owner.
For theft, a thief is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as FEMA's boss: White House
Peter Gaynor, the administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles at the meeting of the Senate's National Security Subcommittee on the FEMA's budgetary proposal for the financial year 2020 at the Capitolian Hill in Washington, USA on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday, US President Donald Trump nominated Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, the deputy administrator of FEMA, is the head of the agency who oversees a government response to disasters such as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency operated without an administrator approved by the US Senate since March when Brock Long fired this post.
Long after the US Department of National Security, which is subject to FEMA, stated that Long had used government vehicles to drive between Washington and his house in North Carolina in an inappropriate way.
Another candidate for this post, Jeffrey Byard, was withdrawn earlier this month when a thorough examination of his past revealed that he had been in a bar fight.
Gaynor's nomination for this job was expected.
To approve his nomination for this role, a majority in the Senate will be required.
The White House announced that before Gaynor became FEMA's deputy administrator in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the Marine Corps.
Henrik Ingebrigtsen, Norwegian runner, considering finger amputation
The 28-year-old runner specialized in a distance of 1500 meters, winning a gold European Championship in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also European Deputy Mayor at 5000 meters from 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that this was not a new ailment and that he had already had one operation immediately after the 2016 Games, but the pain returned and this season became very intense.
The pain makes me put my foot down, which in turn changes my body system, there are other unnatural burdens and I start to feel pain in other places, for example in the weather.
For this reason, I could not prepare for the world championships enough, and for two weeks the pain has been so strong that I have difficulty setting up spikes – said the runner on the air of the NRK channel.
The father and coach of Gjert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with their son, they concluded that the only solution not to finish his career and participate in the next year's Olympic Games in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems that this is the only, although drastic, and the decision has already been made.
"If a part of the body hurts, it should be disposed of, and Henrik does not need this finger so much, and in this situation it should be forgotten about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
The police are closing down an illegal e-papero factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday, police closed an illegal e-papero factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
The office building on 9600 Telstar Avenue about 16:37 was raided, during which police were searching for illegals intended for the sale of e-paperos containing marijuana and during which large jars containing butane hashish oil were found – concentrate from cannabis.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police Department, the officers also found a device that was used to supplement the limestones.
"This process is very dangerous," he says.
Cano, who used to work on drugs, says that the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially flammable process.
"The ordinary electrostatic spark from our clothes can cause the ignition of these fumes, causing not only fire, but also explosions because of concentration, even" he says.
"If we have many jars in the room and similar ones, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only a fire, but also an explosion that could wipe the whole complex off the surface.
A special task force was called to the office to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
At the moment, the value of confiscated products and equipment is not known.
Detectives say they received an anonymous tip that allowed them to get a search warrant to detect illegal activity.
Investigators are still trying to find out who's behind this illegal business.
According to them, the responsible person set up a business in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and the officers want to make sure that illegal products are not on the street, given the recent articles on limestone damage.
"People don't really know what products they're buying," says Cano.
"They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our communities and children, so we always keep them from reaching for this kind of thing.
Aphtin withdrawn from the market.
GIF has decided on a medicine for moulds
The Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate informed that the medicine had been withdrawn from the market for oral infections.
Aphtin is a medicine used to treat moulds and yeast infections of the mouth, infections with Gram-positive bacteria.
It can also be used auxiliaryly to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product has been withdrawn due to non-compliant product quality specifications and a decrease in the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galen Laboratory in Olsztyn.
On average, every month GIF makes a few decisions to withdraw individual series of products from the market.
A series of medicines withheld in Poland may be reintroduced after evidence of safety has been presented.
This is not possible if the medicine is withdrawn.
Banknot 19 zł – where to buy a collector’s banknote about this denomination?
It has 19 zlotys and has the image of Ignacy Jan Paderewski.
At the beginning of October a new collector's banknote will be introduced – he informed the National Bank of Poland.
It's another "independence" bill.
It is to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Polish Securities Factory.
As described in the NBP communication, Ignacy Jan Paderewski will be presented at the bank.
The date placed on the bank on 25 January 2019 is the date on which the 100th anniversary of the PWPW was established.
Also nominal value, 19 PLN, is a reference to the year of creation of the Factory" - reads the NBP communication.
The watermark presents the image of the eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after regaining independence.
The new one is the holographic belt located on the window in the ground.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski and next to the inscription "independent" was presented the stylized image of the order of the White Eagle.
This inscription, illustrated from the manuscript of Józef Piłsudski, is a logo of 100th anniversary of Poland regaining independence.
A security developed by PWPW - Umbra4Note, a special form of angle effect, was incorporated into the laurel branch, symbolizing brotherhood and victory.
On the reverse side of the banknote there is the image of the building of the factory against the background of the panorama of modern Warsaw.
Next to it is built into the logo PWPW protection SPARK Live and the opalescent strip, visible also in UV light in the form of repeated numbers "19" and the short "NBP" - describes NBP.
The bill is due to be put into circulation on 2 October by up to 55 000 units.
One bill will cost 80 zlotys.
All coins and banknotes issued by NBP, including those of the special series, are legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than that which can be achieved on the collector’s market.
The new owner bought it for $500,000, which is more than two million zlotys, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown, Maryland.
The house was transported on a special platform to Easton port where it was loaded onto a barge.
From there, he passed the river 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczyński will vote for Małgorzata Gosiewska
President of PiS Jarosław Kaczyński will give his voice to Małgorzata Gosiewska in the upcoming elections.
"I'm asking you to do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczyński, together with Małgorzata Gosiewska, posed for the photograph of the baner candidate PiS.
On Friday, Warsaw's "Tree" praised the social media that she would win Kaczyński's vote in the parliamentary elections.
"Priest of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczyński supports Małgorzata Gosiewska", we read on her Facebook profile.
The party leader pointed out that she is a sensitive, emotional person and always ready to bring help.
"I will cast my vote on Margaret Gosiewska and ask for the same," he appeals.
Gosiewska is running for Sejm from the 19th district (Warsaw) and third place on the list.
"One" is Kaczyński himself, and Mariusz Kamiński is second.
Here comes the Christmas Book Fair.
We have meetings with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We are here to break the stereotypes.
The people of Podkarpacia are said not to read books.
We'll show that it's different," she said at a press conference, Marta Halfctor.
And who will support reading in Rzeszow this year?
As we have heard, there will be a sister Anastasia at the fair, called the first chef of the Republic of Poland, as well as: Łukasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Ćwiek.
This autumn, the Millennium Hall will host a great cultural event – on 22 and 23 November, the 3rd edition of the Christmas Book Fair, one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting editions of publishing and bookellers from all over Poland will come to the fair.
There will be as many as 30 of them, including Agora, Sign, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions they will present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of book novelties, which participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
What's more, there will be special meetings with writers during the two days of the fair.
This time, authors were invited to write about important issues and are not afraid to take on difficult topics, and are also the winners of prestigious awards and... they cook well.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At the moment, participation in the fair was confirmed, among others, by Łukasz Orbitowski – the laureate of the political passport, Janusz Leon Wiśniewski, the author of the best-seller "Salomnost in the Network", and the queen of the Polish crime scene: Katarzyna Bonda.
The star of this year's fair will be Sister Anastasia, author of several books (including chefs), which have sold in more than 4 million copies.
Exhibition of the missing dress Elizabeth I in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver threaded dress made of the finest silk camper was embellished with embellishments representing vegetation, animals and butterflies.
For Eleri Lynn, the curator of the Historical Royal Palaces Foundation exhibition, it meant only one thing.
The bleached fabric hanging from the wall of the tiny parish church she was looking at for 100 years could only be a missing part of Elizabeth I's wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn accidentally encountered a prominent altar fabric in Bacton, Herefordshire, the missing dress of Elizabeth is to be found next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same rooms where the Tudor Dynasty queen could wear it more than 450 years ago.
The measure of the importance of this discovery is that from the entire collection of royal dresses only one more element of the XVI-century dress survived.
Although there is no clear evidence that Elizabeth ever wore this dress, three years of research has strengthened experts in the belief that she had to be part of the royal wardrobe.
"Silver", an incredibly expensive fabric, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal court, and the virtual quality of embroidered plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen and bears, indicates that the dress belonged to the greatest of people.
The dress, at the time it was sewn, could have cost the equivalent of the Tudor estate.
"What's more, in the 1990s, that is, at the end of Elizabeth's reign, she felt a danger from other women outside and would not tolerate rivals who wear such fine fabrics," Lynn says.
"As a very important statement, I asked many people from the environment to look at the dress.
I was really glad to see the dress, too, and they were almost convinced that we had an element in the royal wardrobe.
A long, re-life dress, cut to serve as an altar fabric in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is a settlement from which Blanche Parry, the nearest Elizabeth, was the lady of the court, who served the queen for her long life and with whom in local legends the fabric was identified.
Although the dress was created after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elizabeth had to give it to the Parra family or parish to Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, four hundred of which took place on the gentlest hand sewn with specially dyed silk and thin surgical needles, the altar fabric will reach the exhibition next to the Hatfield House's "Rainbow Portrait" palace, one of the most famous paintings of Elizabeth's day, dressed in a similar dress.
"When working with historical fabrics, the craftsmanship of the people who made them really begins to be respected," says Libby Thompson, head of conservation work, whose most of them took place in a processed greenhouse at Hampton Court Palace – the only place to accommodate some of the priceless palace tapestrys.
“Looking at the embroidery at the front and back, I began to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on anything so elite.
The exhibition "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" will start on October 12 at Hampton Court
Fitch confirmed the Polish rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed the long-term rating of Poland in the foreign currency at "A-" level on Friday, as stated in the Communication.
The rating outlook remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic foundations and a well-diversified economy, which is supported by a sound economic policy and a strong banking sector," says the Ministry of Finance.
Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the economic cycle and that in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of the Gross National Product in Poland would be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency forecasts that the general government deficit to GDP in the period 2020-2021 will remain below the 3% limit, 2.3% and 1.9% respectively.
“The government debt ratio to GDP in 2019 will be 50,5 per cent according to the Agency, and in subsequent years it will be less (on average 48,3 per cent in the period 2020-2020)”, we read.
Polish Rating
The autumn round of reviews of the Polish rating will be completed on 11 October by S&P and Moody's.
The Polish Rating in the evaluation of Fitch remains the same as issued at the end of March 2019.
The Agency then confirmed the "A-" rating of Poland with a stable perspective.
Of the three largest credit rating agencies, Poland's creditworthiness is best assessed by Moody's – "A2" level.
The Polish rating according to Fitch and S&P is "A-", one level lower than Moody's.
The prospects of all evaluations are stable.
What is a rating?
Credit rating agencies are created to help investors assess the risk scale of their investment activities.
Rating is granted to companies, banks and countries.
For the latter, each assessment translates into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing more than credit rating.
On the basis of it, decisions are made about who and how much to borrow money.
Sometimes such information suggests who best not to give any credit at all, because there is a great risk that the money will not be recovered.
A lower rating involves a higher risk.
In turn, higher risk is high interest on credit.
Each assessment must be justified and established.
Rating can be manipulated, but in this case, agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the world's rating market is controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them applies its own rating system.
"Fifth of the Confederacy": First 1000 plus
The "Fifth of the Confederacy", the main objectives of the electoral programme, were presented by candidates from the 40 Sejm in Koszalin, applying for a mandate from the list of KW, the Confederation of Freedom and Independence.
Krzysztof Chmielewski, the leader of Koszalin's letter to the Sejm, presented the slogans "Fifth of the Confederation".
"First of all, the 1000-plus program for Poland, secondly the quick and fair courts, thirdly the cultural bon and educational bon, fourthly the national security, fifthly it is a healthy life," said Chmielewski.
He pointed out that "the Poles must finally start earning money", which is why the Confederacy wants to liquidate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with the tax-free amount will solve itself".
"The Poles need to be given a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, i.e. zero PIT and voluntary ZUS for all", said the leader of the list about the assumption of "the 1000 plus program for Poland".
On the other hand, Aleksandra Zadenck, who started the second place of the list, referring to the programme slogan "healthy life", said that "food is becoming worse and that in order to change this, it is necessary to "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture", to act in favour of GMO-free crops.
As she said, the Confederacy also advocates the end of the "stigmatisation of hemp".
Zadencka declared its support to the Confederacy for the "development of construction using natural raw materials".
She also expressed her support for "voluntary vaccinations" on behalf of her group.
"The right to informed consent must not be violated," she added.
Other candidates from the Koszalin district stressed that the Confederacy was in favour of a "deep reform of the judiciary", which should be part of, among other things, the examination of the case by the judge "day-by-day".
They also advocated that educational subsidies should go to schools without the intermediation of local authorities, i.e., in their view, without additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The Confederation is also in favour of "a strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The candidates for the Sejm stressed the need to increase the number of the army.
According to them, easier access to weapons is also needed.
On economic issues, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can gase coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, we also need to consider going back to the idea of a nuclear power plant," said Piotr Karpiński on the election list.
The head of the Mexican cartel is behind a third of the drugs in the U.S.
Chicago – Just after sunrise, on the West Side in Chicago, CBS News reported a morning drug chase.
Brian McKnight from the D.E.A. has shown in full light what's going on.
In Chicago last year, nearly 800 people died of an overdose.
McKnight said "probably 90%" of the drugs in Chicago came from Mexico.
The DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantes, simply known as El Mencho.
“He is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for the US Federal Executive Authorities,” said Matthew Donahue, the DEA’s chief agent in Mexico.
El Mencho's prize goes to $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of drug labs located in the jungle El Mencho.
A member of El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generation, or CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs reaching the US via land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel smuggled "tons" of cocaine, meth and heroin contaminated with fentanyl.
There's a $10 million prize waiting for El Mencho's head.
Ironically, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug charges and finally deported to Mexico.
That's where he created the brutal cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPG, weapons of caliber 50.
In principle, he owns his own SWAT teams", added Donahue.
El Mencho protects his empire with impunity by means such as shooting down a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or taking part in public hanging this summer.
In recent years, cartel brutality has led to thousands of murders.
According to the Mexican government's statistics, there are approximately 94 murders every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic, they can't be handled without protective equipment.
In the lab, a bag of cocaine is called a smuggler's brand.
For more than a third of them, traces lead to the El Mencho cartel.
"He is responsible for sending poison that kills innocent women and children," Donahue said.
So when someone's child dies, Donahue says there's a "big chance" that the drugs come from the El Mencho organization.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died of overdose.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed the President of France and his wife
A 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady, says the French prosecutor.
The defendant assures that he has documents that compromise the presidential couple.
He asked the Head of State, among others, for EUR 300,000 in the ready-made.
A man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work in the police in France claims to have received “explosion” documents from a person employed in the Elisha Palace.
During the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but the disclosure of them in its entirety could put Macron and the first lady of France at risk.
In exchange for their return, he demanded EUR 300,000 – he also wanted to get an apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters in the previous marriage.
According to the D.A.'s office, the defendant refused to hand over the documents he was talking about to the police.
He announced that he would pass it on to the media – but it is not yet known whether these documents really exist.
They weren't found in that 27-year-old's apartment at the time of the search.
A man was subjected to psychiatric examination, but his doctors found no serious disorders.
PS4 will be an old-fashioned game – Sony reveals surprising facts about PlayStation 4
Sony sheds more light on the soon-to-deposit game available exclusively on PS4 The Last of Us: Part Two.
Sony announced as part of a recent State of Play presentation that the premiere of the sequel The Last of Us would be held in February 2020.
Fans could also see a new piece of breathtaking gameplay from the upcoming action game.
Even more specifics were revealed in the days after the final part of The Last of Us 2 was released.
And it looks like Sony and Naughty Dog are reaching for old-school climates in many ways.
Something has been decided that we haven't seen much since PS 1. The Last of Us: Part 2 will be sold on several tiles.
Neil Druckmann of Naughty Dog confirmed this in a sensational interview by The Telegraph, explaining that the sequel has grown into one of the most extensive games in history.
"The story is ambitious and intricate in aspects where one was not," he said.
It must have been so extensive to be able to present this kind of story with so many characters.
We weren't going to create the most extensive game, that's just what happened.
"We're excited about how many possibilities are hidden in this story. There will be moments when you think you're going to finish, but you'll realize that it's just the beginning and that a whole new chapter is starting," Dr.
It's such an ambitious game that it didn't fit on one BluRayu and it's on two tiles.
The Last of Us: Part Two contains one or two easter egos with adult content (the information given by Gamespot).
We will not spoil the surprises, but the emerging in the game edge egos refer to the old Naughty Dog works.
You will learn more when The Last of Us: Part Two debuts on the PS4 only on 21 February 2020.
People with PS4 can prepare for the sequel premiere, reaching for The Last of Us Remastered available in PS Plus.
Sony recently announced a list of free PS4 games offered since October 2019 by PlayStation Plus, among which is the above mentioned production of Naughty Dog.
PS Plus subscribers will also have access to the MLB The Show 19 from October.
If you like The Last of Us Remastered and want to place a pre-premier order for the sequel, Sony said that there will be many versions of the game, including an exclusive edition containing a replica of Ella's backpack and its bracelets and a 30-inch figure of this iconic figure.
Run, rip and fight - Sport
On Saturday, the first-round Stomil will take Podbeskid and want to win.
The Stomila players have been invincible for three rounds.
Piotr Zajądzkowski's carers scored seven points at that time because they won with Stala Mielec and Chojnice Chojnice, and in the last match there was a goalless draw in Suwałki.
Now the Olsztyn team will take Podbeskid on Saturday at 6 p.m., which is listed as one of the favorites for promotion to Extraklasy.
The closest rivals of Stomil take the fourth place in the table and have the advantage of the team from Olsztyn.
Podbeskidy played six times this season and won two victories, draw and defeat, while Stomil feels very well at his place – at the stadium at Piłsudski Street 69a, the team won three times and once lost.
In total, ten rounds of alms have gathered 17 points and are at the forefront of the table, although after two failures at the start of the game, nothing had announced it.
"Every change takes time for results," explains Piotr Skiba.
"And finally something's gone wrong with us, we believe in ourselves, and we can work under normal conditions.
We're just focusing on the ball game.
They're clean heads, there's a good atmosphere, and everyone knows what to do, because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, the footballers of Stomil eliminated the Chorzów movement from the Polish Cup, but they needed extras and a series of criminal throws.
Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not go to the south of Poland, because coach Zająckowski gave these key players a rest before the Saturday fight with Podbeskid.
On the other hand, Jakub Mosakowski, who returned to Chorzów after injury, finally scored his long-awaited goal.
"It's always fun to get a goal, and I'm still at a moment where we can still play cups (Mosakowski made it 3:3 in 119 minutes - red.).
My dad used to bite me a lot and laugh that I couldn't get a goal, and I always told him I'd shoot him at the moment he didn't expect him to."
Now Mosakowski is counting on a return to the basic composition, especially because of the yellow cards he cannot play Oleh Tarasenko.
"For this I work hard at trainings to be able to play in the first composition," says Mosakowski.
“In Chorzów I did my best to present myself.
But whether I'm playing or sitting on the bench, I'm going to support the band as much as I do.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the match with Podbeskid.
Surely we will have a hard meeting in which the victory will have to run out, rip and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztyn defense, Rafał Remis can still play, which has recently also been injured, so whether or not he will not know until Saturday, especially since coach Zajączkowski traditionally tries to keep personal affairs a secret until the end.
A man raped and murdered his niece
"You'll never see the light of day.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, addressing Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so disgusting and mean that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzie disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple indicated the location of the body.
"How could anyone do this to his own niece?" asked Dejay Smith, the girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," he said to Alexa Whipple.
"I would give anything to meet her again, hug her," said the mother of the murdered girl.
"Our life will never be the same," added a crushed woman.
According to Fox News, 22-year-old Whipple showed no emotion during the interrogation.
Last month, he admitted that he kidnapped, sexually abused and murdered a girl.
A man's lawyer said his client grew up in a "imperfect family".
He was supposed to be molested as a child.
He added that Whipple was aware that he had committed a terrible act and was willing to suffer punishment.
A man was sentenced to life without the possibility of applying for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced that he will hand over nearly $100 million extra funds to communities affected by drought.
The programme providing money for farmers affected by the drought will be extended and the criteria for allocating allowances to farms will be simplified.
The aid package includes almost $34 million for the support initiative for the affected communities, so that eligible farms can receive up to $3,000 in an emergency.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the programme will receive up to $1 million of infrastructure grants and assistance in dealing with the consequences of the disaster.
The new support package is an addition to over 7 billion dollars spent by the government to the drought fund.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
Documentary film: In China, divorce rates have doubled in the last decade.
In general, third parties were responsible for this situation.
More and more men maintain out of marriage, which has led to the development of a particular industry in this country – professional slayers of lovers, who are responsible for saving the marriage of betrayed wives.
Let's scan out loud: Ma-te-ear!
An attempt to welcome the Prime Minister to the Silesian Piekary
A special general test was conducted before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki in Piekary Śląskie.
"Ladies, louder, louder, we will not welcome you to the Prime Minister here!
Let us scan loudly: Ma-te-ear!", he encouraged the guide.
Unfortunately, the enthusiast efforts of the chief have not produced the expected result.
Electoral campaign in progress.
Politicians drive all over the country, convincing voters.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is the leader of the Silesian list of PiS, is also conducting an intensive campaign.
Each meeting is carefully planned, including the right frame.
It was, or rather, supposed to be, in the Silesian Piekars.
Known – special guest should be greeted especially.
Before the meeting with the Prime Minister, the host decided to conduct a general test.
Like a dry leader, he tried to encourage the crowd to chant the name of the head of government.
"This will not be a welcome for me, but for Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki!
And louder, my dear ones!", he encouraged the distensives.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not completely kidnapped by the hot message of the leader and was reluctant to respond to the "Ma-te-ear", but the recording of the enthusiastic leader is doing a lot of fun on the web.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of the murder of Stephen and Katie Stay in 2014 and four of their five children in Spring, Texas.
According to the authorities, he entered the House of Stay on 9 July 2014, requesting that his wife, Melanie Haskell, be disclosed with whom he was separated.
She wasn't there, but there was her sister, Katie Stay, and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, were killed when Haskell opened fire, according to the Harris Sheriff' Office.
Only one family member survived, 15 years old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said she was badly injured, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, jury members rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of insanity.
The jury will meet again on Monday to deliver the sentence.
Quantum Internet Getting Closer to Reality – ScienceDaily
The results of the U.S. Army research are moving the quantum Internet one step closer.
Such an internet could offer military capabilities in terms of security, detection and accuracy of time not available with a traditional approach to networking.
The Center for the Dispersed Quantum Processing of Military Information of the Research Laboratory for the Development of the American Army's Fighting Capacity was looking at researchers from the University of Insbruck, who managed to achieve a record state transfer of confusion between matter and light – at a distance of 50 kilometres with optical cables.
Confusion is a correlation that can arise between quantums such as cubs.
When two cubs are confused and measured one of them, this will have an impact on the measurements made on the other, even if the second cub is physically remote.
"These [50 km] are two rows of size further than previously possible and this is a feasible distance to the start of construction of intercity quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist from the University of Innsbruck and a major researcher in the project, which was published in the magazine Nature, Section Quantum Information.
The intercity quantum networks would consist of distant nodes of physical cubs, which are tangled together despite a long physical distance.
The researchers found that this dispersion of the confused state is essential for the creation of a quantum Internet.
"This demonstration is a major step forward in order to achieve a large-scale dissipated state," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-chairing a military programme supporting this research.
The quality of the tangled state at the other end is also high enough to meet some of the most difficult applications of quantum networks.
The research team began an experiment with calcium atom trapped in an ion trap.
Using laser beams, researchers entered a quantum state in the ion, at the same time arousing it to emit a photon in which quantum information was stored.
As a result, quantum states of the atom and particles of light have been confused.
The challenge is to send a photon with a fiber optic cable.
"The photo emitted by calcium ion has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is rapidly absorbed by the fibre", said Lanyon.
That's why his band originally sent a piece of light through a nonlinear crystal illuminated by a powerful laser ray.
The photon wave length has been converted to an optimal value for long distance transmission – the current standard telecom wavelength is 1550 nanometers.
Then the researchers sent this photon over a 50-kilometre fiber optic cable.
Their measurements show that the atom and the particles of light were still confused even after the transformation of the wavelength and the passage of that distance.
"The decision to choose calcium means that this result sets a direct path for the creation of a confused network of atomic clocks over long physical distances, as calcium can be associated with a high-quality cubata.
The army is very much interested in confused large-scale clock networks due to its application for precise positioning, precise navigation and time synchronisation," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-manages the program.
