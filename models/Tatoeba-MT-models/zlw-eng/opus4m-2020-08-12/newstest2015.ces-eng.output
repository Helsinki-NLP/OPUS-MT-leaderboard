Petr Čech: Last minute transfer?
Anything is possible
Today is the last day when you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transition.
Another chance won't come until winter.
Petr Čech, currently a substitute goaltender for Chelsea, does not sit over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the hotel, talking to Czech journalists and is preparing with the Czech representation for a game general with Americans and then also for a sharp start of Euro 2016 qualifications against the Netherlands.
In the goal of Chelsea, the Premier League takes priority Thibaut Courtois in the new season, and the Czech Republic has first entered the position of an alternate in London club in ten years.
Some time ago, it was speculated that the Czechs might be interested in Real Madrid.
He lost the Spanish Supercup in a fight against Atlétik at the beginning of the season and failed to even enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastian.
The interest of Paris SG was also speculated.
That was two wins and two draws until the French League season, and he fired St. Etienne 5:0 on Sunday.
Relatively the most pressing shoe club AS Monaco.
He's got a 1-1-2 balance in the league so far, and he broke up with Lille at 1:1 on the weekend.
On the tabloid English websites today, news came out that the Czechs might want to go to Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, but Bohemia's departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet wrote course 4:1 on him.
Peter, is it possible that you can change your uniform in the next few hours?
I don't count on it, but there's never a hundred percent in football.
Maybe in the course of the day, there'll be an offer that won't be refused.
What would such an offer have to look like?
(Laughter) "Well, I don't know how such an offer that can't be rejected actually looks like.
It would have to be the agreement of all parties. First of all, it would have to be Chelsea's position whether or not the club would be dealing with a possible offer.
Is it technically feasible to do such a transfer now that you are in Prague?
Wouldn't you need to sign a new contract somewhere in the new workplace?
I didn't think about it that way.
But there's a lot of players in this situation today, and everyone's out there at representation meetings, and I'm sure there's a lot of redeployment going on today.
So somehow it would be realistic.
How many clubs on the planet that could afford you?
I really don't know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
The situation when I didn't catch the new season in the first three games is new to me after 15 years of my career.
However, there's no reason to panic, pack and go somewhere.
I want to continue this fight for goalie Chelsea's position, and it's up to the coach to whom he chooses, what decisions he'll make over the next few weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, it is a sporting aspect for me, but I also look at it from a personal website, which, of course, includes the needs of the family.
Is it possible you could catch another club in England?
That's a question I never thought I'd be concerned about.
But anything is possible in football.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Presidents of the Government of India and Japan for a meeting in Tokyo
The new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Ab. He is to discuss economic and security commitments for his first bigger visit since May's election victory.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic ties with the third largest world economy.
The list includes first and foremost plans for more extensive cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to the rapporteurs, India also hopes that both nations will agree to cooperate on defence issues.
Carrat police arrested a 20-year-old young man after a motorcycle chase
They stopped the bike after the maximum permitted speed of 70 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the police.
The guarding traffic police in Carrata tried to stop a blue motorcycle at the curb this morning when they noticed that it was going 125 km/h at the exit from the gas station on Bathgate Road.
According to the police, the driver didn't stop and continue on Burgess Road and then turn him into a bush, so the cops lost sight of him.
The motorbike and the person who matched the driver's description were then seen in a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
The Carrath police accused a 20-year-old boy of disobeying a call for stopping and reckless management.
The Carrata trial will be September 23rd.
The bike was for three months confiscated.
George Webster accused of rape at hotels in Nairn and Pitlochy
A man will be brought to trial for rape charges against women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was informed of the charge during a hearing at the Glasgow Supreme Court.
Supposedly he had raped a woman on June 7, 2013 at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochy County, Perthshire.
Webster claimed to have attacked her, while “she was unconscious, asleep, and unable to give her consent.”
In addition, Webster is being prosecuted for rape of another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set a trial date for 17 November at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Renewing the very American ideal that labour rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect the union as a civil law.
"The way unions work, middle-class jobs work," said Ellison, Democratic Senator for Minnesota, co-chairman of the Congress Committee.
That's why I'm so proud to be able to introduce a law that strengthens the status of employees along with the model of occasional rights of John Lewis.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal possibilities as to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions, as in other forms of discrimination - and stop the anti-union forces
Adjust the Labour Relations Act so as to allow all workers who face discrimination, if they want to participate in trade unions, to sue in a civil court - and to judge compensation or compensation - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it certainly is not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and other law-makers are proposing is to reconnect with the American ideal.
Despite the trade unions in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, extend and respect labour rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them when the country breathed to promote democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to gather.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toja's military autcracy is replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that employees and their trade unions were playing a role in shaping new Japan, including language, and openly acknowledged that "the right of employees to gather, to negotiate and to act collectively is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers encouraged the Germans to establish a constitution to ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism is replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to be organized and enforced in the new nation, and they therefore included a clause that says openly: “The right to create associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each individual and to each profession or profession.
Arrangements which will restrict or seek damage to this right shall be repealed. Measures leading to the fulfilment of such a purpose shall be unlawful.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, the applicants and Roosevelt guaranteed that "everyone has the right to create and enter the trade unions in the protection of their interests."
The Americans have accepted the basic premium of working rights as human rights for generations.
When the countries advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to create labour unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as an equal partner - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being invaded in America, it is definitely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organise and enforce in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a big teacher.
Today, everyone knows that the union has not reduced the power of the nation, but has expanded it.
They have increased the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and production to an unknown level.
Those who invade the union forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History doesn't forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human - and the extension of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is very late.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that raised America and made it a true promise of democracy.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
The federal judge temporarily blocked the Louisiana law on Sunday, which, according to lawyers, would probably close all five abortion clinics in the state.
A regulation, which was entered into force on 1 September by the signature of the Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which is due to enter into force on 1 September, would require the abortion practitioners to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The order of the judge means that doctors may temporarily continue to carry out legal abortions and, in the meantime, must obtain such permission.
"The proposing party will be able to carry out its activities legally and, in the meantime, obtain a permit," says federal judge John deGravelles.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for the right to abortion, which is the last in a series of similar measures, welcomed and said that they would give doctors more time to obtain permission.
"Today's decision assures women in Louisiana that they will be safe from the misguided law to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, sought to block the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision concerns doctors from two clinics that were not among the plaintiffs and also applied for the authorisation.
Louisiana is among the eleven countries which have passed similar laws, and the courts in Alabama and Mississippi have declared such measures unconstitutional.
The key parts of the Texas Law that would close most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the rights of women to abortion together with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association claim that the need to have this authorisation imposes medical requirements that are not medically necessary.
The opponents opposed abortion by seeking to protect the health of women, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The reproductive rights centre stated that in Louisiana only one doctor performing abortions has a permit.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop miscarriage, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure because of his fear of safety, said the group.
In response, the Louisiana authorities stated that they would not punish the physicians who perform abortions while waiting for the requests for rights to be dealt with.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, he kills ovaries in rural cancer more often
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video with a tribute to their deceased mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed medical records of more than 1100 Australians diagnosed in 2005 with ovarian cancer and found that only 35% lived five years after the diagnosis.
The research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute stated that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die than women in urban areas during the study.
STUDY: New medicines can slow lung cancer and ovaries
Women's researchers followed during seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in elderly women diagnosed with cancer at an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan claims that factors could be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
"The disease is best treated by gynecoonologists, who usually reside in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of remote medical services to overcome the distance barrier, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen the transport service that will enable specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who heal away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan stated that the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of the geographical location, which underlines the need for better treatment and prevention programmes.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today by the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, the young mother Elisha Neave from Gold Coast was diagnosed with aggressive ovarian cancer in her 33 years of age.
Garden centers regret reducing the number of homeowners
According to the HTA study published by the Financial Times, the fall associated with the extraordinary decline of owners of houses under 35 years of age could lead to a “main age group of gardeners” reaching the “main age group of gardeners” of up to 10 million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent housing spend on average 55% of the amount spent by people living in their gardens.
As other factors threatening the sector, which makes an estimated £5 billion a year, the increase in the number of people living in very urbanised areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of paving instead of the gardens used as a parking area and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Great London area, where the share of houses owned has fallen from 61% to 43% over six years, one household accounts for the lowest expenditure on garden products in Britain.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society stated that living in a sublet or a lack of space does not mean that humans cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, the main gardener for RHS, said: “The tenants have a very popular plant cultivation in pot plants - when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "gold age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
Also this year, he predicted higher sales due to better weather that came under adverse conditions in March and April.
When the Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at his youth organization meeting, which reminds me of Hitlerjugend most of all, saved me with atomic weapons and basically showed everyone that their views were stolen, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have a feeling that the current regime in Russia has many features of the fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and it is that they can be overcome by both intense nationalism and the fact that the complex of inferiority can transform them into imperialistic desires.
Time flows in the east probably differently than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of the war over Europe was long overdue, in the east they thought they had been overlooked for a long time and needed to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration ruled in Germany in the 1930 ’ s, just before the Nazi took over power and then followed the outbreak of nationalism unlike the present situation in Russia.
And then that completely identical cult of a strong leader, beating up journalists, eliminating uncomfortable political opponents, discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, that is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and most of the Russians probably miss the time Russia ruled half the world and the second part trembled before them.
Probably the Western politicians themselves, maybe little of them patting Vladimir on their shoulders, maybe they didn't invite him where he wanted to go, maybe they started underestimating him, and he just acted like a typical Russian man.
He made a mess at home, pretended he didn't even want to go anywhere, and he was grinding knives at home.
Now he's decided to take back the lost position.
He starts slow, he's free.
He's probably a leader for life, so where he'd be in a hurry.
He trampled the Caucasus, now he's gonna trample the Ukrainians, then the Dwarfs from the Baltics are next.
They've been pinching a Russian bear in a fur coat long enough.
China, too, is likely to notice this, which is getting a little too high and is definitely making a big deal about the far east.
And the Germans of Vladimir are pretty upset about how well they're doing, and I put that up their ass at 45.
How about we do one new Novorosija in Karlovy Vary?
That would be the base, and there's a lot of ours, and as they're being oppressed by the dača, they've already wanted to demolish some of them.
After all, our veterans are still remembering how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Well, their prime minister, Gospodin Sobotka, is so soft, it can be peeled off like onions and eats all their EU.
That'd be so much fun for the big Russians to jump out.
They should be reminded of their place.
And as detonators, we're gonna use our contemporaries who live in their territory.
There's a lot of Russians everywhere, and when they're said to be oppressed, they're just oppressed, and we're not gonna let that happen, we're gonna protect them.
And once again, the Russians will rule, for what else is it born for?
After all, Europe is only good as a pretext on which a proud Ivan can dance a Cossack.
Turkey has summoned an American diplomat for a spy report.
The Turkish Foreign Minister has called for the highest-ranking US diplomat in the country to explain the report on US and British espionage activity in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said that the American charge d'affaires and Turkish civil servants discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept stated that according to the documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority objective of American and British intelligence services.
According to the Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ignored the importance of the report and stated that all major states were watching each other.
The earlier report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, provoked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
Series Game of Thrones presented other tricks of the fourth row
The creators of Throne Games are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted of the fourth - row tricks.
The most visible are the computer modifications of the serial environment and the mass scene, when the depth of the soldiers becomes the giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Police Director Magaluf charged with corruption
The complainants submitted on Friday to the Office of the Mallor State Prosecutor evidence of extortion by the police and civil servants of the City Hall in Calvia.
A police director in Calvia on the island of Mallorca was arrested after the charges of the accused entrepreneurs and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after several businessmen from Punta Ballen were charged with corruption, a street where most of the bars and nightclubs in Magaluf are located.
According to Mallorca Diario, the complainants submitted evidence of extortion by the police and civil servants of the city hall of Calvia to the prosecutor of the Mallorian Anti-Corruption Office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish state police because of their connection to the corruption charge and, together with Navarro, the judge will hear them.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted the dissatisfactioned owners of nightclubs, according to which public authorities’ advantage has a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival," one of the entrepreneurs said in court.
Don't mess with our living.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made it to the world's main pages of magazines after a video of an 18-year-old British tourist appeared on YouTube, who provided oral sex to 24 men during the bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to oversee drunkards and rioters among the parties to the Magaful holiday parties by reducing the number of infamous alcoholic tour bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where oral sex events occurred, was forced to close for a year and together with the tour operators at Carnage bars to pay a fine of 55 000 euros ($73 000).
The Magaluf tourist resort, which is especially popular with the British, also witnessed many alcohol-related accidents, including the fashion wave known as "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day is marked by rain and storms affecting flights to Adelaide Airport
JARO brought an ice surprise to the south of South Australia, with strong rain and heavy winds that seriously hit the airport in Adelaide.
The next 5 mm of precipitation in the city is due to occur until nine o'clock in the evening, and the next 6.6 mm will start during the night on Sunday.
The last rain was introduced together with a few short rainstorms associated with the storm and the gust of the wind, which began eight o'clock in the evening and brought almost 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After a few early spring doses came last winter, the city’s temperatures dropped again on Monday at just 15.8 °C.
It is believed that the storm weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30, but at short distance it was affected by a change in the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to postpone the landing.
The winds at the airport in Adelaide reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground at that time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop from the second landing and eventually arrived at about 8:40.
The delay in the aircraft subsequently caused delays in the additional flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
According to the forecast, they reach a maximum of 16 °C in Adelaide on Tuesday, and one or two exaggerates may appear.
Children of Israel return to school after the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters, while in the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas attacked their homes by rockets and minettes. However, schools in Gaza remain closed while the territory recovers from fighting.
The beginning of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in the south of Israel marked by attacks, but the signs of struggle are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, employees of a kindergarten hit by a rocket, removed the remains from the wall, slowly expecting the return of children.
"We're a little worried, but we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bartová, a resident of kibbuc Saad and an English teacher at a local school.
A lot of children in this area really need to get back to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart revealed that "it's a little strange" to go to school again.
"We've been through a few tough times and we've never left the house," she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until last week's end of the war, thousands of inhabitants of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or homes and went to safer areas away from Gaza to escape missiles and miners.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border, in which a shot from the Palestinian Minomet killed a four-year-old boy with a return he hesitates.
The Minister of Education stated that about 12 families had still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in foster schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gazan border, which was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study diligently and added: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a timeless peace last Tuesday.
Although the ceasefire led to the immediate end of fighting, it did not solve key problems such as the demand of Hamas to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the re-opening of Gazan airports and ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers fallen in war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to start later this month in Egypt.
More than 2 100 Palestinians died in war, estimated by Palestinians and the United Nations, three quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these figures and estimates that at least half of the people killed were radicals, even though there is no clear evidence for these claims.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, died on the Israeli side.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired during the fighting on Israeli cities mainly in the south of the country 4 591 missiles and missiles from the Minomets.
The Israeli army again carried out more than 5,000 air raids and other attacks.
Israel’s attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250 000 people hid in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into temporary shelters.
Because of the tens of thousands of people still in hiding, the school officials postponed the beginning of the school year due to the ongoing fighting last week.
"I hope that the school will soon open up so that we can complete our education just like Jewish children and other children in the world," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in Gaza's largest city.
I'm standing behind you.
And Lafata's temperature is troubling
The Czech football team met before noon in Prague before the Wednesday preparatory match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-member cast, Spartan assailant David Lafata, who is suffering from heat, has problems.
David's not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, and it was more players, and David probably still has a little bit of trouble.
But we want him to be here and be okay as soon as possible," said the journalist, coach Pavel Vrba.
"If it is two or three days, or tomorrow it will be fit, we will see it according to his medical condition, which our doctor will decide on," he added.
The other players are fine.
"Of course, someone has some kind of pain, but it's not that they can't train or participate in the game on Wednesday with the US," said the Czech coach.
On Sunday night Vrba was the last player to be called by the Spartan backup player Lukáš Vácha.
He admitted that it was not easy to make decisions, but other mid - schoolers also took into account.
I decided that Luke was a prospective player who was 25 years old.
It was very difficult to make decisions, but I am behind it," Vrba said to Vách.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is not excluded that nomination could change in the case of health problems.
On the weekend, for example, the Liberecist Josef Šural, who gave the hat trick, flashed great performance.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown form.
Let's see where David Lafata is.
In case it is not available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot donate any of the players who have been interested in the Czech league," said Vrba.
This afternoon the training team is waiting on Strahov, on Tuesday then the classic pre-fighting training before the duel with the USA at Letná, which will be open to fans and after which the autographing will follow.
The game with Americans is played on Wednesday at 8:15 p.m., and the national team will be working for the premiere victory under Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory games, he played two draw and once lost.
The qualification match with the Netherlands is then on September 9th at 20:45.
Pesice goes to Italy in the Netherlands
Vrba is happy to have more time to train, unlike previous meetings.
It's an advantage when you have a player for eight days and you can practice with them certain things that maybe we didn't have that much time before.
Now we will be able to focus only on getting the best of us ready for the Netherlands," Vrba praised us.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy before the game in Prague on Thursday, and the duel will personally follow the former temporary coach Josef Pešice.
He'll give us the information that comes from the game.
But it's not just about him, we're going to have the game and we're going to have it filmed and we're going to take it down.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes will be there," Vrba said to the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to very monitored statistics, the prices of flats in the winter period have increased the most over the last seven years.
According to the housing value index in the Australian capital of RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices increased by 1.1 % in August, the agency reported on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than twice per year until August 2013, but the profit was not spread evenly in the country.
RP Research Director Data Tim Lawless stated that Sydney and Melbourne are in charge of the market.
The RP Data numbers show that the prices of flats in Sydney last year increased by 16.1%, while prices in Melbourne by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with an average price increase of between five and six percent.
On the other hand, the scale was placed by Canberra, which was damaged by the state ordered to reduce expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that when spring started now, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
"In view of the persistent high level of auction sales, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that housing will increase over the next three months," he said.
My father never hugged me.
He never called me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a colder relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked at the factory.
Henry is trying comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry went through "extensive" therapy, and now he's thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, just heard his voice: “Stop with the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - when I was a child, they were adults - they went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass with beer or the beauty of hitting a cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
Most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading newspapers.
Recently Henry visited Dudley foundry, and although conditions were better than in his father’s day, he looked into what life had to be like for him.
There's a little bit more light out there today, but it's still dark, smoky, cloudy labyrinth, where flames explode, and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad was always in the tub, and he was just lying there, and then he heard him sing for himself slowly because he was washing up the foundry.
When I walked by, I realized he'd been doing this for years to feed on his family, and I started to appreciate him more.
Even so, Henry had a childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say "I love you."
When Mom was sick and dying, we started thinking, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
His daughter Billie, whom she has with Dawn French, has enabled him to experience the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you" thing?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom.
With a French woman he was married to for 25 years, they're still good friends.
Dawn's a good girl.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes started to show, the doctor said, "You have to make a radical change."
So I started going to the big fitness center, and I also had to keep a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
No one wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After he received the credit from the critic for his Othello, he immersed himself in the theater.
Followed by a comedy full of mistakes and August Wilson's fences.
It's a different experience from sitcoms and comedy that filled his hectic work life.
He started when he was 16 and worked at the factory.
DJ noticed him parodying someone on the stage and wrote about him at the New Faces talent show.
His television career began in the mid-70s: "For a long time, I was the only black imitator/comitor on TV."
He was learning for the march.
In addition to the fact that I had to be noticed by the public, I had to learn between 1975 and 1985 how to make up working jokes, be a star and perform on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, a entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed with his comedy for five years.
My family was sick because of that.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Even though it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was the "years and years of the award-winning main product of British television" was also "the grotesque parody of blacks."
In the 1980s Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters that also mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began to broadcast in 1984 and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as Chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
It took him decades to get commercials, papers, TV shows, and roles in the movies, but after sending his show LennyHenry.tv to BBC in 2008, he said: "What are you gonna do now, Len, it's a little bit like you got stuck in one place, or you're a little out of the way."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first one was Shakespeare.
I had a serious allergy to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it at school, and I thought it was something for a white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it."
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented 20 lines of Othell's final speech for the document, and he was already there.
It made me feel like I could do it.
It's like it gave me courage.
“That’s what it is. It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the lyrics, find out about it.
So the trial was hard, and I've read the game months and months before.
And it was a success.
It looked like they were in trouble, which didn't happen.
Soon he started playing in Comedy full of mistakes.
All of a sudden, I was at the National Theatre.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical defect, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for the seizure of the audience.
"The sound in my head said to me, 'Before he repairs the computer, you must now entertain them for ten minutes."
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance will continue as soon as the problem has been resolved.
I left the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve this for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry at the Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lyrics of the fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, he adds determination.
The game was also well accepted, so it's like a divine sign that says, "This is what you should do."
Of course, he says it in a VOICE voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I'm glad to be in the rehearsal room.
Henry still remains the brain of a comedian - our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances when he enters and emerges from the role of an imitator.
I've decided not to make stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a little dangerous, I'd say.
If you're always looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not happy about it like I used to.
I asked him if he'd ever organize a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in one room with a director who helps to give the outline of the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You're always telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shine on non-existent employees
Kenya began a biometric registration of all its civil servants to try to remove non-existent employees from the payroll.
According to the government's statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will cease to be paid.
The government believes that thousands of people are paid even after they have left state service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to avoid corruption in the state administration.
The audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars per month ($700 000) on the salaries of non-existent workers and on the continued abuse of official power.
The government suspects that salaries are still being placed on bank accounts even after the death of the employee or after the employee has left the administration, reported a BBC reporter from Nairobi capital, Wanyama Cheburi.
All civil servants must arrive at identification centres within the next two weeks, where their data are biometrically recorded, in the government statement.
He goes on to say that anyone who fails to show up without an apology will be expelled from the payroll.
"By determining real public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its management and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of the government and thus solve the problem of non-existent workers," said Anne Waiguru, the secret of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
Local media reports that 33 police officers were detained in Turkey due to suspicion of a "spying against the government".
The police office hasn't commented on the case yet.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, there were 14 high-ranking officials in custody.
Some of them were involved in the December corruption investigation, which focused on government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for the alleged organization of criminal gangs and telephone wiretaps.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at that time Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the action of Islamic spiritual Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine have returned to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1st September) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister of Arseni Jaceňuk has taken his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told present journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for the next generation:
Not at all schools there was a traditional ceremony on September 1st.
There's peace in Ukraine, not all of it.
We must fight for peace.
The whole Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavjansk, attended by Jaceňuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, maybe the BBC found a hard-time boss.
It brings with it a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal conclaves of the conservative party.
She has experience in the front lines herself.
She began her career in the consulting company Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was the Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Times for seven years, and she resigned when Pearson's parent company had taken over her younger colleague.
It's said that her retirement was close to a million pounds.
Her political portfolio is also extensive.
David Cameron was recommended by Lord Browne, former CEO of BP, when Cameron needed private expertise in Whitehall: she became an advisor to the government.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's job as a poison cup.
Not only is the BBC a large and complex entity in the center of public life, but there is also an inner paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns two directions: inside on the top layer of the BBC's own leadership hierarchy, but also out to the public in times of unrest when things don't work.
It is an almost unsustainable monopoly that calls for a thorough reform.
Which director, however, would risk coming to a firm complex as a Chinese dynasty, decomposing it and thereby losing their jobs.
It's a tough challenge.
If it wasn't so hard, a lot of people would like to see the BBC shrink - her power, her finances - and how her status is revised.
With the expansion of competition and new technology questioning old certainty, immediate negotiations on concession fees for the BBC are taking on a great deal of danger.
For a modest amount of 145.50 pounds a year, the British public buys a share of what is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that 96% of households produce it, each cost only 40 pence a day.
Moreover, the BBC’s popularity is clearly rising: 53% of its supporters compared to 31% of those of ten years ago.
The use of BBC services has changed: Today, I see news headlines on my mobile phone and I can see iPlay on the programs I missed.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and wonderful institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry claims he didn't approve the offensive tweet
Tweet from the official twitter account of Governor Ricky Perry, who was published on Sunday, contained an insulting picture of the democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry's criminal accusations of abuse of power.
Tweet was later deleted and another one was published in Perry's account, which was distanced from the previous one.
A tweet came from my account that wasn't authorized.
"I disagree with the tweet and I downloaded it," he said in the next post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although tweets were sent from Perry's official account, it is not clear who is actually responsible for his administration.
The previous tweet published an unflattering, humorous picture of the state's attorney Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was sentenced to drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay money for her office, which brought Perry, a possible candidate for president in the 2016 election, to the grand jury in Austin this month.
It said in the tweet: "I don't always drive three times as much alcohol as the limit is allowed... but when I do, I'm suing Governor Perry for calling me responsible."
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
Michael McCrum, the special prosecutor from San Antonio, was in charge of him, who was designated a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent, and he called the charges a tactical political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has requested a judge overseeing the case to reject the charges because the use of the law to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas's history is unconstitutional.
Perry interrupted the payment of $7.5 million from the State Fund for the Division of Public Interest, which is based in Travis County and is suing for corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection raised a formal complaint by a left-handed group of civil activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes it gets famous.
After his 2012 presidential campaign in Iowa ended in fifth place on the committee of his party, Perry responded to the speculation that he might be finishing up with a tweet of his own picture running near the lake and saying, "Here I am, South Carolina!"
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to normal.
One of the most prominent London development companies warned that the housing market in south-eastern England “returned” to normal levels of activity.
Residents in the capital were subject to high demand and rising prices and increased concerns about the credit bubble caused the Bank of England to impose mortgage limits in June.
On Monday, Tony Pidgley, the founder and chairman of a demanding client development company for Berkeley, said: “Since the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned from a peak in 2013 to a normal level of transactions.” He adds that it provides a “stable environment for functioning.”
The London housing market was successful during the decline because buyers from abroad flooded into the capital city.
According to the Cadastral Office's data, prices in the city rose by 18.5% in the last year alone, thus far avoiding an average of 6.7% in England and the whole of Wales.
The average selling prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and reached £423,000 at the end of April.
However, thanks to the strengthening pound, London's real estate buyers have not been so attractive in recent months - some of them have also threatened to introduce new property taxes and talk about possible "settlement tax" with which politicians came before the parliamentary elections next May.
Last week, London’s real estate firm Foxtons warned that the April mortgage market review, which introduced stricter lending rules, will slow down the growth rate of both real estate and price sales during the second half of the year.
The Bank of England’s new data on Monday showed a decline in the amount of approved mortgages per month July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
The Hamptons International, another real estate office, has reduced its house prices to 3% on the basis of the fact that they have already begun to fall.
According to WA Ellis, the volume of transactions was reduced by a quarter each year in London's most expensive neighborhoods, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington.
Yet, the demand for housing in the capital city of Berkeley was a blessing because it increased cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The request for the right, good-looking housing in a good location remained the same and therefore the forward sales were maintained. ”
In June, the company announced that it sold 3,742 properties from the beginning of the year to the end of April, almost a third more than before the crisis in 2007.
The annual pre-tax profit increased by 40% to GBP 380 million, yields by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday, before the annual meeting of Pidgley, he said that it was anticipated that Berkeley’s annual revenues would be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be £450 million.
Berkeley shares stopped at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange this afternoon.
Hacker posted pictures of naked Jennifer Lawrence on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is coming to the 85th Academy Awards.
The photos of Oscar's owner, Jennifer Lawrence, escaped on the Internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a "list" of photos of another hundreds of starting actresses.
The spokesman of the movie star "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real and criticized the hacker for "obvious breach of privacy."
The authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who will publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
Hacker's photos, originally published on the 4chan Image Sharing Server, were allegedly acquired thanks to a gap in the Internet storage system of Apple iCloud. The alleged list of photos of hacked victims according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
"I hope that those of you who are looking at pictures that my husband and I took in private home years ago are happy with each other," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice, known from the TV series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the pictures would be real. On Twitter she said: "These are my supposed naked photos are the SubVRH, people."
It's better to cut it loose.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday night that the spokesman of pop stars Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photographs would be true.
An extraordinary demonstration from Howard Jacobson's praised new novel on love and the letter "J"
They're dissolved, that's the best way to describe it, gradually decomposing themselves like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Just from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, too complicated, too violent, too isolated, and maybe a little bit annoying.
And then she shook his hand.
He's been impulsively admitting it.
He could fuck like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was a love affair that more than usual promised to relieve him of his lonely boredom and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild hair and a overflowing heart from a village on the north island, which was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
To the south came with an older companion, whom Kevern believed to be her aunt, who inherited property in a wet but beautiful valley called the Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes leaked, the dead spiders were in the baths, the slugs snooze on the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds reminded of the huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage of children's stories, scary and charming at the same time, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the provisional list of nominations at the Man Booker Prize 2014.
Shorter selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat in a long grass chair and held hands, enjoying an unexpected warm spring afternoon, not at all tuned up by a public station, which provided comforting music and comforting news to him when he looked at her tanned cross-legged legs and reminded him of the old song of a long-forgotten black comedian, whom his father liked to listen to when the roller blinds were drawn.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggression, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They were not prohibited - there was nothing really forbidden - they just didn't play.
They helped them get to the desuetuda, just like the word desuetudo.
People's taste has proved what regulations and positions would never be able to do outside the law, and like people who choose books, they choose the memoirs in which the poor man becomes rich, cooks and love novels, so music chooses the ballads.
Kavern got torn down by the day and started playing imaginary piano and with a rough, comic voice he sang Serenade to Ailleni's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a favorite song by jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
That's what his father always did when he tried to suppress the letter j before he got out of his mouth.
It started out as a game when he was little.
My father told him he played the game with his father.
When you were talking about what started on j, you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny at the time, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that's all.
He must have explained what jazz was.
Ailinn's never heard of one.
Even jazz, even if it wasn't built directly outside the law, they didn't play.
Improvisation's out of fashion.
There's only room in life for one "if."
When she started playing melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she'd end up.
Same with humor.
His unforeseeableness has made people nervous.
And jazz was a humor expressed in song.
Although he hasn't heard from Sammy Davis Junior in up to ten years, Kevern knew jazz from his father's half-secret CD collection.
At least Aillin didn't have to say Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn't remember a time when her favorite singers weren't black.
No laws or pressure.
A free society is one in which each part of it, with gratitude - with gratitude to those who have been spared by chance - agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution were suitable for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People originating from the Indian subcontinent, as if by nature donated to electronics, assumed responsibility that no family would be without a functional phone.
The Poles that stayed were plumbers, the Greeks who stayed were washing dishes.
Those of the states of the Gulf and Levant whose grandparents did not leave the country quickly, while doing what happened when it happened - they were afraid that they would be accused of putting them in the fire, in fact they were afraid that the fire would next spend them - they opened a restaurant where they sold weakness and smoked water pipes, did not alert themselves and did not eat them slowly.
Everyone according to his talents.
Since she only listened to the ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how music could come from the dirty words that Kavern had just sung to her.
Music was an expression of love.
"In fact, they are not dirty," Kevern said.
Maybe only for people with too many legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he liked this song.
He spoke too, but the neglected garden provided an illusion of security.
Not a word could escape from behind soundproofing leaves.
Ailinn still didn't get it.
Why would your father like that?
He was going to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth again in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny to him," he said eventually.
She shook her head unbelievingly and overshadowed Keverne's view.
In the whole wide world, nothing could be seen but the confusion of her raven hair.
That's all he wanted to see.
"If you think," she said doubtfully.
That still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Is my legs too big?
He looked again.
Not exactly.
Maybe a little ankle...
Are you saying you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
I hate it?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have called her "I love you," but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles right now," he tried.
I'm kind of creepy.
That didn't work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in trouble because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty that was lurking in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe he was deliberately cruel, Kavern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons reddished and got off the couch, knocked off the radio, and spilled under-drinked wine.
No-wine wine, so it wasn't the drinking.
She looked like she was shaking like palm leaves in a storm in her excitement.
"I'm sickly attracted to you being an idiot," she said...
Except I'm not attracted to it.
He felt sorry for her, both for her unkind words and for the fear she had in her eyes the moment she faced him.
She thought she was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he never doubted that in the basics it was the same as here.
The same wide and icy oceans were shaking over them.
The same deranged men, after STALO, even more irresistible and turbulent than their ancestors, smugglers, and incestuously roamed from pub to pub, prepared to lay hands on any woman who dared to refuse them or to laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, she'll be shown her fists!
First anoint her - anointing became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antibody of the faint balads about love, which the radio hurled - first anointed her, then murder her.
In Kevern's view, too much culture, because the petting itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons unverbally suggested he leave.
He got off the deck like an old man.
She felt angry herself, but her weight surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She was watching him leave - as if she were watching him from the window on the floor - the man he caught up with himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart got stuck because of him and all the men in general, no matter how few beat her up.
A man turned away from her, his shoulders hung, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she feel that she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember a single moment until today that she had seen it before?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
About 20 years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working in Ofnow, a non-statutary public mood monitoring system, prepared a short article on the continuation of light and moderate violent acts in the areas of the country where it was mitigated or stopped directly, expected that enough money and energy would be spent to remove it.
"A lot has been done, and a lot has yet to be done," she wrote, "to calm down the innate aggression of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of church towers rising over the hedges of living human kindness, it rarely appeared historically."
But some things are irreplaceable.
The higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
Residents groan over sentimental ballads, devour unfortunate stories, and claim to believe firmly in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that old brutality is as stubborn as in urban agglomerations, but also shows that new and offensive intolerance appears at home, in the workplace, in the roads and even in the sports fields.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too mottling," said her superior.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you gay?
Esme's been reinstated by her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"I am not asking," Rabinowitz finally said, "that I should have something against atheists, lesbians or feminists.
We don't have prejudices in this workplace.
We serve unconnected companies.
But a certain type of hypersensitivity, which in itself is completely acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Clearly, you yourself are prejudiced to the Church - things you call "crude" and "brutal" might also interpret as an expression of natural power and energy.
Still to deal with what happened if it happened, as if it had happened, yesterday, preparing the country with its basic life force.
While Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the lightboard, there was a pink flash of recommendations that Ofnow sent to the world for the last quarter of the century or more.
Smile for your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to the ballads, go to the musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
It's better to speak than silence, the singing word is better than written, but there's nothing better than love.
“I completely understand your reservations,” said Esme Nussbaum, when she was sure that her supervisor had finished, “and I am no longer saying that the wound has not healed as we say it has healed.
My concern, first of all, is that if we are not aware of this in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what would have happened if this had happened.
This time, however, we will not be ventilating our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the fingertips.
That was meant to mean infinite patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps you may have taken and may not have taken your grandparents as mistakes.
You also go too far to talk about venting your "fright" and "untrust" on the "other."
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present, we are not talking about "us" and "they."
There was no "we" and there were no "they."
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
“During which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took the courage, “we are no one faultless.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, it happened.
That was before.
There's nothing to say - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt that can be seduced, there are no things that should be rectified, even if correction was appropriate and possible.
But what is the past for, other than learning from it -
There's a past for us to forget.
If there's anything I can add to that--
Luther Rabinowitz disconnected the fingertips.
"I will take your report into account," he said and released it.
The day when she went to work as usual, she was hit by a biker who hit the sidewalk in a way that the passers described as “brutal and furious.”
Coincidence happens.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesoth claims that there is no coup planned - the Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Military officers of the Kingdom of Lesoth denied that they would organize a coup to overthrow the government and claim to have acted against the police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says that the army surrounded his official seat and occupied government buildings in the capital of Masser.
After he declared that they were threatening to kill him, the Prime Minister and his family went to the neighbouring Republic of South Africa.
Major Ntle Ntoi, spokesperson of the army, said that it was not really a coup, but an army response to the threat of "political fanatics" which the police tried to arm.
"This morning, the command of the defense forces of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there are several groups in the ranks of the police planning to arm up some radical political fanatics who were about to make a trigger in the country," he said to the Voice of America.
The spokesperson of South Africa's government, Clayson Monyela, said that military actions looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
“Although no one has declared that he has taken government power by force, the actions of the lesoth defense forces seem to bear the sign of a coup,” he said.
Military representatives of the Kingdom of Lesotho said that the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was quiet.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane stated that in his opinion, the target of the attack is to fight corruption in the country because of his efforts.
Since Thabane suspended the session of Parliament due to internal disputes, tension has prevailed in Lesotho.
He declared that despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his actions to the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month minimum
Production growth slowed to a 13-month minimum according to a carefully monitored survey in August in the euro area.
The final index of shopping managers in the euro area (PMI) from June 51.8 fell to 50.7.
A number higher than 50 means expansion.
New orders have been lost and factories have damaged the rising tension between the EU and Russia because of Ukraine.
The numbers come from the European Central Bank (ECB) Thursday's meeting.
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank to deal with the remote recovery of the euro area as well as the risk of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering the quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the US have approached during the financial crisis.
“Although some growth is better than no growth, a braking effect that has a growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty about the manufacturer is becoming more visible,” said Rob Dobson, the main economist of Markit.
The production PMI Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to a minimum of 51.4 months.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, PMI fell on 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has gone from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands have also disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to pour oil into the fire to analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI increased to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the production overview of sales managers for August is that it shows that the sector is growing."
He added: Producers in the euro area currently have a very difficult life because the increasing geopolitical tension - especially between Russia and Ukraine - adds even more uncertainty to the increasingly demanding conditions in many countries.
This increasing uncertainty of trade has demonstrably affected - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially the expensive ones.
He stated that, as “more likely,” the ECB would eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of hell survivors from Beslan: Ten years since the horrors of the occupied school, children are still suffering
Ten years ago, a thousand people were arrested by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, South Russia
More than 330 people were killed during the suffering that lasted three days and shocked the world, more than half of which were children
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocities.
Exactly ten years after the terrible occupation of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, last night, the surviving heroes warned about the new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When, on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorist children and parents captured and murdered, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
The opposition to tragedy united the East and the West, which in this catastrophic disaster led to negotiations and the future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, South Russia, to search for some of the victims who escaped death during school atrocities.
We have found amazing young people who have resisted unhappiness, even though the memory of hell caused by terrorists will continue to live in them.
What's their biggest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - should be over.
A girl trying to get back into a destroyed school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dimitri Beliakov, just trying to get back into the bombed-out school gym after the bomb exploded in her underwear.
A confused Aida desperately sought her mother Larissa, who is now forty.
There were concerns that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"Some woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
I got my feet from blood.
I got up and came back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to do another surgery.
I have pieces of shrapnel left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people the way her doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly did not destroy it," she said determinedly.
“It just happened to me, and that can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we're trying not to talk about it with our friends.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and my future classmate, Dzer Gapeva, were killed there.
As a kid, we used to play together and imagine how we'd go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I graduate from school and start my career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she didn't forget the captivity, but every year she's got a little pale.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we received from Britain and other countries.
Looking at my picture of me climbing through the school window on the Internet, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster, and prevent it from repeating itself.
A boy who escaped from the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia, the children of the school began at seven years) and survived the three-day siege of the school in the embrace of their mother Tamara.
At that time, a seven - year - old said: “My mother told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand. ”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, he was running, and he saw the crying toddlers, grabbed the baby by the hand, and ran off with a shower of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said: “Damir told me his mother was dead. ”
She says, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara stumbled into freedom and was lying in a hospital with a wounded leg, and on the contrary she thought her son had died.
After meeting again, she said: “I wept with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He came in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the news of the World), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that memories are getting pale.
I remember, right after I threw all my guns away to play.
But today, I can play computer games that are being shot, and I don't have a problem with that.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I used to play with in the yard that didn't get out.
We'll never say they were killed or died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember a trip to London well, especially on how I could choose anything I wanted in a toy shop and how I drove a convertible.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine where he suffers from war just as he and his friends have suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
"I am terribly sorry for everyone who has to go through such a horror," says Damir, who took part in volunteer activities in the monastery last week.
I want to be very helpful.
One day, I want to work with the police, and I hope they'll see me at the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, and there were no children out there screaming and running, and that silence took months.
He lives to remember the journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people cried.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings and how they could express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally say that even if it was ten years ago, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir's appetite for borschch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water gun, and they were running and playing with him.
And it's only been a month since the horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I still think the world has not changed for the better in the last ten years.
Now there's a war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children will be killed and killed.
They're the same kids as ours.
I think, for a lot of people, war is just something on the news that they listen to when they get bored or while they're doing something else.
I know what those people are going through, what a terrible thing that is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir's grown up and he's a nice and quiet kid, not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care at all.
I know she doesn't like to remember it, but she's very close to six classmates, and she goes to the gym from time to time, and they light candles.
When he was smaller, he had a problem with it - I remember when he was lying on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes he was lying there for hours.
He didn't sleep, he had his eyes open.
I also remember he threw out all his guns or other guns to play.
I can barely believe I was sure he was dead for a few hours and I'd never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell, and there were pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember screaming, ‘Damire, run, run!’, but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and he ran away.
So our lives go further than others.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
A boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of terror in Beslan
Comfort: Survivors from Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with their mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, to the right of Grigorij today
When he was running for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was frowned upon his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of the Beslan atrocity.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off at school on his first day, and hurried to take her older son Vladimir to college.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists entered the yard, so my little boy stayed there alone for three days," she said.
Not entirely alone because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigorij survived.
As the date approaches, it's still harder to think about it and talk.
There won't be a single day before we remember the tragedy.
It doesn't seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Photo Grigorija (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was forever as a statue (right)
I remember Grigorij was so excited about school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
That he was alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of a crying Grigori in San Marino.
Grigorij doesn't like to see the picture, and we have it in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that because of this picture, people around the world know how much pain we feel.
Today, Grigorij says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
Similar tragedies are still under investigation, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the boeing crash in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what the cause was?
This world is expecting something very bad.
"I don't understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, no one wants a war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget a little, it takes decades.
It had an effect on my health, I can still feel it.
I had a nightmare attack for three or four years, but then it got better.
When I got back to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I go to the gym when it's coming September 1st.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year, I graduated from school and began to study medicine at the University of Vladikavaz.
I want to be a heart surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but for health reasons, I couldn't.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
God’s Kingdom, 20 / 15
A boy who survived, even though he was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist
A miracle: Gregorij Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full force, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a miracle he survived.
"We feel like it was yesterday," said Gregorij, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent, but because of the injuries he suffered during the attack, he could not.
It's still with me, it's not something I put behind me.
I'm older now, and they say that kids can deal with bad experiences better - I must say, that's not true.
“In 2006, I went to a psychologist, and it made me feel a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'm never going back there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I sit on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photograph taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as physical health is concerned, I'm fine.
I have to be careful of my knee, which I hurt myself, but I'm already walking normally.
But still, for health reasons, I couldn't get in and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my papers, including medical reports, and they told me that it was impossible.
My next favorite is animals, so I got into the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from cats to cows.
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about this.
It's not something that kids should know about, and not at all something that they should be experiencing.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain will always be here.
She's inside and getting worse with her anniversary coming up.
I'm going to take part in the memorial ceremony.
I know Grigorij isn't coming.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there, unlike me.
I waited for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God he gave it back to me.
It stays with us.
Gregorij is an adult today, but he's carrying on with the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it for his knee.
He's done several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't practice.
I'd say he's over 50 percent of the horror, but he can't get over it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, they killed a lot of our friends and neighbors, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I liked and were close to.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could have given me, but I'm in pain of losing the killed.
I know families where other children were born, but also widows who were never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's going on in the world - wars in other places.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
War is approaching our country now, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to the fact that we're fighting now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If only we could take all the rebels and throw them away as far away as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
A child who took a special commando to safety
Saved: Alyonu Tskaevu carries to a secure Russian special commando (left).
Now she's ten (right) and she doesn't remember tragedy at all.
In 2004, the world hit the ground when a small Alyon brought a Russian policeman out of his arms from Beslan captivity.
The terrorists released her, but in captivity at the school gym, they kept her 30 - year - old mother, Kristina’s ten - year - old sister, and Makhar’s brother.
Makhar, who was three years old, escaped, but Alyon’s mother and sister died during the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried, and she and her new wife Svetlana have a little girl named Kristina after her dead daughter.
The neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, does not remember the attack and has grown bright and happy.
A close friend said that “they are a great happy family, and Alyona and Makhar are great children. ”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories of the tenth anniversary.
You can understand why.

4 tips on how to get better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in shooting or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment.
Cheapest options are compact such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with a couple of cameras, all cost less than $350.
It does not matter what equipment you use, but several rules apply to achieve the best results.
Check your gear.
Even if you have a watertight camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are firmly closed.
Then set the camera depending on the type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes the exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you do that, find out how deep you can immerse yourself in your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only to 5 feet, the next up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide by buying and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and watertight design.
Always take a few shots - a lot of them won't work.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you with the photo composition, but outdoors don't have it.
Even if you have LCD, it will be badly visible underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more shots.
If the camera has a cracketing mode that makes a series of shots with a slightly different dispersion of the exposure, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
With a deeper dive of light, it is deteriorating significantly.
If possible, stay close to the sea when shooting in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you sink, the less colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That's great advice if you're taking pictures on land, but underwater is even more important because of a damper light.
It is especially important if you are filming with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill in the photo frames, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality could change things even in a huge organization like the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieve patients from the pain caused by disease and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of torture that maimed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors are focusing on diagnosis and disease, treated patients in the vast majority are interested in something completely different: pain.
One day, however, in 2007, it was him who began to suffer.
"I don't feel like myself," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt powerless.
He faced the symptoms of the flu and found that he was impatient, and Juliet included regrets.
He noted: "I want everything to happen sooner rather than later."
When Juliet left for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and unexplained.
Something wasn't right.
A colleague made him a chest X-ray.
One week before, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray came back.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the mesothelioma or the pulmonary lining.
In most cancers, it's hard to determine what caused it.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoke.
Mesoteliom is different.
Almost in all cases, it is the cause of the exposure to asbestos - to a fibrous building material that has previously been called "miracle," but is now known to be deadlyly dangerous.
For most of us, it wasn't hard to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belong to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry entered into force.
Even at a time when asbestos was being used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulating treasurers, builders, carpenters, and workers in shipyards.
The toxin used in industry in another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But that kind of selfishness isn't in place.
As it turns out, in Britain today, mesothelioma epidemics are peaking.
The number of mesothelioma deaths is higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year are twice the number of car accident victims.
Number of Mesothelioma deaths per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we only feel its effects now, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades to develop mesothelioma.
A disaster in the form of mesothelioma does not affect only the veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestus was, and in many cases still is, present in the homes where we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
Mesoteliom therefore does not respect the social layer, wealth, profession, or age.
Privileges from London shopping houses to public schools do not represent shelter.
Parliament, too, is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which they should treat us are the repository of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even isolate.
He was trying to find out where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It is possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement corridors of Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years in practice,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, sisters, doctors and doorkeepers - used corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, it was a question he was able to answer in part.
"Of the four doctors who had practiced at Guy's Hospital and who had mesothelioma in the past five years," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one still alive."
How many of us are going to get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis is not customary for so long.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us are going to get sick with the same disease? ”
According to a leading British mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Pet, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
When viewed in the files from the archives of courts, which are often referred to and required compensation, it shows how much the mesotheliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June admitted to Marks & Spencer that she had exposed the asbestos to Janice Allen out of negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised the clothing section in two stores - one of the places was the flagship company, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today, he has two children, who are over 20.
"Before this happened," he says, "I've never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
It never occurred to me that he might be involved in something.
There aren't many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given to him by his fibrillating structure, which gives him strength and flexibility.
Three of the six minerals were used in the construction industry.
Most often, in buildings today, it is possible to find chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even brake linings.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO still consider it a "great health risk" that can cause death.
But more dangerous is brown asbestos (amosit) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain once was the world's largest importer of brown asbestos and experts claim that "there is convincing but indirect evidence that this was the main cause of an unusually high mesothelioma."
Marsk & Spencer’s employees were exposed to asbestos at a flagship shop in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not be considered a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pete's work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients says that “a significant proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A large part of this exhibition is due to the "normal use and ventilation" of buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not know that they are being exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report saying that the service elevators and pipes behind the rooms of the parliamentary committee are contaminated by asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be damaged by something as harmless as "a powerful air stream."
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite can be true.
Although the Parliament's Services Directorate insisted that the Westminster Palace should receive a "principal medical certificate", it is now expected that one million pounds and several years of work will be needed to keep a close look at Parliament, modernise electricity and remove asbestos, and that, after the 2015 elections, the Members will sit in the areas of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Centre rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in accordance with several regulations.”
It is not possible to say whether this inconsistencies will cost lives.
Now everyone can only wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they have exposure to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) suspected that asbestos had been exposed to hospital work.
“I worked at a hospital where asbestos was demonstrated,” he says, “but in my case, I can’t prove it.
It's hard to remember all the places he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was overrun by something like a cold.
He was 45, he was at night, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly, I was shaking.
It came at the same time.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wasn't driving home.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the pneumothorax, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was mesothelioma.
He finally spent a month at home.
Confused doctors gave him a chest X-ray and introduced a chest catheter to remove the fluid they sent for analysis from his lungs.
Still, they didn't determine the diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and returned to work.
But from time to time, his symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients with similar symptoms came into surgery and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, however, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and got in direct contact with asbestos at work.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with the panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel bad, he had introduced a camera-equipped probe into the space between the sternum of the chest cavity and the pulmonary lining.
I'm an optimist.
I have a tendency not to take much," she says.
To be honest, I wasn't really worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came between Christmas and New Year's: "They told me it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began to meet with the sisters of the Macmillan charity organization, and one of them advised him to contact his lawyer.
That's when he realized the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in the pipeline," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now becoming sick.
Mesoteliom is now beginning to concern younger people who do not have a risk profession.
The most dangerous tubes thermally insulated by asbestos in hospitals were found in the basement, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, the staff members who passed through the basement corridors between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (such as Graham Abbott often) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it turns out now, several decades after the war, the hospital was a place where patients could save lives, but also a place that could have threatened the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is removed to this day.
The students built Bunsen Kahan on asbestos mats
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and inflammable properties.
Schools, too.
In fact, many asbestos people have already been exposed at school.
Somewhere in countless hours of chemistry, students were building Bunsen's kahan on asbestos pads.
A website dealing with asbestos in schools has been created.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes used to contain asbestos.
"It is an industrial poison built into a large number of houses," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos, which the woman suffering from mesothelioma was able to remember in the 1970s when the garden house was demolished.
So be careful, you're breaking down the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
"It takes a while for you to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I figured I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I've been in the O.R. for two weeks.
Then I realized I'd have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't live to see another Christmas.
One of the hardest things was to switch from doctor to patient position.
As an countless number of patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
"It was hard to understand all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have left?"
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking: “Well, I won’t live to see another Christmas.
That's how it is."
Mesoteliom is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive - breathing itself - is what causes cancer that kills.
Most mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos form small fibers.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers inhale, they can settle down in the iris, the extremity of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritating the hermit and can cause cell mutation.
"The problem is the inhaled asbestos fibers in the shape of needles," explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiosurgeon who joined Guy's Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos, which is paradoxically the head of the mesothelioma treatment center.
Treasure Lawson knew and treated other patients who were likely exposed during hospital practice.
The asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, says Treasure, and “the breathing itself is pushing on the edge where the lining is located.
It has been invasive since the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, the usual treatment options used for other types of cancer do not work much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is being debated hotly.
Some say it would be worth a shot.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the hermit," he says.
You can't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “not responding to chemotherapy very much,” which, although “has some effect, ” does not heal.
"Sometimes someone who survives lung cancer," says Treasure.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After discovering the mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and advisor to the equally disabled.
When they called, he joyfully introduced himself: “Hello, you have reached the cancer center. ”
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
His disease was diagnosed four years ago, and he was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and probably only last a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson “can show things in a more optimistic light. ”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski from the chest surgery department at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they searched me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a request, and they would have to approve his payment.
The question of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma to get the best treatment available.
But when various treatments eventually inevitably fail, many patients face another financial concern - the future of the family they leave behind.
That's why he's turning to the courts and asking for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Since 1898 it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health," says Morgan.
However, in the 1960 ’ s, it was found that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And this is where we meet the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally settled, but according to Morgan it was not a "full settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
However, after the investigation of the case, spokesperson Guy's Hospital confirmed that "the asbestos in the incriminated basement was removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove asbestos
To seduce the exposure of deadly asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proved to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
A lot of former workplaces changed the owner or went bankrupt.
The insurance records are missing.
And those who are now defending themselves have time on their part, which is certainly not their prosecutors.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was approved this year, thanks to which it is easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation even if it is not possible to track their former employer.
The law created a 350 million-dollar financial reserve paid by insurance companies to people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In such a case, they will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally assign to them as compensation - around £120,000.
300 successful applications are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks 350 million pounds is "good work".
"It is an agreement written by insurance companies," he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if they had not affected time and people with mesothelioma would be able to reach and normally sue their former employers.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths every year, it was necessary to act quickly.
"People suffer too much and need help now," said Penning in December last year during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended a Lang-Lazdunski operation, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he thought had a positive effect.
After surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were followed - triple therapy, for which Lang-Lazdunski may boast a survival rate of five years to 40% of patients.
Abbott made it stronger.
"Of course, that is not the most important thing," Abbott says.
In patients, you see it all the time.
There's something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott had an operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Inspections showed no signs of disease.
I went to the next inspection in March [2014].
In my chest, I had several spots [rapes] scattered.
My 50th birthday was just coming up.
It's not life-threatening.
He's on it.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
There are currently no traces of tumor in his body.
But it is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things-- financial security when I die, or if I show a woman how an alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you learn the bad news, you start to get negative.
You need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father (16) and Tamsin (14), it's not always easy.
"It's hard for parents," she says.
It's hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I'd never be old.
Their reactions were different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She told her friends, and all of a sudden, we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reticent.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients must face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not lightened by hope or just a hint of survival.
The disease brings an unfortunate certainty (and eventually brought Stephen Jay Gould) to Stephen.
As Andrew Morgan says, “the medoteliom does not threaten life. ”

China refuses to give Hong Kong the power to choose leadership - demonstrators promise revenge
In spite of the multiplying discussions on democratic reform on Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided not to allow the Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
It is likely that this step will trigger long-promise protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists have begun to organize and prepare only a few hours after this announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress basically allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
"We were not surprised, but we were angry," said the legislator, Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
They lied to people in Hong Kong.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritative regime.
In defence of the Chinese decision, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress Li Fei said that allowing public nomination in the Hong Kong elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong's administration to China, Beijing has promised that from 2017 onwards citizens will be able to vote for executive power.
China’s leaders presented Sunday’s decisions as a democratic breakthrough, since Hong Kong allows direct vote, but the decision also makes it clear that China’s leaders hold firmly in the hands of the nomination process of a committee that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And according to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which recorded one of the largest and most observed protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Most pro-democratic protests in Hong Kong are supported by the occupation movement of the Centre with love and peace, which the organizers threatened by closing the financial quarter, unless Beijing grants them general voting rights.
On Sunday night, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the occupation movement in the rain gathered before Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers reported that their movements were entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that in the coming weeks they would start waves of protests.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “has considered the occupation of the Centre as a last step in the event that all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We must be sorry to announce that all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted today, and that it is inevitable to occupy the Centre.
The Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for the announcement of Beijing for days, and on Sunday they have strengthened the protection of government headquarters and deployed police officers and barricades.
According to many Hong Kong’s population, the incitement of riots is a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from land increases competition in products and services.
There is also concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticise the occupation movement of the Central and say that their demonstrations threaten trade - a lifeboat of Hong Kong.
“The protest he is talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,” says the politician Regina Ip, who criticises the movement for a long time.
We don't want the fear of Hong Kong getting out of control.
Such perception could damage investment.
China’s state media has also come up with reports in recent days that democratic activists in Hong Kong depict as subversive Western-led agents.
In the summer, the activists organised an unofficial referendum on voting rights with 780 000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest pro-democratic demonstrations in the history of the area.
Electoral agitation?
The League of Jihlava bears its name according to the political movement
In the regional town of Vysočina, a small excavation is played by some 1,600 amateur athletes.
And their highest competition is now called Together for the Jihlava League.
She got her name according to one movement that goes to the October municipal elections.
In addition, Jan Mrák is the boss of a small excavated Jihlava.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," said Mrak.
The situation around the first league of the small excavators was already addressed by lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and recommended changing the system of distribution of subsidies.
A small excavator got about a million crowns last year, according to the city's website.
Even this year, it's an amount in hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not in breach of the law or the rules of the Magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Authority to amend the rules on the allocation of grants and subsidies," said the spokesperson of the Radek Tulis Magistrate.
To draw subsidies from the city and at the same time to express as a small-earned support in the elections of one political party, I don't think that's gonna work anymore.
A similar requirement for politicians has not yet come to the highland "big" football.
It would be necessary to create a ČSSD circuitry, ODS division or KDU-ČSL 1.
And the class and the like?
I wouldn't be up for it.
On the contrary, I would like the sponsors from among companies to turn to us," said Miroslav Vrzáček, president of the Regional Football Association.
Little football bosses don't let the other sides and the league name movement
According to the players, this sport of Jihlava would deserve its own area with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the pitch is not ours, we are there in rent," said Ondrej Lapeš of Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the Czech Mill.
But there will be, for example, a senseless area for skiers, which are about 50 of them, in my opinion," said Mrák.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small excavator uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošický and Na Stoupách, which are owned by the city.
We want to build a playground that has the maximum use.
We are planning to upgrade or build sports facilities at schools that will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been enormous progress over the past few years for a little kick," added Eczemal.
Other political parties in league names will not appear according to Jan Mráka.
We've got restrictions.
If one of the industries enters our partnership, we don't put the other in partnership anymore," he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider that at least an unfortunate step," said a member of the council committee for sport Karel Voldan.

American tradition penetrates university life - freshmen can fly jets
We are pleased that we can respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in Britain.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the University, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or cars such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service had a security side.
Servis is the ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to ensuring that with our VIF (very important freshman) options this year we will ensure students that they arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and maximum luxury.
The spokesperson of the company said that since the services had just started, they had no reservations yet, but he added: “Students will start making reservations in the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that although students are paying an annual education fee of 9000 pounds, the company expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, today's students are different when it comes to expectations and wishes - it's more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the WIFI program is exactly the right way to achieve this.
But the National Union of Students criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Union for Higher Education, noted: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
A lot of students who enter the university this month have to deal with the financial crisis before they fire thousands of pounds for something as simple as coming to college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic needs.
Feminists are opposed to racism and police behavior after events in Ferguson
At the beginning of the month, he killed a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, an unarmed young man.
The people who are waiting for a funeral with their hands up and down are screaming, "Hands up, don't shoot!"
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri due to the shooting of an unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Peréz reported a shift in the online discussions of the white feminists.
She found that when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists favor the race.
With the increasing tension in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perézová noted that the white women’s reaction is 100% focused on the race.
Compared to the reactions of the black women shortly after the shooting of 9 August, personal articles with headings such as "the thinking of a white woman over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not only about oppressing women" appeared relatively late.
But according to Perez, this represents an important change.
"I think there are not many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privileges on such a level," she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves to what had happened.
For the crisis we face, it's characteristic because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially defined that they had to point it out.
According to a professor of English at the State University of Ohio, Coritha Mitchell brought to light Ferguson the problems African-Americans have to face every day and are not perceived as "female questions" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post on Facebook funny stories from my life with my partner and it'll get 150 pounds from people from all over the world," Mitchell said.
When I write something about the colorful being trapped in their own country, it's deafening silence.
"How is it possible that a woman can speak publicly about relationships, but not about security in the public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with the question of race, sex and sexuality in American history, there is no question of race and gender dichotomy.
In her opinion, black women could not afford luxury to divide the following problems: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Although the white women today associate the question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor presenting the female question and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched, and the reason was almost all the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
To justify lynching, you needed the cooperation of white women.
According to Hattery, the dissolution between white women and black women came when a fighter for electoral law like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks can have the right to vote.
"They decided to place their cards on women's voting rights and focus on blacks' rights later," Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We've never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after the women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to organise against lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after the blacks first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the response of white feminists to the questions raised in Ferguson - the question of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists had to "compensate" questions that black women faced generations.
"It wouldn't be great if activists in these areas [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?" said Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists, who have done their careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception, are now finding out what that means.
Important feminist activists like Gloria Steinem took two weeks after Michael Brown was shot by Facebook, where they published Rebecca Carroll's column from Guardian, demanding that white Americans protest more aggressively against racism.
"I hope that women, who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers of society - and the views of a race that differ significantly in public opinion surveys - will seek change," Steinem wrote.
Despite Steinem’s intersectual feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, some people are confusing about the question of race in America.
An expert at the American Enterprise Institute Christina Sommers, the author of the book “Who Stole Feminism?”, said She The People that young men in the United States, especially young color men, are “more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the comments of Steinem’s party to Ferguson face the criticism that she had raised earlier.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program My Brother's Keeper, which was supposed to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it triggered a lot of feminists, including Gloria Steinem's angry reaction.
The police's relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes at the fore of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police detained almost 63 000 unaccompanied youths in the southwest of the country this year, the issue of reform came up again with immigration laws - this time as a female question.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of the Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for the reform of immigration laws, said that in order to be able to raise the question as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrants.
"He speaks for himself," says Mercado.
Since most work permits are granted to men, women who come with them will find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable in terms of domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a voice in women's organisations," she said.
Pig residence in Ipswichi for sale
The real estate office removed a picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, it was rested in the pig's living room.
One-room separate house, which is for sale for £120,000, is on a private road in Ipswichi.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which it rests with its head on the couch of the pig.
Connells' real estate office said the pig in the photograph was a pet owner.
"The photo was accidentally found there, so it was already removed," said the spokesperson of the office.
In the real estate information Connells described the former prayer house as "a unique single-bedroom house."
Although the office has already removed a photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest in social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest
Harvey's lottery player gets a million.
There's a search for a new millionaire in the Southeast of Perth, one lucky guy taking home 1.1 million dollars from the Saturday lottery campaign.
Traficas in Harvey had been lucky for the second time in five years, the last time in November 2009 it was about winning one million dollars.
But the lucky winner still has to sign in.
The store owner Steve Forward said the whole town was talking about winning in the southwest of Perth.
It's the main topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners in Western Australia split one win last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a player in Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August, and only a few weeks earlier a couple in Belmont won an incredible 7.5 million dollars.
The winning couple had been betting for 20 years and said that winning would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
A millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only lottery winner in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The Deutsche Bahn trains won't leave tonight.
Drivers want higher wages
In his press release, the GDL referred to the protest as a warning strike for which he deliberately chose time outside the traffic stop.
The GDL takes account of many people who return from the weekend after the rails only during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people arriving during the day's work," said the union on Monday morning in a press release to announce the strike.
"Our first strike should hit mainly freight transport, less passengers," added the GDL.
DB has not yet published the official response to the strike announcement.
It is not even clear how the protest action will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
Unions demand a five-percent increase in the wages of drivers and a two-hour cut in working hours per week.
Today, the average salary of drivers varies between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998,000 and 1.27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years worked.
The drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DBs refuse to accept wage growth in shortening their working hours.
They stress that the wage assessment of the drivers must be developed in the same way as for other railway personnel with DB not counting the shortening of the working week.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why he ended up at the Barum Rally.
What exactly happened?
It was a material flaw.
The car was brand-new, so I didn't even think something like this would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust have been repaired temporarily and continued at a slower pace in the service, where the mechanics would have replaced it?
If we went straight there, yes.
But we had two more eras waiting, and we couldn't.
It's got a high temperature, and the risk of a car starting to burn is high.
I can't afford that.
At full speed, you've done five speed tests.
How did they impress you?
Very good.
I felt young.
We were fast, and I didn't cross the vintage.
Everything was caused by the fact that we've been piping the car for over six months to be on some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You started it so that you could actually think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had a win.
The job didn't come in vain.
On the other hand, the result that we could think about did not come up.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the tech said no.
You weren't the only one who left early for the first time.
It was also the foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi.
Did it surprise you that so many favorites have stepped down?
Yes.
It was a shame for the audience, especially because the race was over.
Jaromír Tarabus, who you're planning a car, has been moving on the top for a long time.
But he paid off the track and took a nearly two-minute mano.
How were you satisfied with his performance?
It's a shame because he could repeat the degree of winners.
I mean, it was the first two times.
But even Mira confirmed that we've prepared the car well.
He was driving very fast.
Just a year ago, you announced the end of your career, yet you showed up at the start of the Barum Rally.
Can you feel good about driving again to make a regular player of rally races?
Not at this point.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race, and I still didn't get it.
I decided I'd go back.
It was my 19th start here, and if there's another chance in a year, I guess I'll go for it.
But I don't think about anything else.
A lot of people came to the track just for you.
Did it please you?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, kept asking if I'd go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What's waiting for you after Barumce?
The team's moving on.
Next week, we'll go to Vyskov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow Honza Sýkora's factory for this race.
With Mira, we have a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We're gonna have to do this next year.
Can you give me a hint?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican rally was part of the World Cup, you reached your peak in the series by the fifth place.
Doesn't it tempt you to try out the tracks there again?
He's not.
The oral agreement with the employer may be a problem
Unfortunately, you have not been asked to issue a certificate of incapacity from your doctor, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot carry out work duties for health reasons.
Moreover, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
It was then agreed that the days would be recorded as a holiday, but the agreement was only oral.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have the employer's consent confirmed in writing, in practice this procedure has proved successful.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to the taking of leave, as in your case, may be considered to be a long-term unexcused absence of work, therefore a reason to immediately cancel the employment relationship under Section 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute over an agreement with your employer, you are so lacking evidence.
The working relationship with you has not been cancelled according to § 53, only you have given the days listed in the credit sheet as an unforgivable absence.
Unforgivable absence of a credit card has no the same consequences as §53 (e.g. the inability to take material security in unemployment), yet this makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend you to visit the doctor again and have him confirm in writing that there was an accident, which caused you to be incompetent (this is not a "incompetence", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present this document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is appropriate not to underestimate both the issue of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work and the early notification of the employer or the request for written consent to receive a holiday.
You'll avoid possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on its way back to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just a half way past Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the fence the second time after his right front tire burst in the 172nd round, and the race for him ended.
Stewart brought a damaged car to the garage, didn't tell the reporters and left.
His team leader Chad Johnston said that car number 14 is disappointed, but he will now focus on a race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
"I would like us to have a better performance and a better conclusion," said Johnston.
We're gonna go to Richmond and hope we can do better.
Stewart bumped into the bailout for the first time in a Sunday night race after a collision with Kyle Busch, which required repairing the right side of his car.
"We put hope for a good ending into today's race," said Johnston, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second crash, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed up and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to come back this weekend and needed to win either a race in Atlanta or the following race in Richmond to catch up with the place in the table.
He returned to the race during an investigation into the tragic accident in which the 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who drove Stewart into the road during the race.
The authorities said it would take at least two more weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
So far, it hasn't been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The triple champion had a warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, worked at the beginning of the race on 10th and then even on 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, with Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, went out of the second corner and crashed into Stewart, sending both cars to the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to number 21.
Prague has selected a new habitat manager taxi, earns 12.3 million
Prague completed the selection procedure for the new taxi station administrator.
For 103 parking stations, it will receive approximately CZK 12.3 million a year.
Until recently, 150,000 crowns were selected for the same taxi driver's seats each year.
Councilman Lukáš Manhart informed about this (TOP 09).
Formerly, the city used a draw to select the administrators.
The winner then got a lease for a flat amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
It currently decides the amount of the offer.
"A year after the termination of the initial lease contracts and the opening of the selection procedures, it has been proven that the new lease system is much more favourable and fairer for Prague," claims the councillor.
The most expensive spot is Na Perstín
The highest price was offered to the interested parties for a post on Na Perštýn Street.
They'll pay CZK 2.1 million a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for places outside the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules on rental of taxis were adopted by the council in autumn 2012 and the original lease contracts were terminated last summer.
The selection procedure took place in four waves and the new administrator found 29 posts.
For the second time this year, we had to clean the well.
We let her go every time, creating a practically second pond around the cabin.
Then we poured Savo in there.
Unbelievable smell!
Our well in the basement has always provided enough beautiful scented water.
And that wasn't how professionally done, Grandpa excavated her with his help.
A long time ago.
She was just for three years, and in total she was, like, everything in the cabin, but like I said.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we exhausted the water.
She deserved it when she was standing there for months.
But even then, we thought the water didn't smell like water.
We were wondering if something fell in there.
In the place where the pump was passing, it was possible at a bit of bad luck, there the plate was quite untouched, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing visible in the water, and we lit it to the bottom.
So we let her go again and cleaned her up.
Of course, we've improved the improvized seal around the pump tube.
We noticed strange things in the basement.
There was a taped package on the ground with some dice on it.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a drool mouse.
At the ceiling, in places where the winds are, Grandpa's invention, there were leftovers of fish!
And heavy jets!
Our basement's pretty cool, too.
Some people would think Grandpa was just digging up the cabin.
And he wouldn't be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just suffocated sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
It's mostly boats.
And wheels.
And sun beds on the beach.
The door with wide gaps was usually open, as someone went there all the time.
At the ceiling, several of the above mentioned vents.
Without a net, the birds usually go there and build nests on the beams.
It's useless to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to luft, and that's it.
Now, of course, even the luft didn't help.
The whole basement smelled.
So we cleaned the entire basement.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We threw away the stuff that was around: the boards, the heraclite board, and so on.
Our cottage was greeted by a passing disinfectant.
We were wondering who might have dragged the disgusting leftovers out there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers from here in the village.
It would be hard for her to come here for a snack.
My grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who's not quite right.
Didn't he put the disgustingness in the air?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to guard the basement and the well and check regularly.
After a few days, everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests were done, but it was good.
Pulling water out of a forest well is nothing I want to do for a long time.
We once heard our bitch's terrible anxieties.
Mom looked out of the balcony and saw a long black hose in the grass next to the porch.
The line jumped over her and squealed like a fool.
My mom used to scold her because she thought Réza dug the waste hose out of the sink.
But all of a sudden, the hose was partially tangled in the club and partly tangled up.
There's been a leak on the balcony.
The book got a hysteric attack.
We ran down.
The bug, long enough over a meter and fat as a bulldog, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Réza was holding her back.
It wasn't clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the whole family's superstition, she probably said, "Let's eat it when we're hungry," and she's elegantly stretched her breath into the basement.
We went to see her.
She jumped over the well like lightning.
By the way, we recorded another stinking package on her board.
Smells like a fish.
She wasn't there yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit of a shay.
And we locked the basement during the day.
That he would...
We went out there and we all sat in one breath.
We didn't wait long.
It shitted out behind the well.
First, a flat head appeared with yellow moons on its neck.
Then she threw herself out on the well for a long time.
She got around the pump and started getting in.
Fired employee took revenge, bought laptops on the company and sold them
A burned-out employee bought a computer company and then sold it.
He could spend the money he was getting before the police were arrested.
Within a short period of time, a man purchased in 12 cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
"He took the notebooks after the takeover to Olomouc, where he sold them after the bazaars," said the Chief Commissioner of the Šumper police, Rostislav Brückner.
The motive for fraud was the revenge of the employer for the release and the profit of the money.
"In an interview, he told us that he used the money to pay off the loans," said Brückner.
Police have also found out that a fraud is a pathological player who has repeatedly been treated for psychiatry.
So the money could also have ended up in payloads or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is, we didn't find any money with him," the Commissioner said.
A fraud who was already punished for theft now threatens to stay in prison for one year or five years.
The police have not yet informed whether there is a threat of punishment to the bazaars who bought and sold laptops under the price.
"It is true that they have taken over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," said the Commissioner.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, just a little bit longer, you can do it, or as I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers prepared some changes for us.
The biggest was the change of route that brought the target to the river, instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of Rungo.cz the team, but I was going to experience it on the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand where we took pictures together and made videos.
To reach perfection from the other side, I accepted the role of a personal conductor.
My friend Katya and I have been obediently ranked at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
My friends and I said hello to the sector for faster runners.
There's not much time left.
A couple of hot dogs, turn on the athletes, count down and start!
Shoutings of joy, but instead of a quick start, the hooves followed the hooves to the starting line.
After five minutes we reach the gate, turn on the measurements and run at a speed of ten.
We're intertwining with the yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, are running their first race.
So far, everyone looks fresh, slowly falling sun in the sky adds a view of Vyšehrad almost to kite breath.
The pulsating flesh stretching down the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running.
The waterfront between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre has traditionally begun to show who has the strength.
The light hill on Palacké Square forces many runners to slow down or go into the walk.
I see a police escort just before I cross to the Theatre, and right behind it is the Vítek Pavlišta flying at an incredible pace to the finish.
I can hear the admirable sighing of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to slap me, but right before that, my leg is going to drill and our hands are going to pass.
The downhill of the Theatre Street gives you a chance to have a short rest and respiration.
It's necessary that there are places in front of us where the views blow my breath.
The turning on the bridge of Manes shows Prague in the beauty of the setting sun.
I'm not breathing, and my legs are almost alone.
A moment of truth comes after the first snack.
During the crossing of the road, Katya takes the curb and shows the jump by the swim.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm running a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about the pain.
It rises and continues on the Goat Street, it is one of the narrowest places of the track, although at this stage of the race there is no such a rush, yet it is necessary to monitor the surroundings well.
I don't know yet that the concept of the narrowest place gets its true meaning later.
We are encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners at the Dust Gate.
I'm trying to applaud anyone who offers a hand, and I'm doing it to Katya, because ten applause fans is like half an energy bar.
It's really working, we're speeding up again, and even though we're going down pretty hard, now we've got a fighter run.
We're running dozens of runners when I'm passing someone especially tired, trying to cheer him up with a few words: "Come on, just a little bit longer, you can do it!"
No one's running past the last snack, we're speeding up.
So far, we've been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there's nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the finish line will hurt, but we really need to get it done.
The sun has slowly set and the end of the day is symbolically slowly ending the race.
Last run to the bridge, turn around, and just a straight line to the finish line.
The tempo we're running is surprising to me, where does it come from in that girl?
"Come on, let's go under 1 3 o'clock, let's work!" I'm calling.
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
One hour thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done?
Coach set a limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under plan.
Which is a great result.
I'm helping her with a railing where she's resting for a while.
It shows exhaustion, but also happiness from well done performance.
After a while, I'm slowly taking her out of the area of the target.
The euphoria won't let us think about the press in the closet passages.
It shows here that the Goat Street wasn't the narrowest place.
That's what's going to happen up here, with almost ten thousand runners stuffed into it.
If someone doesn't like crowds, it's no place for him.
After a while, I'm losing my mind and wondering if the beautiful views and the more interesting route was worth what was going on in the finish.
I know from my own experience that organizing a race is no fun.
If there are ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the whole centre of Prague for all transport, it is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route has shown many interesting places to runners, but it has also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped in the Yellow Baths has moved between runners and the race itself.
The organizers around the track and the random viewers stepped her up on every metro track.
Unfortunately, in the city run through the historical centre, obstacles that cannot be removed must be expected, but the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered on the one hand by the wall and on the other by the river, I do not consider the best solution.
If I tell myself that the race ended with a goal, I'm going to evaluate it as a very successful one.
The goal was a bit of a fear for the health involved, but in the end everything turned out well.
Tell us in the discussion if you liked the route and what you're saying about the situation in the finish line.
Prison overseers in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison workers throughout Bulgaria attended a national protest assembly in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
The peaceful demonstration was repeated by their request for the reintroduction of the original working conditions that have recently changed.
Higher salaries are also included in the list of requirements to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
The overseers of the month symbolically protested against new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty - four - hour shifts.
Although prison overseers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian State Radio (BNR) informed them.
"The negotiations are still ongoing," said the head of the Directorate-General of Prison Service Rosen Zhelyazkov.
It is expected that members of the Federation of Workers' Organisations at the Ministry of Interior will also join the protests of prison staff.
Why the universe can have more dimensions and we can't see them.
The physicists don't usually write best sellers, but Brian Green from Columbia University managed to hit the black in 1999.
His book Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the Housian problems that a number of theoretical physicists are dealing with today - trying to unite two perfectly functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that in the case of a search for a unified physical theory, it is not a boring story.
The physics fundamental problem between the two key theories (for at this point our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) solves and solves ingeniously that it is worth telling even the laymen.
In addition, Greene dealt with the complex material so fresh and engaging that he could not be blamed for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, the structure of the universe and the Hidden Reality have been largely corrected by his "missive" in the next two books.
Apparently, neither the author would object to his book taking care of faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the elegant universe provides almost everything that an informed layman with ambition should understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be only a little more lively in this area (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go to "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter the Green with the unviolently open doors of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may certainly sound foolish, fantastic, strangely or mystical.
Yet it is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand that, let us for a moment turn our eyesight from the universe as a whole to something more groundy, specifically to a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine that you stretch a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and follow the whole scenery from a half-mile distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From this distance, you can easily see the long in the horizontal direction of the hose, but unless you are suffering from sharpness of vision, you can hardly tell the thickness of the hose.
Given its long distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at a given moment, you will answer it with only one indication: the distance of the ant from the left (or the right) end of the hose.
All we're trying to say is that from a half-mile distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we enlarge everything, we'll suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle opening a hose.
In this enlarged view, it is clear that an ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in a well-known left-right dimension after the length of the hose, but also in the "dimensional in/from direction of movement of the hourly hands", i.e. around the circular section of the hose.
You're beginning to understand that you have to enter two numbers to determine the position of a small ant: how far it is from the end of the hose and where it is on the circle opening the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note. Experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the faulty string theory.
Non-driving aspects are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, marked with a circular arrow, is short and winding.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The dimension along the hose is long and easily visible.
The dimension of the opening circuit of the hose is short, "circumcised" and less noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates the important characteristic of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or on the contrary small, winding and much worse observable.
Of course, in the above case, we didn't just think to reveal the "stunned" dimension of the opening tube thickness.
All you had to do was take a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would only reveal a twisted dimension with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein his article, in which he spoke with the stunning idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three of us all known dimensions.
His radical statement, Kaluza, justified by providing an elegant and convincing framework for Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of veto into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately, the question of how this Kaluz observation goes along with the obvious fact that we are seeing just three dimensions of space is being imposed.
The answer Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and made clear by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the claim that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and winding dimensions.
This means that as well as the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has a large, large and slightly visible three dimensions, which we are aware of at any moment of existence.
But by analogy with the circular circuit of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, firmly wrapped into space so small that they have remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental devices.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz' remarkable proposal, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine if we draw a relatively thick line of circles on the perimeter of the hose.
The appearance of the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With telescopes now, we will reveal the pungent dimension even easier, because we will see the motive in Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, together a four-space dimension.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, note the illustration of Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space similar to that we increased the surface of the hose.
Each of the following levels represents a huge enlargement of the geometry of the space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of magnification) if they are wound up in enough space; this explains that we have not seen them directly yet.
The square network depicts a commonly known "big" dimension, while the circle represents a new, tiny and winding dimension.
Just like loops of threads in a densely woven carpet, even these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - we have only drawn them to the intersections in the square network because of our viewability.
The background of Figure 4 represents the commonly known structure of the space - the ordinary world around us - on such standard scales as meters, illustrated by the side of a small square in a square network.
In each of the following pictures we will focus on the small area of the picture preceding it; we will enlarge it to become visible.
At first, nothing special is happening, as we see in the first few levels of enlargement.
But if we follow the microscopic properties of the geometry of the space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we see a new, circle-shaped dimension, similar to loops of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, just like the hose has a circular circuit at every point of its length.
In the interests of rationality, we have defined the circular dimension only in some, regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 Kaluzova and Klein's idea of a microscopic structure of the geometry of space summarizes.
The resemblance with the hose is obvious, although there are also important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (from which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
What's even more important is that we're talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circular dimension is extremely miniature, identifying it is - as well as the circumference of the hose - much harder than observing the apparent, large and large dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it beyond the power of our most modern instrument for magnification.
But the most important thing is that the additional dimension is not just an oblique bump inside the normal dimensions, as two-dimensional illustrations mistakenly suggest.
The circular dimension is a new dimension, which exists at every point in three normal large dimensions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions independent as are the dimensions of the top-downs, left-right and front-back independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
Sufficiently small ants could move in all four dimensions and we would need four figures to determine his position, except for three common positions in a circular dimension; if we count even time, then data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

To our surprise, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kalus and Klein’s reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional screwed-up dimensions if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The state-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a billion billionth of a meter.
We can barely observe a smaller, wrought dimension.
In 1926 Klein combined the original Kaluz idea with several ideas from just-born quantum mechanics.
His calculations indicated that the additional circular dimension could be the size of approximately one Planck's length, which is far beyond the distinguishing ability of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohn Honza Homola advises how to practice on an electric guitar: 5th part
The whole essence of the "twelveth" lies in a twelve-titious harmonious form, which you can freely repeat.
He who gropes in the theory of music will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola, or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By educating a puppet and a puppet conductor whose facebook profile can be traced here, they have been living as a graphic designer since graduation 20 years ago.
He's a guitarist at Wohn, which I'm afraid is impossible to leave.
The guitarist is after the father, as is Brother Matěj, the leader of the Wohne.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can come up with anything, then you can apply it to the harmonious model of the twelve," advises Honza.
If you add another string, you can change the figure again.
All you have to do is listen and watch Honza, what can come up with a twelfth harmony on two strings, and how it's starting to sound.
If you take the third string, you can make some songs with the melody.
When you finally add the fourth one, beware of the change in tuning, warns Honza in the video.
Next time, Honza will go back to the pentatonics and you'll try to put her back together with the 12th.
So exercise her honestly.
As best as possible, you will read in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not for a big celebration, recognizes the castle's Dvorak
We take the point, and we're happy for it.
The first half had more chances of us, the second homeman," said the attacker, who scored from the penalty kick this time.
You weren't nervous when he was playing, but he was accompanied by a huge whistle?
I wasn't particularly aware of it, although at the second goal where there are domestic fans, it'd probably be worse.
You settled the penalty half an hour later, but you also got the goal out of penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept the beginning, we were passive, we came out of that corner, and then we had a penalty.
You picked up after her, and the first half was a better team that had more chances.
Why did it change after the break?
It's hard to tell.
I agree that we played well after the scored goal until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep up the pace of the game, but we couldn't.
To tell you the truth, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the housewives said something about their game at a break, probably they were not very happy with her.
You only scored for the first time on the field of your opponents, while you may not have scored a goal at home.
Why is it so different?
I don't think that's the difference, but it's up to us to deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, that's another category.
Four games you've been waiting for a goal, weren't you afraid that after the last game could be similar?
I don't think so, but of course we're glad that since the last game, we don't have to talk about waiting for a goal.
Now we've added more without waiting, but there's still only three in six games, which is not yet a big celebration.
Island - lava flows from a kilometer away crater.
The lava leaving to the surface in the area of Holuhraun near the iceberg Vatnajökull, flows through the underground tunnel from a kilometer away crater.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now concerns scientists most...
For now, the situation remains unchanged.
Since yesterday morning (31.8)
2014) still leaves the crack of approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
However, scientists are concerned that the lava tunnel could also be opened in places under the ice.
If this were to happen, with the same intensity as the current eruptions, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökulsá a Fjöllum and on other rivers.
There's a strong smell of sulphur in the vicinity of the eruption, and there's a cloud of steam and gas rising from the cracks.
This is certainly not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the fimmvörðuhals in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are much more gases," says Vulcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, and in the morning there was almost no wind.
Sandstorm tracks were washed with rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
The orange grade (second highest) for Bárðarbung and yellow (third) for Askja applies to air operations.

Walking through the wings
Airday in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 aerobat, Peggy Walentin, who climbed out of the cockpit to the castle on the upper wing of the two-plane, as well as between the wings.
There it is referred only to the strength of the muscles.
The flight day in Cheb has been held for the fifth time this year and the organizers have again managed to prepare some interesting air pieces.
The premiere at the oldest Czech airport was held not only "walking on wings" by German acrobat Peggy Valentine, but also by legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or aircraft Beechcraft 18.
He drew attention to himself with his shining cover.
The acrobat called Wingwalking comes from the United States.
After World War I, many former war pilots tried to enforce.
But he was banned because of a large number of fatal injuries.
But today he is slowly returning to the flight days program.
Peggy climbs from the cockpit to the upper wing after takeoff.
That's where he's doing all kinds of exercises.
At the end of the show, she will move to space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues," Luděk Matíček from Chebské Ultralight Club and the organizer of the flight day.
The Boeing Stearman 75 E pilot is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the following performance of the fighter Mustang was a famous cherry on the cake.
Legendary fighter came to the surface with Grippeny Army of the Czech Republic in a curtain (so called numbers).
This line-up was first seen by air fans in the Czech Republic.
The pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone the breathtaking acrobatics with an aircraft from 1945.
He was made during the war, but he probably never took part in it.
He was included in the military reserves.
Since 1963 he has been in the civil realm.
Even as a racing aircraft.
Today he has his home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradiště.
There is also another pearl of the Cheb flight day, two-engineed Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, a massive machine failed to overlook.
His polished aluminum cover shone to a distance.
He also gained the machine Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colors of the French air force.
A small transport aircraft caught off guard for a canceled Turbolet and from the German Hofu brought part of the German delegation on the flight day.
The German neighbors in Cheb have demonstrated with the redesigned aircraft As 18T or a three-member formation of the Bücker Jungmann two-planes.
Lucie Borhy: Dramatic return from camera!
Parental concerns have been exchanged by Lucie Borhy at least for the work night.
Stress or nervousness - blonde moderator knows none of this clearly.
She was doing well with the modernized television news, as if she hadn't stopped with him for two months!
It's only been two weeks since the blonde ended on six Sundays, where women experience the most stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in the main news session of TV Nova.
A regular return is due to be made by Lightning.cz in a month.
After all, only her daughter Linda needs her now more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy's back on the TV screen, and it was a black hit.
Exhibition for a year in Prague?
Hala would sell out, she's planning a bachelor party.
It would be dignified if something like this happened during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands," said the Jihlava after the exhibition called the Golden match, in which the stunning Nagan team reunited.
Even the players who participated in the gold hat trick.
Players would like that, wouldn't they?
Absolutely.
It would just be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, during the tournament, you can find one or two days when it is completely free and where such a match could be mixed.
We'll tell Gum (Jirí Šlégr) or Béď Ščerban (organizer of the Jihlava game) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with New Jersey playoffs?
So if I fly in like this...
You don't want to play in the representation.
Or did the Jihlava meeting change your mind?
Representations and exhibition games are two different things and the representations are decisive performances.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but the performances are decisive, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have it, not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagan reunion?
Only the gamer meeting was great.
You've come to life with stories and had a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for the hockey team.
Of course, the most important one was the honor of Ivan Hlink.
And it's good to remind you of the history of our hockey and that one generation goes away, which was really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the grid.
Can you still remember your first team game?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and three youths: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we joined one three.
It was the first representative start for everyone.
Well, if we were to dominate in some way, that's impossible to say.
The Jihlava was caught by Dominik Hašek after a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashan will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can't (Hašek criticized Jagra for reasons why he decided to end up in the representation).
He's done a great job, too.
While you were training with me one night and there he was sore.
And now he's got a great catch.
First the US and then the Netherlands, the footballers start to qualify
On Monday morning, prominent guests came to the hotel.
The people could see the goalie Petr Čech of Chelsea, the representative coach Pavel Vrba...
And there, the character in the black hat, that's Tomáš Rosický!
Deputy Arsenal and representative captain arrived at the meeting around half past half past twelve.
We have a beautiful fight against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn't be happy?" he said, when he was already present in front of journalists in the representation kit.
Czech Representation Program
Monday 1st September: beginning of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2nd September: Training open to fans (18:30, Summer) Autogrammada (20:00)
Wednesday 3rd September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9th September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) End of Meeting
Rosický and spol. can support fans before the Wednesday match against the USA (20:15).
The representation was opened for them by Tuesday training, which starts at Summer at 6:30 p.m.
And he will be followed by an autograph, which Rosický and Czechs will not miss.
Otherwise, this meeting of the national team will be quieter.
Which praises Coach Vrba, who complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now let's focus on the Netherlands.
It's an advantage when you have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that haven't been so long until now," Vrba, who is officially leading the national team since January, praised.
The Czech football team will be accompanied by a Musketeer image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The representation has three games under Vrba, all of them preparatory.
She tied 2:2 with Norway and Finland, and lost 1:2 to Austria.
However, these results have not yet been important.
That's it now.
The match with the Netherlands will launch the qualification for the European Championship 2016.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could even handle the general against the US.
The first six months were to get to know each other.
The results are important now.
We must think about being successful," Vrba said.
The only player of the 23-member nomination who has health problems is David Lafata's attacker.
He's concerned about the temperature.
If he didn't make it to the U.S. Wednesday game, Coach Vrba would have called another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how she thought she was going to die after a bad diagnosis for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her growing up believing that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) - a group of hereditary disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK’s Charity Organization stated that bad diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT, because very little is known about disease.
In the United Kingdom, CMT is thought to be suffering from some 23,000 people, which may manifest symptoms in the area of motorism such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
The affected may also experience inability or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA) - a disease that had a very bad prognosis.
She believed that by the time she celebrated her 18th birthday, she would be tied to a wheelchair, and dead before she was 30.
The mother of two children, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew that I could not do the same things as others.
I fell every day, and it took me longer.
I've never been able to ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids, and I was bullyed at school for walking and running."
When Rodgers was thirteen and was after several surgeries that were supposed to release her tendons and straighten her feet, she used her doctor to leave the room, and she looked into her file where she found out that she was suffering from the FA.
"I felt guilty because I was snooping, so I didn't tell anyone, but when I got home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association," he says.
When they answered, I was shocked, and I totally panicked.
I thought by the time I was 18, I'd end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I'm 25, I'd be dead, and in the meantime, I'd lose all my powers.
I was on my own, planning a funeral."
When she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not worsened as much as she anticipated, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up and hugged her and said: “Baby, I don’t think you have the disease, or else you’d be in a wheelchair.
I think it'll be something far less dangerous."
After a few genetic tests, it was discovered that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a child of happiness," she said.
The CMT UK Charity Organization has launched a month of CMT awareness to draw attention to this disease.
Businesses in the Washington area: taxes are being raised with economic turnover
The growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
And higher taxes.
According to a new survey, which was published last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country to accelerate economic recovery increased slightly last year and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia together spent $27.6 billion in fiscal year 2013 in state and local cash registers, which is 3.8% higher than the $26.6 billion in 2012.
Last year, the tax burden - both state and local - rose by 4.3% to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes decreased.
According to a study conducted by Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation political group, state taxes increased faster by 4.3% than local contributions by 3.9%.
More than half of the district's tax revenues, 56%, are from business tax, and 36% of Maryland's income is from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, shows proportionally the smallest tax revenue from business.
Researchers argue that the majority of tax revenue growth comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which this year after three consecutive years with an increase of -1 % increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from large states like California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
The companies in D.C., Maryland and Vrigina last year paid over $10 billion in both state and local property taxes, representing an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in the value of real estate does not so much drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax represents less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property tax represents almost half of state and local taxation.
“In Maryland, he owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the D.C. tax base, government or non-profit organizations, which do not pay taxes,” explained Douglas Lindholm, Executive Director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also appear to increase.
Companies in this region have published a business income tax of $2.3 billion, which increased from 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax, most in the region.
Although they are going in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow as quickly in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at national average level, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, 4.9%.
Only in Virginia was the tax increase below the average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has of all three districts (all of which have the same tax) the lowest taxation of corporate income, 6 %.
The tax rate of companies in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average of D.C. remains relatively high, to 9.975%.
A similar study carried out by the US Chamber of Commerce this year showed that Virginia had lower national and local taxes and overall a more favourable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. didn't evaluate the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia is facing the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as well as Virginia, and next year the tax will decrease to 5%.
If the State continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study with small entrepreneurs in Washington, Washington is doing better, and therefore higher state and local taxes are paid.
The business tax paid by small entrepreneurs as a personal income tax - the structure of compensation for rising prices, according to which most companies are organized - in D.C., Maryland and Virginia increased by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers argue that the trend and the national increase in business taxes are likely to continue next year, the overall tax revenue from sales for both the state and local governments will increase to 6.2% over the same period over the first three quarters of 2014.
Washington, however, may be lagging behind others because the reduction in state spending is taking its toll on the labour market.
What you missed: Europe's leader will be Tusk, Putin's Novoruska and Lafat's scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin called for a meeting on Novoruska
Russian President Vladimír Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the south-east of Ukraine, where government forces have encountered pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that, after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they would have a difficult return to the Russian market.
The support provided by the Western war on the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict according to him depends on Kiev, so it cannot tell when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions for Russia?
The Czech Republic has earned the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with the diplomats, is expected to propose the form of further endorsement of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, and decided on the EU summit at night for today.
Journalists were told by the permanent chairman of the meetings of Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to move the form of sanctions should be prepared already on Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuye will replace in December
At the European Union summit, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council, the so-called EU President, who manages the summits of the Member States.
From December to December for two and a half years, he will replace Herman Van Rompuy.
The head of European diplomacy is Catherine Ashton, Italian foreign minister Federica Mogherini.
Italy, which will become the Vice-President of the future European Commission, still needs to be confirmed by the European Parliament in its capacity.
Assisted death is reality in the Czech Republic, it's just not mentioned
Helping an incurable and long-term patient?
In Czech conditions, where laws do not permit euthanasia, this is legally impossible.
Yet, it is clear from the comments made by the doctors who addressed LN that they are hearing about such requests.
ALS: The hardest chapter in neurology, says the doctor about sclerosis
The Czech Republic suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) of approximately three hundred people, 21 patients undergo experimental treatment of stem cells in the Prague Motole.
We absolutely don't know if she'll be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, Motol neurologist.
It's about knowing the CIA's manuscript, they needed a war, writes HUML about shooting down the MH17 flight.
Member of the ČSSD Stanislav Huml has a clear record of who shot down the Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
According to him, it is clear that "the harsh sanctions that were declared in the light of the shooting down of a civilian aircraft with nearly 300 dead have deliberately caused the Ukrainian army".
According to the legislator, the CIA's manuscript is also available.
Unfulfilled promises.
The elections are coming and the parties are offering once again the impossible
End of homeless people on the streets, parking for every family and cable car over Prague.
Before each election, it is repeated: the parties promise impossible.
With the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are also pushing out who will prefer the voters.
The Lidovka.cz server has selected impossible promises from both present and past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkerque.
A fierce siege has begun
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak independent brigade moved to France.
Her commander Alois Liška has consistently requested the addition of technical equipment and the dispatch to the front.
The British Party finally complied with this and classified this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SOUHRN: Plzeň leads the league in front of the Prague "S", Liberec declassified Banník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, which leads to the point in front of both Prague's "S".
Changes in the top of the table caused the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the home league, defeating Jablonec with two Lafatal interventions.
The record win in the year was credited by Liberec, who shot up Banik Ostrava 6:0.

How to survive a return from vacation?
Take your time and get some sleep
The last days of vacation are before us.
Get used to coming back from a sunny beach or a cottage at a normal tempo can be for many nuts.
It may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are good tips on how to cope with a changed situation: not rush and enjoy a good sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "We're holding hands"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but today, her daughter said that she was not losing hope of being healed by an 18-year-old comedian.
"Thank you for your support and greetings," said Melissa Rivers in today's statement.
We're holding her fingers.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call for emergency services, according to which she had a cardiac arrest at the York Endoscopy in Upper East Side, according to the source.
Doctors deliberately keep it under sedation and under strict supervision until they are confident of its condition, which remains “serious”.
The reactions haven't kept each other waiting for long, including incredible support on the Internet from personalities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is a twisted headline
That the media is twisting the reality with their headlines, there is (desperately) no news.
I know the headlines "sell" the paper, but unfortunately I also know that many so-called "readers" are not reading anything else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, more accurate is the word pisses off.
This applies in particular to articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines "Israel Attacked Gaza" are quite common.
Only in the text will you read that the Israeli "attack" was a reaction to the missiles fired from Gaza, often at the time of the ceasefire.
That's when the headline "Both sides have broken the truce" comes up.
Does the journalistic community realize that by doing so, they are directly involved in anti-Semitic positions that are growing across Europe (and not only there)?
Not even 60 years have passed since the end of World War II.
So far, there are people who have survived the Shoo.
When I saw the videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans of "Jewish swine" and similar fealty, it stuck.
Does the world want to finish what didn't work for Hitler?
Do our journalists realize that after the Jews, they were destined for the destruction of the Bible?
Ladies and gentlemen, please give a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as "a watchdog of democracy".
Then defend her.
As long as he's here.
And also defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect your population.
How would you like our government to be preserved if one of our neighbours decided that the Czech nation would destroy and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also realize one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the territory of the State of Israel.
And they're fine.
If you ask them why they don't go between their own, like Gaza, they'll answer you, why would they do that?
In Israel, they have work, social security and top health care (I saw myself how the Arabs go to the top private hospital Hadassa, which is funded by the donations of Jews from all over the world, and are naturally treated there).
Hamas is also attacking his Arab brothers with his missiles.
The only real help Gaza, and thus this restless area, is to get rid of Hamas and disarm him.
And not to judge Israel, whether indirectly in headlines.
Tell us about Hamas's practices, his abuse of people as human shields.
Please note that Hamas aims to destroy the State of Israel at any cost.
Even at the expense of the death of innocent Arab children.
Tell them Hamas is on the list of world terrorist organizations.
Please note that, in nine years' time, the Gaza Authority could have been flourishing through humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, but for which Gaza’s administrators do not pay and even get angry that the power supply is sometimes interrupted at this time.
Had Hamas not invested money in underground tunnels to penetrate suicide attackers in Israel, but perhaps in the construction of housing houses, hospitals and schools, his Arab brothers from Gaza would have been much better off.
Amazon buys $1.04 billion Twitch
AMAZON just confirmed the statement of the Monday morning Information: Internet retailer - video producer and hundreds of other things - buys a video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement triggered a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to buy, but because it was expected to be a buyer to YouTube.
Three months ago, the sales of Twitche Google in one billion percent sure, and this connection looked natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago by Justin.tv, was forced to become a commonly used video streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who broadcast online transmissions from games - words of Business Insider “YouTube for live-transmitted playing”.
Interaface Twitche.
On YouTube there are already popular videos "Let's play", a species where wisers (mostly older) give games processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is, YouTube comes to a lot of tremble when it comes to Twitch, so the news that YouTube buysTwitch, doesn't get too excited was a textbook example of how an established company pays off potential competition.
The mystery is why the YouTube deal didn't work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at present is the expression of CEO Twitche Emmet Shear: “We chose Amazon because we believe in our society, has the same values and long-term vision and wants to help us fulfill it faster.”
The next mystery is, honestly, Twitch's incredible success.
For snobs like me who claim that sport rather than watching, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about games instead of real playing just watching.
It's one thing to watch a friend over his shoulder at 3:00 a.m. playing Resident Evil, and it's another thing to watch someone else get 20 hits in the head at Call of Duty.
All the games you could just watch.
The next problem is that a lot of today's most popular games are from the player's perspective, so looking at their record without you being able to control yourself, is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games, in which Rogers Bannisters of our e-time finish the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone's not a master of playing or humor, his channel on Twitchi probably won't be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch has 55 million visits a month and is the fourth at the peak of internet traffic.
How exactly will Amazon use this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch blends into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it would have once been to swallow YouTube.
But Twitch has something that any company would like to attract: hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Director Twitche Hear, Amazon and Twitch said, “they believe in the future of games,” and the media do not seem to be reluctant, nor as - swallowing - viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of American atheist vlogger Aron Ra.
This time on "Holy Scriptures are God's Word."
Attached original video.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by true human authors.
When the believers debate one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often put us before the question: Whom will you believe?
The alleged word of God, or the word of man?
It's as if human research is completely useless compared to the authority they think it has their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they talk about science.
And when they refer to "the Word of God," they refer to myths about God written by men.
If there really exists an intelligent with the creator for some purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be him who invented the genetic formulas that match it, and it must be him who supplied the other series of evidence that shows exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
It seems like he's trying to tell us something!
People couldn't create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, tell stories.
And it was the people who wrote all those texts that pretend to be the word of God.
Every supposed holy doctrine of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not gods.
People who were "motivated" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or maybe listened to the dictatorship of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone other than mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels, and not gods at all.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a person of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one book, the only scripture.
It would be known everywhere, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors could not measure such a work.
And people wouldn't have to trust her blindly, because she would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
She would constantly inspire every reader to unite the common faith.
If God had written it, we wouldn't have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the final truth, we have many different religions without common origins, and all of them are constantly falling apart into increasingly separate denominations, seeking disputed truths, and each one claims God’s guidance in some way, regardless of the continuing dissolution and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospel, the Islamic Koran, Baha'u'llah Kitab-i-Akdas, Zarathustrovy Avesty, the Sikh Adi-Granth, Mahabharat Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the book of Urantia are all considered to be "the absolute truth" and "the revealed word of the one true god" and the believers of each of them say that the others are astray.
The only logical explanation is probably that everyone is on the wrong track to a certain extent.
None of the above mentioned books have any advantage over others.
None of them have any evidence support, and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at West Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it isn't.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology (defence) because they contain irregularities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
So you can't say they're evidence of divine wisdom.
Many of them are pronouncing repulsive atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy - each of them may also contain prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore the subject of interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often politically motivated authors, explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, more like a mutual commentary.
We must once again point out that there are two different authors, whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He's right that Genesis has more than one author, and he's definitely not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish between four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five books of "Moses" and Moses do not credit any of them because they almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably Ezra) of several unrelated oral traditions less than 2500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological findings of the texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Heleneism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by docéts and ebionites and their completely different perspectives on Jesus, who eventually combined in a compromise called orthodox.
Other Christian groups such as the luciferians were scattered and discredited by other Bible revisions.
One of these adjustments relates to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Moses religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to mock and Ba'al Zebula, the "Lord of the Mount" changed to Belzebub the "Lord of the Much".
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became of the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions in the Nikaia House.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by simply lifting their hand, as if the reality of any matter could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way the canon evolved depended on what was read on Sundays in the then Christian centers.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Roman Church at the same time?
And they gradually discovered that they were approaching the same Gospel stories.
And so the core of the canon evolved from the narrow of the original church.
So the Council simply accepted as the Gospel any relevant stories that flowed between uneducated meats at that time.
But they also knowingly received more than ten books from the Bible, even though they reported on the books that were approved.
Among the rejected items we will find writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should God’s Word refer us to books that are only people’s words and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor here?
The Bible often refers to human authors.
But how could it be approved if God were the true author of this random blend of legends, parables and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by people and certainly not too enlightened, rather, on the contrary!
That's why so much of her content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, no matter how much it goes from beginning to end.
We're talking about people who believed snakes and donkeys could talk, believe in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology, and five elements of magic.
They thought if they used a magic rod to spray someone with blood, it would cure him from leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought rabbits were ruminants and bats are birds and whales are fish and pi is the whole number.
These people believed that if they showed pregnant cows striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book didn't know.
If the Bible were written by some higher being, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it were from a pen of a truly superior being and intended to be a literal history, then it would not contain anything that contains.
As a moral guide, he totally fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages who ignored or promoted animal cruelty, incest, enslavement, slave abuse, family abuse, child abuse, child violence, abortion, abortion, plenary, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice to race, nation, religion, sex and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming to do God's will.
But creatives are still ignoring all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any reality is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why?
Because if the creativeists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god either.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
Ironically, they reject God's "work" as "worship of creation instead of the Creator."
But they themselves consider the word of man to be the word of God and God himself, and even insist that their supposed "holy" books somehow refute God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist, and at the same time the Bible could be wrong because they cannot separate doctrine from the deity.
So it's a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations, as if these books were God himself, because they think they're his word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected into their allegedly "immutable word" of any god was invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified and often also deliberately altered and distorted by mere errorful people.

The participant of the bucket challenge dislodged her jaw
When she was pouring ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts, from the United Kingdom, screamed so much that she damaged her facial structure.
This bucket challenge failed.
The woman was hospitalized after screaming at the bucket challenge so she dislodged her jaw.
While she was pouring ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so intensely that she damaged her bone structure in her face.
"The water was so cold that I had to scream, but my jaw became stiff," she said for The Mirror.

The assailant at Chinese school stabbed nine people, three of whom died
A man named Chen, according to Nová China, broke into the primary school building in the morning and attacked around half an eleventh local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen then killed himself by jumping from a height, introduced New China with a reference to the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public therefore calls for greater security measures and better protection for children in a country where many married couples have only one child in line with government policy.
Zeman showed the kids in Lány how he had to sit at school
Ninth graders were taken to their class, where they and the teacher were waiting for the president to arrive.
Then he showed the kids how he had to sit in school by himself.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, which, fortunately, no longer awaits you, you are free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the first-timers a gift to the puzzles.

Minister of Education Marcel Chládek started a new school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
"This year I want to link Czech education more with Czech sport," one of the reasons for the first school day went to the north of Bohemia.
School management approached him at a hockey game in Litvínov a while ago.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to attend the beginning of the school year," said the Minister.
Minister of Education Marcel Chládek (ČSSD) began his school year at a private sports school in Litvínov.
115,000 freshmen entered the first classes this year.
A total of over 850 000 children will attend primary school and over 405,000 students will be educated in high school, according to the Ministry of Education.

Apple iCloud reportedly yielded to hackers, naked celebrity images made public
Image of the screen with the list of escape files
So far an anonymous user on the 4chan server publishes both naked and pornographic images of American celebrities, the U.S. server Mashable.com pointed out.
It was allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on the Apple servers, where disabled users recorded it by automatically backing up images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple hasn't spoken about the problem yet.
A part of the celebrity rejects the images as falsified, but has already admitted some of the images concerned.
These include actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for the title role of Katniss in the Hunger Games film series or Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played in, for example, the Deathtrap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use pictures and videos to enrich.
The footage was reported to be of interest to American magazines, but according to reports on the 4chan server, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web server, this is very likely a weakness in the security of iCloud.
On the GitHub server two days ago, a tool appeared that allowed to obtain passwords to user accounts through a gross force, i.e. automatic repetition of attempts to login with different passwords.
This tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to access different accounts before publishing this instrument.
The iCloudu users should therefore change their Apple ID password for preventive reasons.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length of at least 12 characters is appropriate.
The escape of naked celebrity images is considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secured many times better than computers in households or smaller companies, upload sensitive photos in unprotected form is unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos online or any other sensitive content, first encrypt files before upload.
It is also wise to set up the automatic backup of photos from your phone so that it can only run on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
So you will be able to move sensitive images "to safety" in time, and above all you will have the space to delete failed images, so they will not unnecessarily occupy the space in the online repository.
We offer a manual on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet to the readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valášek in PDF format.
A smart way to save money for a college script
Since the price for a university script for many students exceeds $1 000 a year, the upcoming second year student came with a smart way to cut costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from college classmates offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“A book on calculations, which normally costs 180 dollars, I won for a semester for ten and chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studied at the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the University Council, an average student spends over $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options to cope with these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes online shops and creative solutions such as Schroeder's.
On the rise is the lending of textbooks, which allows students to use the book for a semester, often with a significant discount, than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, operating more than 250 booksstores on campus sites, says that the lending of books has doubled since 2011.
Research in industry shows that around a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring semester, says Vice President Neebo Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the teaching texts are purchased according to the National Association of University Stores in University Bookstores.
Here's 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping online
The prices of some new books may be up to a third lower on the Internet than in the university bookstore.
The recommended prize of the ninth edition of the book "Calculus" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the Internet it is possible to buy a new one for $239.99 at Chegg.com.
Buy Used
If you don't mind other people's notes or wear and tear, the teaching texts used are appropriate.
At Chegg.com, "Calculus" is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says that Amazon.com paid for a used copy of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business" 42 cents.
The new one was selling for $48.
The University Teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, proposes that students check that older editions are acceptable with their teachers.
Sometimes changes aren't important for working at seminars.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the last version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, they are a popular alternative to buying used books also eBay Inc's Half.com.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering lending textbooks, if you treat them well, you do not forget to return them and you do not need to have them after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow "Calculus" for about $20 for the whole semester.
Meet the terms and conditions of the business in which you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlight or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to get a regular e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg lends "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, the best offers can be found by students of literary courses, because many classics are now available for free download, while natural science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go shopping.
Joe Gault, 29, who soon enters Pepperdine Law School, recommends following ISBN because it guarantees that you buy the right book.
Before you order a book online, make sure it's really in stock, Gault advises.
He found out on his own.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for a book from the university bookstore.
Bahna, all mud.
And then they found a chest of guns in the well at the end of the war.
The well is just outside St. George's church.
We discovered a plant around us, and we started pulling out an old stretch - about a metre and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay bottom, we hit the barrel," Radomil Novák said.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found out it's the torzo of an attacking German rifle used by SS units.
The find is reportedly unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were made until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand," Novák added.
All wooden constructions have broken down over time, which is why it is useless.
Of course, her body is preserved - it holds its shape.
How did it find out in the well?
There's one explanation.
Maybe it was dumped by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
Fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They dropped their weapons in the woods," thinks the locksmith.
The rifle was the only thing the Duha Jeseníks found in the well.
"There could be hand grenades, there were plenty of them everywhere, so we slowed down the excavation work, we carefully felt mud so there would be no disaster, but there was nothing else down there," Novak said.
The find will end up in a museum depository in a castle in the nearby Silesian Rudolfice.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
An exclusive interview with Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take this... I'm being called from Donetsk," he said, eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz, Ukrainian colonel-in-chief Volodymyr Ruban, or else the director of the Center for the Liberation of War Prisoners.
Colonel Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
At each such interruption, it was impossible to ignore the names of people, their numbers, or places where they are - or should be - that Ruban has specified with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
"That's it - go there," he finished one of the quick discussions with Donetsk and once again devoted to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a backup general, former fighter pilot and active participant in anti-government protests at Majdan.
Yesterday, when we had an interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists takes place twenty-four hours a day.
Currently.cz: Perhaps you know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their count to 30.
Of course, there can be many more.
Have you met a Czech prisoner during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have freed the captured Serbs, Dagestians, Chechens, one Swedes, Georgia... but not yet the Czech Republic.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captive countryman and we can set him free.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers to capture them?
They should understand that if, as Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists capture them, they will shoot them after questioning without mercy, as will any other foreigner.
The Separatists regard these men as mercenaries, and they think they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them, for example, Czech - they put him behind bars and treat him as a prisoner of war.
This guy's gonna make it.
The Ukrainian side is also acting like a state in the war.
A.cz: And how many of you have managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand correctly, in exchange.
Some sources say it's long over 100 men.
We've stopped counting how many people we've helped.
But we just freed them... from the war if they decide to continue their fights.
The rescuers are doctors, surgeons, but we certainly aren't.
That's how it is.
And there's more and more every day.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, maybe four or five.
And it doesn't always have to be about trading.
Sometimes a simple human request is enough to release the prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority with pro-Russian separatists and even trust... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect for both sides of the war?
Hard question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me a nickname "crazy general with steel balls".
I'm not offended.
And it may even describe the essence of our work.
As head of the Ukrainian Officer's Corps, I've acquired some authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat, and I always keep my word.
Whatever's going on, I'm honest and I'm telling the truth.
Even when it's the Ukrainian government, or the Donetsk or Luhanian government, it's very unpleasant.
If they torture and kill people?
So I simply tell them that they torture and kill them.
And they're crimes.
I've often risked my life, even in the exchange of prisoners, and I've been captured... this job could be the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.cz: How many executions and tortures do you know about?
... (long murmuring)... Ukrainians and separatists resort to the torture of prisoners during the hearings.
I'm sorry.
And the executions?
They only take place on the Donetsk side.
I have no information on the fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
Not even any indication that the Ukrainian army is doing anything similar.
We have an idea about the amount of executions, but I can't state the numbers, and I don't want to.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
There are officers among them, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They're trying to be independent and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk - that's what they say.
They don't want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs anymore.
The Separatists are fed up with oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents - to life and to death.
As we say, they overeat them to the throat.
The same dreams and desires were shown in Majdan, by the way.
And now I'm going to speculate a little: Russia supports separatists and the West, on the contrary, the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large and the other to be small.
This is my sentence, but it's hiding an irreconcilable conflict.
A.cz: How do you, for example, feel one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of a war line, I'm without a weapon and I show bare hands to soldiers or armed men.
And they always have me on both sides of those two hundred or 300 meters in either direction or in an optical sight.
The faces of the people who are pointing at me, I always see well... and they can pull the trigger of their weapons at any time.
Paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - mother - lives in Ukraine.
They believe Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, only as a small governor in a large Russian empire.
In any case, they keep talking about it, and they consider Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding.
A state like this should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters - in a discussion show on Ukrainian TV, you described your Prime Minister Arseni Jaceňuk as a weak, helpless and tired "leader" who would do the best if he left quickly.
For those 300 meters, I always get at least five times the fear.
Why, then, should I hide the view that Jaceňuk is a very weak Prime Minister and is damaging our country?
A.cz: Do you think he has a share in the war in Ukraine?
Perhaps you know that the Ukrainians call Jaceňuk "the king".
And the rabbit is not an animal in the eyes of the Ukrainians, from which fear comes, or respect and authority in others.
His behavior directly copies the rabbit's behavior.
He may be a good economist, but as Prime Minister in war he has no right to cry in parliament, beg him, play with him his intrigues, threaten to lay down a function... he must direct the country, manage it, and protect it during the war.
At the risk of the country, the Prime Minister is not entitled to family, friends, rest for crying emotions.
He's the first of Ukraine's ministers.
And Jacenjuk?
She's acting like a teenage girl.
Yes, he's tired, but he's also weak because he's never strong... he's not fighting for Ukraine, he's just complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save their sales
The three Sylvester Stallones had returned less than $30 million from the US budget, and Sin City: the woman for whom I would murder would only return 12 million from the 70 million budget.
The sex tape with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million during the first weekend and also movies for children like how to train dragon 2 were disappointing for cinemas.
According to the article by the film critic Robbie Collin in Telegraph, children's films are responsible for their own quality.
Collin called 2014 "the worst" year of children's films and called how to train dragon 2 a mere "functional" continuation.
When it comes to films set on a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily have to be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, he compared the Entertainment Weekly servers CinemaScore and Metacritic and their average ratings of summer film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas between the Day of the War and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the views of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year's film harvest is of similar quality to last year's hits.
According to some commentators, there may be a change in audience access and a higher popularity of Internet servers such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, currently working on Disney's jungle book processing, told Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We have to admit it and not try to chase what's already been done.
In contrast to the current crisis of Hollywood cash marketers, Netflix's profits were achieved by Internet services of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studio for relying too much on comic book rights and predicted a "breakdown" to Hollywood.
In the light of the current downfall, some commentators say that there may be something on his catastrophic oracle.
In the film industry, other numbers are more optimistic, including the Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimoń and Juraskie.
The producer X-Men Simon Kinberg recently referred to the decline in sales as simply "cyclical". For Hollywood Reporter he said: "Next summer will be the biggest cash market in history and no one will worry about selling."
The DPRK is threatening Seoul again, launching another short-range missile
North Korea launched another short-range missile into the sea, announced Soul.
The alleged rocket test took place shortly after the completion of the common military maneuvers of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang perceives as a preparation for the invasion.
The province of Chagang is located in the northwest of KDLR at the border with China.
A spokesperson of the South Korean Ministry of Defence, according to DPA, stated that the missiles had been fired from a position in the northwest of the DPRK and had reached a distance of approximately 200 kilometres.
North Korea apparently launched a missile from the province of Chagang for the first time, and reported South Korean media with appeals to military circles.
They say there's an underground launch ramp for Scud rockets in the province.
This is another series of similar tests conducted by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea performed an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
During the weekend, protests took place between opposers of the NATO Summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the centre of Newport to take part in the march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to town hall in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the situation during the weekend and talked to protesters who arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be air-borne from Blue Mountains
DVA youth tourists were picked up by plane and transferred to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
Sixteen-year-old girl and 18-year-old male went on a hike to the Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday afternoon.
When they didn't come home, the concerned relatives called the police about eight o'clock in the evening.
A search squad was sent, including local police and rescue team, and a couple were found near Bridal Veil Falls around 11:00 p.m.
The girl hurt her knee, and the man fell and hit his head.
The cops stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stable state, they were transported by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, the win was on your leg
It was the 23-year-old forvard who could have made a decision, but failed in the two biggest chances.
After the goal was called mainly by a bullet close to three minutes before the end, a place in the network but ended up on the goaltender of Opava Josef Květoň.
I had it on my feet. I have to give it a chance.
I'm mad at myself," your little man put ashes on his head.
"I guess I should have put it up under my lid, I got a little high," he thought.
The defense of Sigma did not allow much of this Opava, except for Mikul's raid from 11 minutes, which however covered goalman Reichl.
Then the Hanans started pushing them, but they didn't let them in the block defending the household, and the missiles from afar caught the Flower.
We were comparing for 15 minutes, then we took the initiative.
In the second half, we were better, we had more of the game, and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But the missed chance of yours didn't change, and so it ended at 0-0," said Coach Hanak Leoš Kalvodu.
Opava also took the point due to the absences in the assembly, where in addition to a couple of wounded, Petr Vavřík and a three-goller shooter Petr Ševčík, who are visiting Sigma in Silesia.
She did not allow them to enter, unlike her past policies.
The replacements deserve discharge.
Sigma was more football, but we did not let her do anything except one standard," said the trainer of Slezanů Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression, and combat.
Remise is probably deserved, the point is a decent profit for us," he added.
Sigma got four points, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of the club Josef Lébra, who, after defeating Znomym, conditioned his million-dollar deposit in the cash register with diametrically different performances in the next games.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébra's warning, so there can be no talk that the boys would not want to fight," said Kalvod and added to the address of the sleeping shooter: "I believe it will come and when he score, it will start to fall.
But after the first shot, I'm going to replace him so he can save his goals for more games," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino's double excited Venice.
The film festival is otherwise experiencing a crisis
After a great enthusiasm over Birdman's opening film, whose director Alejandro González Iňarritu suddenly became one of the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the following days suggested that interest in the 71st edition of the festival in Venice fell somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critics recognized, but for the audience less attractive images as a document on genocide in Indonesia 60s Looking at the silence and other social films from the American 99 homes to Iranian Tales, empty seats simply remained in the cinemas.
Comic heroes
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet besieged the crowds as in the past, and it is reportedly no longer a problem to find a last-minute place in the hotel.
There is more talk of the crisis in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has also affected such esteemed institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but solely in relation to films.
While the younger fans wanted the autographs of comic book heroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who in 99 homes successfully played dramatic roles, for all generations no difference became the main event a visit to the legendary actor Al Pacin.
He lit up in two movies.
In the story of the Out-of-Cate Out-Cast Out-Cast, by Oscar Barry Levison, according to Philip Roth's novel, the 47-year-old Pacino has a role close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a strange owner of a hardware store from a rural town in Manglehorn, made by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for the best acting performance shouldn't miss it - but does the artist of Pacin's format still have the price needed?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and of the Italian one, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino proudly claims to the land from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italy
After all, the Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
After Birdman, the black souls directed by Francesco Munzi became the first shot to be rewarded with long applause.
The Calabrian mafia branch is viewed in it by the view of family relations between clans who fight for power and money, and the director managed to reconcile all the assumptions for a good movie: quality screenplay, camera, music and actors.
He was also interested in the chamber psychothriller The hungry heart that shot Saveio Costanzo with Albu Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost destroyed her own child with her misguided anxiety.
On the contrary, French competition films did not allow either the Redemption for glory or the 3rd of hearts, both of the works sticking to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, Birdman and Black Soul, are not so little at the first half of the festival.
And although the festival pictures have all the depressing themes, a new picture by Peter Bogdanovich, called She's Funny That Way, a funny comedy out of the competition in Venice and made in the style of American humorous 40s, managed to raise the mood for more than one day.
Policemen caught four producers of meth in Prague, drugs were carried from Poland
"The detectives arrested three men in the last few days at the age of 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who produced and sold meth in Prague from last November until this August 9," said police spokesperson Jana Rösslerová.
First, on Tuesday, August 12th, the Cihlarská Street intervention unit caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who was in the group as a buyer of drugs in Poland and a batch seller.
The following day, detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old, on the basis of the prior consent of a prosecutor.
The last of the four police officers landed in Wednesday morning hours on 20 August in the area of the Malaysian incinerator," the spokesperson described.
For drug shipments from Poland, the woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide range of activities.
In the workshop of the Letenské resort, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konevova street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced meth-making, provided various aids and chemicals needed for its production and arranged the transport of drugs with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He further weighed the drug, divided into plastic bags, and then sold meth.
He was helped by a 25 - year - old, unpunished woman carrying drugs from Poland or selling drugs.
She received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler said.
The CSI also conducted several home visits on the basis of the order of the judge, where they provided drugs, industrial chemicals, digital scales, paychecks, syringes, hoses and other devices, which, according to experts, can be considered as complete equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamines.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been a total of seven times convicted of property crime since 1995, the woman was not punished," the police spokesperson added.
In 2006, the last detainee was convicted conditionally for sexual abuse, and the 27-year-old engineer who was being prosecuted at large has been convicted nine times since 2009.
Even for him, it was mostly a property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotics and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they are threatened by a 10-year prison.
In three persons, the investigator submitted a complaint to the state's attorney and a motion to impose a bond, where the judge finally placed it," the spokesperson said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old repeater, ended up free.
His position and role in this case were not as important as the other defendants.
The police continue to work with this man.
Ferrari offers chess made of wood and carbon.
The Ferrari offers very interesting things in its other products at a lot of "interesting" prices.
A good example will be given in Italy by hand-made chess with a board of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, prepare more than 40 000 CZK.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer obtains a set of wooden black and red-painted figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibres.
No one can be surprised that players have a figure of an uproaring horse in place of a classic rider.
If chess does not appear to be a sufficiently valuable gift, there is also a need for a Ferrari 500 F2 made (of course by hand) in scale 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
Disturbing high school and high school doesn't make any sense.
In addition, the Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics show that gymnasts have a good application.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been great preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
Most of the time, it's routine stuff, like moving pots from summer storage to classrooms and braiding chalks.
They're going to have a little more frmol at the bitter gymnasium.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature for the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, a four-year high school in Hořice, after three years, opens up and renews its activities.
Not on a public but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that founders are so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering into the register of schools managed by the Ministry of Education.
"French socialists should shut up and put France right," says François Holland's key ally.
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to "show her support" to the combative socialist president, whose new division of functions was not met with the agreement of the majority of the French.
The President deserves general respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"Our duty is to stay by his side," he said, and he gathered applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial French thirty-five-hour working week, despite the passionate conjecture of Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Finance, who at the beginning of the week suggested that the rules be released.
On Saturday Hollande asked the socialists to remain "cohesive" to the government.
Christian Taubir, the Justice Minister, made a budget line for him when she appeared at a meeting of rebel socialist MPs, where the Socialist Party criticised for her "the French lost their faith in the future."
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extremely conservative right, has laughed at the constant internal disputes among the socialists when she said that she did not assume that the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls is also forced to build a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"The new will not last until the end of the autumn or winter," Le Pen said to her supporters.
She reiterated the call of her party to disband Parliament and stated that she was convinced that this party could win an early election and that she was ready to run the country.
The French ruling party suffered defeat in the March municipal elections and in May the extremely conservative right succeeded in the elections to the European Parliament.
According to a public opinion poll of Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of being divided into several competing factions before the end of Holland's term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would soon run out of patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that changes are taking place in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
The gambling and street art of Prague will no longer be limited to elections
Amendments to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved by the new management of the capital.
From the streets of Prague no more games rooms will disappear before municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
Even walking dogs will not be restricted.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees in October elections.
"In addition, the decision on changes should not be taken by the current city management, which ends in a few weeks' time," said Councilman Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several city halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to cancel gambling on their territory.
The game rooms will not disappear, the gambling order will not change yet.
It's a new town management task after the election.
We would not be able to make it technically, for example, due to the time limits for submitting comments and the like," Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current representative, which must amend the decree, would take place on 11 September.
On the day of municipal elections, Prague 1 and Prague 8.
There is currently a ban on gambling in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change even in the case of street art, the so-called busting.
Prague 1, which has already sent a proposal to the Magistrate to extend the current list of forbidden sites, complains about this.
Musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the area of Angel.
The decree regulating the walking of dogs the city is preparing for a few months, not yet completed.
The location of herens and the issue of busting solves city decrees.
They may only be issued or modified by the City Council.
The city halls only have an advisory vote, they can't issue the decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed the victory at the hands of the Scottish independence proponents
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it almost placed the question of whether the Scots want to be rich on billboards throughout Scotland.
But you don't get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet or getting their respect when you start threatening them.
Morals of the New Testament are still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
Scots have a much greater tendency to drive money exchangers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists Alex Salmond is well aware of this, and that is why he repeatedly asked his opponent, Unionist Darling, if he is willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if the Scottish voters vote for independence and start supporting the single currency for both Scotland and England.
It forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with Grimasa he fell into this trap.
Of course Darling won't support the Scottish voters' mandate.
However, the debate on the currency of Scotland has already been more or less neutralised.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and the defence of public health that citizens have for free.
Darling supported the London banker in the matter of currency, and he also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatisation of health.
Like Salmond said, "he went into bed with conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish policy.
Every Scottish voters know that Scottish entrepreneurs are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who spoke not to the voters in Scotland, but to the "boss" association, to the Confederation of the British industry.
It becomes clear that Cameron's refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Union campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absentee.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish Prime Minister.
Cameron could at least say that Scotland could be "a successful independent country".
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it's causing him almost physical pain.
The message is clear: Scots should not jump out and must accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.
The pessimistic beginning of the school according to Miloš Urban
Illustrations to a Tale The longest Year
Miloš Urban The longest year
The end of the summer was the best, the last week of the week, where we'd gone nowhere, and we'd just lay around and mess around with Grandma's summer, quiet before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes when you can get from Tuzex, the shoes from East Germany.
Reading Fast arrows, already taken, whipping on the bike through the mountain around Imperial to the back behind the Vary, somewhere near the tennis courts, there was no more heat, the sun stroked its back and shoulders, knocking the rays goodbye.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still a vacation mode, sleep till 7:30, in a week it's gonna get worse, the moments before they fall asleep stretch out from a few minutes to two hours, then wake up at 7:30 in the morning.
It'll be Monday.
Most of the time, it doesn't rain, on the contrary, the summer is lewd in front of the school.
To come up in a ghost light on a baton and feel like a plastic figure in a glass cap, there's that school, A.D.A.
Zapotocki with a monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more outcast, girls more busty.
There are thugs over there, avoiding them, it's still interesting how infallible they're holding together and how early they are.
And these adult-looking girls who came in screaming, they're laughing at something hysterically now, probably something changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything's the same with me.
And the new freshmen, some nervous and some other delights, why do they even come here?
Because they have to, educational military duty.
So inwards, the cool humidity of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolboy with the mop, unfortunately still the same one that he said would lend the student the key to the tin box, where you can leave the textbooks and there are still so few of them.
For a bottle.
The smell of the dressing room stays in mind, it's not happening now, it's aired, but it's gonna get worse in a week.
It's all about the idea of being stuck in the stomach, and it's starting to hurt.
A head that will even worsen the math teacher, the devilish game for the chosen, among which I do not belong and never will be.
Again, the threes and fours, not fives, hide from the trial, fit into the bench and best sublime, be there and not be, exist only as a name in the classroom, and dream stories about nicer girls and nicer buildings, antennas into space where no one competes, humiliates anyone, and doesn't undermine anyone.
The longest year is ten months.
And it's only the first day, now like years ago.
The daughters she was born had died.
She's in danger of a special punishment - Novinky.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in the public toilet at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, she was born a little girl who, after she cut her navel, wrapped it in a prepared blanket, hid under a jacket and took it to a road lifter, where she put it in the bushes located tens of meters from the road.
She was born on the way to school.
I guess it came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
I had a need to go to the bathroom on the bus. That's where I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut the umbilical cord with scissors I wore to school," the defendant described and said she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The following day, she returned to the place, put the baby's body in her backpack, took the body out of her backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag, and hid it and left it under the stairs in the house of her grandmother in Havlíčko's Broda," she is suing, saying, "It is not quite obvious when a newborn died.
It could be tens of minutes, but also hours after delivery, asphyxiation with blanket cover, or under the jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an unbound umbilical.
A similar scenario repeated next year in spring.
A woman, at an undetected time from February to April 12, when a corpse of a child was found by random witnesses under a bush at a pond in Havlíčkorod, she herself secretly gave birth.
This time in the bathroom of the attic apartment in the family house.
Without verifying whether the baby was born alive without cutting and tying up the cord around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic cases, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his partner took him to the pond.
Eventually, a friend turned her in.
The father of both children was just a friend of the defendant, but apparently he didn't know about the pregnancy of the partner.
For that reason, he is not in court now, he was only punished for a crime against the Law on Funeralism.
It was also him who later turned to the police.
I don't like that he's not punished as an accessory.
He manipulated a child against my wish.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it seemed human at the time," the defendant, who allegedly had been subject to a relationship and was afraid of him, did not hide the indignation of the defendant.
In the course of her statement, the young woman spoke fairly balancedly.
The tears in her eyes only the moment she talked about her relationship with the parents from whom she left after reaching her age.
She said she didn't want to kill
"They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don't deserve it," she cried.
I didn't get a kit because I didn't want kids. I felt young.
I still wanted to put him in a babybox, but I don't know what happened that I didn't.
I can't explain that to you," she answered the judge.
However, she refused to deal with the reasoning and intention of killing a newborn.
The second child, according to her statement, was born dead.
Even when she was pregnant, she didn't stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And he didn't drink hard.
I limited smoking," she said.
Although pregnancy was seen in both cases, she claimed that she was having health problems, even on repeated questions, that it was immersed.
And that, too, my friend.
The main presentation will continue in the Castle Court on Tuesday with the testimony of judicial experts.
A sentence could be passed on Wednesday.
A woman is threatened by a criminal rate of up to 18 years in prison, possibly by an exceptional punishment.
Norwegian Cruise is approaching a three-billion-dollar buy-back for Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the whole matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the third largest cruise operator in the world, in the negotiation of the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately three billion dollars.
The trade by Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion that competes with greater competition with Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), allowed access to luxury cruise ships Prestige Cruises and rich clientele.
The agreement may be published this week, revealed the source on Sunday, but he pointed out that negotiations still do not have to end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company called Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
Sources did not wish to be appointed because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the request for comment, spokesperson Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company's income in 2013 was $2.57 billion, 13% more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together owns eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
In 2013, the company announced sales of $1.2 billion, 6% more than in the previous year.
It is expected that the 29 billionth cruise segment will benefit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming year.
Companies compete for these customers to become the preferred option when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered the first public offer in January 2014.
Apollo has a majority share in the company since 2007 since the conclusion of the trade of $ 850 million.
Norwegian Cruise has been in its current form since 2000, when the cruise operator Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure and casino companies, controlled by the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise reported shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities at the end of June, Genting owned a capital ratio of 28 %, Apollo 20 % and a private investment company TPG Capital LP of 8 %.
According to the registration documentation, the first public offerings include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise totaling 82 % of the volume of North American passengers.
The pro-democratic activists in Hong Kong the day after the vote decision provokes the Chinese authorities
There was a group of people loyal to Beijing who waved the Chinese flag.
On Sunday, the Standing Commission of the National People's Congress approved the 2017 elections to be held in Hong Kong only two out of three candidates.
All candidates must first receive the support of the appointing committee, which is likely to be made up of members of faithful Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the electoral tickets and get pro-democratic activists to renew their promise and paralyze Hong Kong's financial centre's protests of the "Castle occupation" movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tension, and Chinese leaders fear that the demand for democratisation will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report on the Chinese official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city's business district.
The press conference, held by Prime Minister Li, is organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice-President of the Standing Committee on Legal Affairs of Zhang Ronghsun and Deputy Director of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also to speak at several press conferences.
The student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government's office this afternoon.
In the last days of the colonial government 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start negotiations with Eastern Ukraine on “state sovereignty”
According to a description of events by Russian newspapers, Russian President Vladimír Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop the fight against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately open negotiations on “state sovereignty” of the separated areas.
His spokesperson Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin had no intention of suggesting that the regions of Eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated so that the Russian speaking region would be given the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian insurgents as equal, corresponds to a clear strategy that follows from the outbreak of riots five months ago: Help the separatists occupy the territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly-announced New Russia effective independence so that instead of joining the West, it can connect with Russia.
In an interview for the first channel of state television Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern region of Donetsk and Luhansk, which the separatists took over in March and April after Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula belonging to Ukraine on 18 March.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently referred to the territory as "Novorus" or "New Russia", a term that refers to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian empire.
The Russian Press Agency Itar-Tass has published Putin's words that everyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians launched a campaign before the parliamentary elections on 26 October, while government forces attack civilians in separatists.
"In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must initiate meaningful negotiations without delay, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organisation of society and on the status of the State sovereignty of the South-East of Ukraine," he said.
Peskov said that Putin's injunction to state sovereignty was thought in the context of wider autonomy, which has been in the process of leading Kiev for several months and is intended to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking areas in jeopardy of cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov stated that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the Eastern region.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, it is an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The intervention of the Kremlin spokesperson, who was to correct Putin's "improper interpretation" remarks, highlighted Russia's approach to tackling the separatist rebellion in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two-million-dollar population are numbered ethnic Russians.
Moscow should also find it much more difficult to add Donetsk and Luhansk to the east of Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and the public opinion polls that took place before the conflict showed broad support for the survival in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations and thus, in principle, give the Kremlin effective control over the territory that would link Russian land to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is the headquarters of the main Russian Navy, the marine commercial base and the historical coastal resorts.
The areas between the Russian Rostov and Crimea are also a centre down, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inaugural speech of 7 June, proposed that Ukrainian legislators - after the new elections - consider changes in the constitution that would give the various regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs considerably from that of the Kremlin and the Separatists. Moscow is accused of armaments and incitement to violence.
Putin's last call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals followed by the next insurgents' advance last week after Russian troops and tanks entered Eastern Ukraine from a previously quiet area along the Azov Sea.
The separatists strengthened the Russians took control of Novoazovsk with such force that the Ukrainian security authorities fear that this is a campaign to occupy the strategic coastal territory up to Crimea.
This has succeeded in strengthening Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean peninsula.
On Saturday, Poroshenko spoke at the meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels and called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for the last 23 years.
“We are approaching a point from which there is no return,” warned Poroshenko.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks in the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit has taken no definitive action - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecific escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council on Saturday told reporters in Kiev that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovakia after two columns of Russian armored vehicles last week and 1,000 military units penetrated Donetsk region to support the sieged separatists.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovia during the Russian invasion were replaced on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured in the interior of Ukraine a week ago, said Lysenko on Sunday.
Also Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco are involved in a scandal with exposed photos.
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Greece and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photographs of naked Jennifer Lawrence got online in the biggest scandal with the celebrity photos hacked.
Hacker claims to have 60 photos of the naked star Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Because of the leak from iCloud, even personal images of Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourn actress Greece were reportedly released to the public.
There's 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greece last month, said the Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting. ”
All private correspondence and all private pictures should stay private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and disseminated to the public.
According to the newsletters, Greece, which is now in New York, has reported that hacking is “unscrupulous” and that those who have become its target “feel humiliated”.
It is believed that the hacker has taken 30 photos of Palmer with his former friend Scott Speedman, including two pictures on which the top without breaking through the pool.
Palmer performed for example in the film Love and Honor, where she was her counterpart Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the Chuck Strahovski TV series and actress of the thriller Sucker Punch Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen images.
Deputy Lawrence TMZ said, "It's a clear violation of privacy."
The actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker on his twitter: "Putting photos off hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods."
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The Sigma football players settled down, even without winning
Olomouc - Thunders and lightnings that co-owner of Olomouc's Sigma Josef Lébr sent down on his subordinates last week are, apparently, past.
Even though they brought only a point from Opava for a goalless tie.
After all, the club bosses made a little peace of mind by putting in and fighting.
Paychecks could be coming to the club soon.
"I'll keep one more game, as I said last week, but I'm much more optimistic," confirmed Lébra, that despite Sigma's failure to win, the players convinced him with improved performance.
The fighting and deployment we played with mostly in the second half was exactly what I want to see from the players.
In that case, I'm able to forgive him for not winning.
If we'd played since the beginning of the season, I'm convinced we haven't lost yet," he thinks.
Sigma stopped the introductory pressure of the domestics in Opava, then settled the game, and in the second half it was better.
After winning Kalvod, the trustees reached out, but they did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our ideas.
We lacked only one opportunity to be completely satisfied," said Lébre, who does not think that the change in the approach of football players caused only his threats.
There must have been more aspects.
Whether from my side, coach or fans," said Lébr.
Sigma must count on pressure
The players didn't want much comment after the Opava game last week.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to admit it," the young goaltender Michal Reichl twisted his head.
He left a question about Lébrov's statement last week, the attacker Václav Vašček, who did not turn the biggest opportunity for Sigma in the Saturday game.
After all, he talked a little bit about pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to pull on us.
Today we showed that if we fight and we all ride our asses, it will work," he said.
The warnings were taken to heart
Even Coach Leoš Kalvoda did not cover up that preparation for the game was not the easiest given the atmosphere last week in Olomouc.
It was pretty hard.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was obvious that Mr. Lébra's warnings were taken to heart.
Even though it wasn't about the fact that they didn't want to fight and blow it off," said the Olomouc coach.
It was similar to the first 15 minutes today.
It took us to deal with hardness and realize what the other league was about.
It's not just about football, it's about fighting," said Kalvoda.
There's nothing left to do but hope for Sigma to work from the start in the next game.
"I would love to believe it," he added.
