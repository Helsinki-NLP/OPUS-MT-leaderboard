You don't think so.
You said you'd help me.
You seem to be unwilling to do that.
You set up a trap.
You're about to celebrate!
You must come early in order for them to read your manuscript before your speech.
Well, at least you're saying to Tom and Mary that you don't need to do it anymore.
You should have been more prudent.
Έπρεπε να έχετε εγγράψει τα παιδιά σας πριν από μήνες.
That's what you're talking about.
Έπρεπε να είχες ακούσει την προειδοποίηση μου όταν είχες την ευκαιρία.
That's what you're talking about.

You're a lawyer.
Έπρεπε να ήσουν λίγο πιο ευγενικός.

- That's right.
You're right.
That's why I'm here.
That's what you're talking about.
You're right. You're gonna have to have eaten some cake.
You're the one who followed the advice of Tom.
I shouted as loud as I could.
You're more familiar than to put yourself in this situation!
That's right.
You should've listened to Tom more carefully.
Έπρεπε να έχεις κάνει καλύτερη χρήση του χρόνου σου.
That's right.
You're right.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
You should've refused to stay in Boston.
Έπρεπε να δεις την εμφάνιση του Tom's face όταν του είπα για το τι έκανε η Mary.
You should've stayed home today.
Έπρεπε να είχες μείνει εκεί που ήσουν.
That's what you're thinking.
That's what you're talking about.
Έπρεπε να το είχες πει στον Tom while you were here.
You had to have said to Tom how you felt.

You still plan to do it, don't you?
You think Tom could've done it by themselves, don't you?
You tricked me!
Έχεις μεγάλο κεφάλι.
You've got a leaf in your hair.
Do you want to split a taxi with me?
Δεν ξαφνιάστηκες που δεν χρειαζόταν να το κάνω αυτό, έτσι;
Σχεδίαζες να βγάλεις φωτογραφίες, έτσι δεν είναι;
You were skinny the first time I met you.
Ήσουν έκπληκτος που το έκανα αυτό, έτσι δεν είναι;
You will be allowed to go out soon.
You don't do such a thing.
You will know the truth one day.
You will need a video card to play this game.
You can never be as cool as I am.
You never will be smart.
You will pay for that.
You will stay here until you are summoned.
You're gonna suffer because of that.
You will work on the beach.
You'd love the movie.
