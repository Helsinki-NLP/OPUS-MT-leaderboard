Rome wasn't built in one day.
I like dancing.
It's gonna be okay.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're way faster than I am.
Tom lives in Australia now.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like juice?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's how it is.
We laugh so much.
Tell me what you'll get in the tests.
I think two languages are not enough.
Can you loan me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's a nurse.
I think we should talk to them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church with the car.
You're a lot smarter than I am.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at three o'clock.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to know French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The raw fish is not my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They're gone again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is she okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I know where you work?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who's that?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We found the green house.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I got a promotion recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please shut the door.
The garlic is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I was fainted.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
Everything that shines isn't gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
He's hitting my phone.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom's a taller head than I am.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Whose is that?
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train.
They killed our cows.
My name isn't Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Tomas lives in a cove of chives.
The water is warm.
You have to hide.
I already work.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone come?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom's gonna live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canadian?
People today pay more attention to popular culture than in the past.
Tom's no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they're coming back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you paint your hair?
Tom saw you?
We love each other.
I'm on my way every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
You shot him?
We may need some.
This is a proposal.
How did you spend the holidays?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
Have we got a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you mad?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who he is?
Did you see baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her phone.
I'm willing to die.
It's the same thing that it's either coming or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like people.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
You're 18?
I want to sport.
Tom was alive.
Toma's phone hit, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
Sort of.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myth?
It's up to 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain invited us.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her in love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
You wouldn't go to Australia to build shops?
How do you call that?
Laurie's still at school.
My office's downtown.
He's got two sisters.
You're not Canadian.
I attacked Boston many years ago.
Tom questioned Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letter is written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks frenchly.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the proof?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom's coming back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm unbiased.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom is your teacher.
The news gave him up.
We were enemies.
Who's got him?
We don't have anywhere to go.
How many blocks can you see?
This bus goes to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Are they big?
Tom's from Boston.
Tom drinks every day.
The cat's under the table.
We can't tell you.
He doesn't see any TV.
I'm the coach.
Tom's working this afternoon.
Who's that?
Dined.
He convinced the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the puzzles.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll watch you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom put the wall pink.
We're very busy.
Harder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe from your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fuck!", yell.
It worked hard.
I don't come here too often.
I'm gay.
You're easy to believe.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
She was the last client.
You like white wine?
They were wrong.
I'm saying it again.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That won't happen again.
Russia is great.
The teacher is friendly.
You destroyed her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for a long time.
I'm Harvard's graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
You can do nothing.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I did what I was sleeping.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow has hardened visibility.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something.
There's a house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now it's your chance.
You can choose whatever book you want.
Where are your dresses?
Tom's not a Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
You thought I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I haven't answered my letter.
Can I borrow your pistol?
Are they all ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I read him.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom's Turkish.
Can you remove from ten the six?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
He's smart.
When do you leave for vacation?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.
He likes to play football.
How old were you when you left Australia?
No salt left.
Tom gave us some apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
I know.
I broke into tears.
He talks like a truck driver.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he doesn't tell the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could have imagined it.
It's gonna be hard.
I want to be an actor.
When I was sick, Tom came and set me dinner.
I would like to speak with all the European languages.
Seven is considered a lucky number.
Where are your dresses?
I can't say for sure what's going to happen.
Tom paid.
I'm not tired at all.
They're red.
He said something.
Ever since I got married, I don't work anymore.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a skirt?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
And I'm kind of tired.
Are you sure you don't imagine things?
Don't apologize.
He walks slowly.
Come with us.
Nobody wants to take responsibility.
His father is Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time do they start?
I'm cut right now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.
I like to play piano.
They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell them you're not ready.
I have to read.
I want you to stay.
What are you reading?
We're not happy.
She's as smart as he is.
Where do you feed them?
Tell her to leave.
There's only three of them.
I have more money than him.
He's got Ukrainian citizenship.
The name of this song is "Only You".
There's an apple on the table.
Thomas can think that Mary doesn't like you.
Tom was here a minute ago.
Bin lived in Singapure.
I saw Tom.
Tom sold Mary his car.
I want you to come.
I need his name.
Can I stay in the car?
I have friends in Boston.
I don't speak Spanish.
Tell him to come home.
I'm not holding up to see the rest of the day.
Tom usually pays for everything in cash.
You won't enjoy it.
Where's Tom sleeping?
He doesn't smoke.
Tell me the good news first.
You thought I was Canadian?
Tell them I'm ready.
I need pen and paper.
Open your eyes.
We'll see.
Tom must stay.
I need to learn many foreign languages.
How about a drink?
And the Greeks eat fish.
They were co-operating.
No one encouraged him.
He dreamed he was kissing him.
What's the title of your new book?
We have each other.
He made the same mistake twice.
Tom heard Mary crying.
I saw him come out.
Tom will never let that happen.
You see me?
Tom bought a dog.
I like to eat pineapples.
He wants to go to America.
Tom has two brothers, one lives in Boston and the other in Chicago.
I really love you.
How about a drink?
I don't like spiders.
My name is Sarah.
I can't drink tea without sugar.
Welcome to the team.
Please repeat what I say.
The library's on the left.
Are you awake?
Where do you speak French?
You know you're getting old when you need to explain to a Greek who Melina Mercury was.
Who cares?
Tell me what you want.
First God
I know your older brother quite well.
He'll be back in a few days.
I lied to you.
Who's missing?
Is he Japanese?
Tell Tom I went fishing.
Okay, try again.
Tom and Mary need help.
The kids look scared.
Tom took his hat off.
I want to see the streets.
Which one is mine?
Algeria is relatively safe now.
Tom will help me.
You're very rich.
We didn't have tea.
All visitors are gone.
Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come on out.
I wish I'd been born a Canadian.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't take part in the debate.
Note: In English and weφαλify the nationalities, the days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Cyril. Nice to meet you.
He's got nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's sleeping.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sami was peeing and puking in Lylas's toilet.
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a pilot.
Do you have any sugar?
I went home.
Language is a living organism.
Can you help Tom?
Listen, I need to see you.
Tom was driving his girlfriend's car.
We laughed.
Take me with you.
I have to go to bed.
They're both alive.
They'll fix him.
Tom flew from Boston to Chicago.
Help me get her up.
This country is very poor.
Could we talk in private?
Is your car black?
Tom's gonna be there to meet you.
You made the same mistake again.
Kate doesn't celebrate her birthday almost ever.
How much do you want to pay?
Aren't you happy?
Forgive Tom.
Tom's a little smaller than your daughter.
It's exactly what you need now.
I did some research.
Do you feel tired?
"It's still shallow, huh? My feet are still touching the bottom." "It's quite a shallow beach, Jotsuba, you're still on the bottom, right?"
I left to London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid you don't lose your money?
It's cold, why don't you wear a sweater?
You ruined me.
Would you like to see them?
The birds are red.
Get me a glass.
I need more money.
All of them speak French.
Whenever I hear this song, Tom's coming to mind.
We had circles for an hour trying to find the hotel.
I'm not illiterate.
I'm eating.
Your friend is here.
I'm over 30.
Do not put sugar in the coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.
If you're wrong, admit it, if you're right, don't talk.
They're lucky.
It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where have you been yesterday?
Tom's John's brother.
Are you sure Tom can do that?
He's got a lot of money.
You better be honest with me, but I'll tell our mother.
The girls were looking at each other.
Brazil is the largest country in South America.
I like running.
Sammy says that about your own security.
I never eat meat.
The diarrhea does not have to correspond to a natural quantity. Anything can be a diarrhea space as long as the addition between diffusions and multiplication with a graded size has been defined.
His money's in the bank.
I'm so shy.
I love my country.
We're in a serious conversation.
They're here.
I think he likes Tom.
Will you visit me?
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to."
You were guilty.
I'd like to see the feast.
As Tom knocked on the phone, he woke up.
Tom can't help Mary today.
Mary wore her best dress.
Tom's unreasonable.
Tom can speak both French and English.
Tom predicted Mary would do that.
I can't leave.
I'm agnostic.
He wants to know how to cook.
I'll start with a tomato soup...
I need you.
Are you okay?
This book belongs to Paolo.
It doesn't seem like Tom's a Canadian.
I don't understand French at all.
They'll repair him.
It's smaller than your sister.
Give me the pepper, please.
My cousin is a journalist.
This animal is mine.
I wish I'd been born, Canadian.
I'll be ready on Monday.
Nine in the square equals eighteen.
Can I try it?
You're way faster than I am.
You're way smarter than me.
Tom has a brother.
Who shot them?
He writes me less and less these days.
Stick it.
Too bad you couldn't come.
Write something.
It took me three hours to drive from Boston here.
Tom pushed his nose into the window.
You're smaller than me.
She's eating.
I need your car.
Tom thinks Mary killed John.
I'll find them.
I'm here at 2:30.
You might be right.
Oxygen is necessary for burning.
Everything okay?
You're unbelievable.
Tell her I'm innocent.
My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
Okay, thanks.
I'm the only one who can save you.
Where's a bakery?
Tom owed Mary money.
Tom's not driving fast.
His current attitude confirms what we have guessed.
Tom told me he'd like to repair Boston.
Where's the cook?
The experiment failed.
Harder.
Don't be so hard on your son.
Her question is very difficult to answer.
Tom saw her.
It wasn't Tom who killed Mary.
You're alive.
You convinced me.
This is my daughter.
I was talking to Tom.
She must be sick.
I'm shy.
We'll have a visit to our friends.
I'm going through frequency.
And speaking of genocide, today is Columbus Day.
Sammy hired another maid.
I want some orange juice.
The entrance to the bathroom is very dirty.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to go now?
Would you like coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our trouble.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget this night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not going to reveal her secrets.
Mary's answering the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I'm at least getting drunk once a month.
I want some cheese.
He shot her.
I can't seek this word in the dictionary, I don't know the Arab alphabet.
Answer the question.
The problem is you're not Canadians.
I'll be in the car.
What's the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I lost the last two lessons.
I'd like to give me an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page ten.
This elevator is off mode.
There were so many people in the room that I could barely move.
He'll visit his uncle.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?
Tom has blue eyes.
How many tickets did you get?
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have wine.
We're here first.
I'm smarter than him.
I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.
I ate something.
Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is very small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
Everyone started running.
When does Tom read?
We'll kill you.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I would like a dog."
You work hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a good theory, the only disadvantage I think it's probably common to all philosophical theories.
Why don't I stay surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm so mad now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's too much trouble here.
Who saw you?
She's older than her.
Please repeat what I say.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of the three.
You asked them to wait?
He's crying.
It'll work.
I guess you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.
Is Tom gonna die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
Many questions remain unanswered.
I like Irish music.
Give me a spoon.
What's your height?
I wanted to be in Paris.
French is a difficult language.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
I should have some tea.
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Mary has very long hair.
I'm exhausted.
I know what she's saying.
Thanks for coming, guys, I'll see you in next lesson!
This is Tom's dog.
I know he's hiding something.
Tom kicked his head.
I accidentally met her at the store.
Tom's trying to learn French.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Don't you remember them?
I'm on my way.
Tell them I'll do it.
Do you have the source code?
Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want soup.
What?
Where did you find the key?
Could that not be right?
Tom can't stand the hot and wet summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, call me tonight.
I'll help any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
He's Italian, isn't he?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
He teaches us French.
You're so beautiful you don't need some music.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as they could take his feet.
I like fishing.
I don't like these candy.
The back door was broken.
I feel younger again.
Tom ate an orange.
You're the expert.
Tell him I'm ready.
I have a doctor's appointment.
Yes, sir.
It's true!
Can I use your phone?
It's from Greece.
Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of mushrooms.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was so hungry.
When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I did what I was sleeping about.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was impressive.
Mary is sceptical with strangers.
We're gonna shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I came home.
Life is difficult.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
I live here.
I hope you'll call back.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk slower.
Put the book on the others.
The bird's in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married Canadian.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Can you send them a message?
Can I borrow a pencil?
We only have three choices.
The Moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.
Tom snoops.
Don't turn out the light.
He was very happy.
Tomas obviously failed.
Aren't you a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom insisted.
Thank you, you look fantastic!
Will Israel attack Iran?
I like to laugh.
I washed my shirt.
We'll talk later.
Eating more late will help you feel more grass.
I'm a Frenchman.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
I got up early.
Tom's helping Mary.
He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father is rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll make a decision.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
French isn't hard.
Someone's shouting.
We found her.
Where are you swimming?
His hair was brown.
He's all repeating the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven died.
We can't stop you.
What language did they speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
They're Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
How long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay real estate.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before night.
Are you drunk?
Try writing a lecture.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father's missing.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's never been to Okinawa before.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus ride isn't boring.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom stabbed Mary.
At first I couldn't understand it.
I'm speaking Esperado.
California is boring.
I'm happy!
All of them are Canadians.
You're not welcome.
She's a very beautiful girl.
He's helping him.
Nothing's missing.
He started singing.
This is a menu.
I wasn't drunk.
He wants you to kiss her.
Tom was here a minute ago.
I had a rough day.
His mother speaks Italian.
I'll give her a tip.
Where are the girls?
You won't be alone.
Tell her I don't want to go.
I saw her take it.
I like sports.
I have money.
I waited for you at 2:30.
I don't think it's good for you to go out with him.
I won't tell anyone about you.

I have two mother tongues.
I won't sue you.
What happened?
We heard the news you passed the tests.
There are happy people and unhappy people.
We're not the only Canadians here.
I'm looking for Tom.
What the hell was I thinking?
Tell them I'm here.
I assumed you were Canadian.
I thought you were Canadians.
Where's her family?
Tom runs every day?
Thank you for helping me!
I don't want them.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I want to thank everyone for their prayers.
Open fire!
We went to church every Sunday.
Tell her we'll be ready.
Can I accompany you to the exterior?
He's still studying.
I don't want it.
Tom ran.
She's not my wife.
I want to know what's in the box.
She's younger than your sister.
When does your holiday start?
Tom danced.
What did you tell them?
I've already talked to Tom about that.
The Vatican is the smallest state in the world.
I want a drink of water.
I'm not sick.
He was busy.
Get out of my office!
What would you advise me to do?
Tom doesn't hate you.
The computer you use is slow.
I left the door open.
Tell him not to come.
He ate the whole apple.
I'm not kidding.
I'm bored.
She's different.
I just moved in.
What did you expect Tom to buy?
You're smarter than her.
I want that TV.
She's tired.
In an hour, we'll be done.
I'd like to write a book about Cyprus.
Tom's setting the table, right?
Tell them your theory.
I could find my trouble if I did that.
Where's the Greek embassy?
I'm your teacher.
Tell her you're sick.
Where are your keys?
Tom died in 2013.
I write a letter to Maria.
Tom and Mary love each other.
I'm sure I'll find a way.
Why are you so sad?
The chairs will be here tomorrow.
Would you like some water?
Tell them.
As far as I know, Tom could be dead.
She's smart, isn't she?
Tom is always willing to help.
Thank you for coming, guys.
Tom and I are both Canadians.
We're students.
Does anyone know Japanese?
Tom's not smart.
He was born rich.
This is a flag.
Tom's agreed hesitationally.
I play violin.
Pack your things and get out of here.
You'd be surprised what you can learn in a week.
I don't know where you're going.
I want a green one.
We have to get out of here.
They told me to wait here.
Why are you so sad?
Tom had to walk for school when he was a kid.
They robbed me.
Only we can get them out of here.
I guess someone should like Tom.
He's always working a lot.
You destroyed him.
When did you get here?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I live in Milan.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Am I your friend?
I may admire other people, but I never tried to become someone other than myself.
I don't trust women.
I recommend you to read this book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next proposal.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
What's the most multi-readed book in the world?
In the boil, the iron sticks.
This book is yours?
You're a lot smarter than me.
Tom's about the same age as you.
That's the target.
My grandson cries very hard.
Can you take over here?
We need more coffee.
I'm fine, thanks.
I'll be ready.
What are you gonna drink?
What color is your dress?
Nobody's gonna know.
He decided to cut the cigarette.
We're closing at 2:30.
I never hit Tom.
Looks like he lied.
You won't like what I'm going to say.
When are you leaving?
What time does the store open?
I don't know French.
You destroyed him.
From your mouth and to God's ear!
You shot her.
You like them.
Water is not drinking.
Is she eating the apple?
You better stay here.

We're all trying to help you.
The girl's beautiful.
I'll come with you.
Where's the money, Tom?
Where are you working?
They're actors.
Can you speak my tongue?
You're not going to Australia to build shops?
I like your shirt.
Tell them I'm ready.
I'm in bed.
Australia is a beautiful country.
Of course every religion has its own rules.
I know where Tom was born.
Go straight until you see the post office and then turn right.
You don't have to speak that hard.
Tom's eating a lot.
There were so many people in the room that I could barely move.
He'll be on his way.
You're ready.
We ID'd it.
It's a diet.
You're sick.
Tom's obedient.
I underestimated him.
Are you really Canadian?
Suddenly I started getting weight.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
This is Ali's book.
It was my husband's idea.
Tom wanted Mary.
I've got ten pens.
I appreciate that.
Have you paid all the bills?
Did you buy flowers?
Tom's approaching.
You told her.
Don't push the dog's tail.
Tom's mad at us.
I bought you red roses.
Tom made Mary cry.
He won a phone.
You look tired.
Not a lot of people like Tom.
You're stronger than me.
Tom's still in Australia.
I heard you.
Ask me tomorrow.
Tom tells me he doesn't care if you like him or not.
Pardoning others is an act of kindness to yourself.
My goal is to learn your tongue.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
I thought you were Canadian.
It was a bad choice.
Take my handkerchief.
I woke up and saw that my briefcase was missing.
What have you eaten?
I think I can hear them.
My neighbor's name is Tom.
I've attacked Tom a lot of times in Boston.
We have wine.

At first I couldn't understand it.
They like fruit to Tom.
That was my box.
He started singing.
He speaks French.

No one lives there.
Look at my arm.
Tell them not to be late.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
I'm proud of you.
The sea is green.
It's bigger than you.
Are you having fun?

Are you taller than Tom?
Yesterday I went to the park with Mary.
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.

Sorry, what time is it?
We have three kids.

This brings me great pleasure.
Tell them I won't do that.
I really like Boston.
I'd like to help you.
He's cutting me out.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Try to convince him to help us.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
You're late yesterday.

I hope it went well.

It's very glamorous.
Who brought you here?
We had our holidays in the lake.

I got you a present.
You're not poor.
We'll go visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job, but they promised promotion very soon.

You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll wash the dishes.
I like snow.

Who are you talking about?
Someone's singing.
How many spring rolls did you eat?
The flower is blue.

If you really want to know, all you need to do is ask.
Who is this girl?
Ignore them.
It's the hero.
I didn't eat it.
Our shop's not open.
You underestimated it.
Drop her out.
Tom stole Mary's computer.
Those candles aren't white.
The man they've been talking about has died a long time ago.

We all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is near the beach.
We're going to build a wall.
This tea is good.
This is the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You'll learn to speak English in vain!
Fantastic!

It's almost summer.
I guessed right.

I'll show you.
He wants to live in town.

We're doctors.
You think you could help me get the ferry out of the garden this afternoon?
Is Tom hungry?
I'm ready to go.
Who died?
Tom runs every day.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadians, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
Right.
We're honest.
I woke up at five o'clock.
Tell them we'll be ready.
Who taught you French?

How far is it from Brano?
Let's hope it works.
Tell them you're sick.

He's an asshole, isn't he?
What are you gonna eat today?
Tom's Canadian.
Did you kiss?
We've been warned.
Tom's got a lot of brains.
Wait here.
In his eyes, it was perfect.
Can you find him?
He's strong, brave and, above all, kind.
They're Canadians, aren't they?
I'll teach you French.

Tell him it's important.
Why exactly did you do that?
I'm eating.
Try to stay still.

I left the bank empty-handed.
Why don't you tell them?
Sleeping?
Where's school?
I'm not interested in politics.
Are you crazy?
I'm so tired.
What do you want me to do?
Do you understand them?

Wait a minute, please.
I can't forget her smile.
I'm going home today.
I have sunglasses.
We have the best food in town.

What fruit is red?

Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not very good at that.
I was hoping to see Tom.
Here we are all Canadians.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's gonna cook.
I was scared.
It's better to learn a guy how to fish than to give him a fish.
I was so angry.
I see.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will obey.
You were alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.

How many oranges did Tom eat?
"What do you want to know?" "Everything."
Tom insisted on helping Mary.
Tom will graduate in October.

Tom's too slow.
How often do you eat out?
I'm 19 years old.
When do you have a birthday?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a bunch of things to do.
I punished them.
Your friend's here.
I'm 30 years old.
How was the beach?
You're Tom's daughters, right?
Tom had a glass of wine.
I've told you things I've never told anyone else.
Put on gloves, Tom.
She's so weird.
I like China.
Tom smokes.

Do you like white wine?
It'll rain tomorrow.
I just said a big bullshit.
The house collapsed.
Put the book in the office.
Can I see your birth certificate?
Tom can't tell you anything.
We need him.
Eat meat?
I saw you on TV.
I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I understand you.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They all ran out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's futile.
Tell them it's important.
The party is Sunday.
Here we are all Canadians.
Here's how it stinks.
Tom sent you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How Does this word pronounce?
He saved me.
I got an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't get drunk.
I'm waiting for your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.
They trusted you.
You think this is a game?
I just finished the bathroom.
We're not going to change anything.
Look what I did!
Tom's a Harvard graduate.
You have thirty days.
Tom bought a little present in Mary.
The Russian language is a Slavic language, spoken as a mother in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is widely used, although without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which were the republics of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said you were coming.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm older than her.
Why don't you tell them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How old are you?" "I'm twenty-three years old."
Get some water.
I wish I'd been born Canadaza.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
We ID'd them.

My parents live a foreign life in the country.
He lost all his money at the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good show.
What are you gonna say to Tom?
Thomas bored me.
We're very busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your mandate the highest priority.
We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
My car is dirty.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.

Tom must be over thirty.
Help me get him up.
Tell them I'm ready.

Tom's cheeks got red.
I'm Richard.
What did you open him with?
Would he like a trip to Australia?
I think she's sick.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
Tom's gonna understand.
Where did he kiss you?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
Tom helped Mary.
I had my birthday yesterday.
Tom has a Canadian passport.
Tell them I'm here.
Tom's never asked me for money.
He helped me a lot.
Airplanes allow people to travel long distances quickly.
Don't you have anything better to do?
In my opinion, you're beautiful.
Let's all go home now.
With the rain stopped, the game came back.
Tom has my keys.
He looks happy.
We're well prepared.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like taking me to bed, right?
Is it raining?
He's very glamorous.
They'll hear us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
I consider him my friend.
What were you doing there?
It'll be the time you know.
I'll eat it.
Tell her to stop.
I told him.
We're from Boston.
Does Tom know French?
These cars are built in Japan.
Can I ask you something?
I work in a bank.
We'll stop you.
The global warming is in orbit to convert the peaks of the mountains into plain rocks to less than one icon.
"Did you do that Monday?" "No, I didn't."
Tom's smiling.
He loves Tom, not me.
I'm pretty strict with that.
Cars are necessary.
Tell him you can't do it.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I was lucky.
Pick whoever you want.
I live on Park Street.
Where's the exit?
My favorite color is blue.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
She speaks Russian.
Kids sleep.
You look disappointed.
Tom works for Mary's father.
You're much faster than I am.
Why don't you go play with her?
Is it blue?
Tell me that's not true.
He left without saying anything.
I advised you not to buy this house.
Tom's popular.
That's very expensive.
He was disappointed.
The dog is white.
When are you coming?
Mary is my wife.
Looks like someone's calling you.
How many tickets did you get?
I was never in Paris.
Tom has visited Australia three times.
It'll snow today.
I heard voices.
No, thanks, I don't drink beer.
Tom said it was unfair.
Do you believe in eternal life?
I'll fight.
Millie doesn't eat an apple.
I don't like wine.
You're smarter than her.
How much do you want?
Who knows the answers?
They killed Tom.
I rarely eat outside.
Sneak!
Please, hurry up.
You're drunk!
We've seen him.
They have potatoes in France but not in the Netherlands.
What can we do for Tom?
We think it's unfair.
You called them at the party?
You need to clean up your classroom.
Why are you laughing?
We've got a lot of schools.
Mary blackmails Tom.
He's not talking, he screams!
Are you from Australia?
They won.
What were you eating?
We're proud of Tom.
The horses are animals.
You're smarter than them.
Love what you're doing.
What football team do you support?
I'm up at 6:30.
I like rice.
Tom fed up his fists.
They at the restaurant.
I like that shirt.
Are you ready?
Good evening, what are you doing?
I'm not going to tell anyone you're in Boston.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Anything else?
Tom's single.
Are you going to Boston next week?
You look happy today.
I want you to stay.
We'll paint it.
That's easy to say, hard to do.
She showed me her room.
When will he come?
Australia is a nice country.
They'll fix it.
I don't care if you go or not.
It was weird.
Nobody understands him.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red pencil?
Everyone knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're older than her.
Let me make my position clearer.
I never understood that.
She washes her head.
You're smarter than him.
Time will show.
I won't be there.
We didn't know who he was.
Is your car black?
I'm sending them a message.
Tom left for Boston.
It's not fair to Tom.
Tom wrote three letters.
Tom's not your brother.
Where are you friends from?
I've had a lot of coffee.
He likes walking.
The man's young.
He's not a Algerian.
My car is faster than yours.
I don't live in Boston.
Tom likes all my friends.
What does she want?
Stop your crap.
Our university has a good library.
My horse is white.
Tom has returned from Australia.
I'll sit with you.
I'll call you tonight.
I'm from Kyoto.
He's jealous of his wife pathologically.
Can I have one of these?
Come over to me, please.
Was anyone in the car?
That's my baby.
Nobody moved.
French is not easy.
Tom came home tired.
Stop Tom.
They're older than her.
Did you hear her speak French?
I read a book last night.
He was accused of neoliberalism.
Tell us about your trip.
Tom says he's an emergency.
Tom had to accept things the way he was.
How old are you?
He likes to read newspapers.
We'll find them.
My father was Greek.
They were mine.
Are you shy?
You can't kill us all.
He didn't know what to say.
I wouldn't like to lie to her.
I saw Tom in the library.
Tom plans to stay in Boston until October.
To make my position clearer.
Is it important?
I assumed you were Canadians.
You bought a new house.
You never felt about me.
The thief was disguised to a policeman.
Can I get you out of the way?
I thought we could stay here all day.
Tom and Mary seem to be fighting all the time.
Tom gave me $30.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
He knew it from the beginning.
Everything went well.
The talk asked me a question.
Tell them to come see me.
You played.
I wonder which route is shorter.
There's a safe in Tom's office.
I want to go with Tom.
Who sent it?
I hope to see you soon.
Carol reads Spanish.
Everyone agreed with his idea.
Come quickly.
You have to stay.

That's hard.
I'll fight.
He's still here.
Nobody's sitting here.
Where were you last Monday?
She met him three years ago.
Tom translated the document from French into English.
It was empty.
‘Thanks.’
I have something to say.
Everyone's waiting for Tom.
Tom did this to you?
You need to help your friends.
I'm not gonna lie.
Who did you go to the dance with?
You don't make enough of it.
You're my best friend.
Tom's achievements are impressive.
Give me everything you got.
Keep talking.
Don't leave me alone here.
Tell them it's important.
You shot them.
I'll pray for Tom.
I'm too old for Mary.
Who found the phone?
He forgot to turn out the light.
Give me 30 minutes.
They look happy.
They work hard.
Tell her you can't do it.
You destroyed it.
You have some books.
We're ready to help.
About what did your teacher ask you?
Tom really loved Mary.
Is it yours?
I'll buy a new one.
Tom's afraid I'm going to be lost.
I'm so tired.
I want to learn guitar.
You like your car?
Announcing mayor.
Did you help Tom?
It's my turn now.
It's making my life torment.
Tom gave me that tie.
I wish I'd been born, Canadian.
I miss him.
Were you happy?
She's happy.
You guys are incredibly stupid.
I won't wait for you.
Is Tom sick?
What do you want?
We like kids.
He was wearing a black hat.
I closed my eyes.
Tell him you don't need her.
I like dancing.
You got the wrong key.
I thought Tom was a Canadian.
They were young.
He died quickly.
Are you angry?
What are you doing?
Tom's a mathematician.
You're Tom's friend?
How'd you lose it?
Each year the world population is increasing by an average of two percent.
Tom was the main suspect.
I thought you were Canadian.
I'd never think I'd meet you here.
I want you to sing.
Let me go!
Tom killed Mary.
You speak Hebrew?
Who sold his car to Tom?
You're so weird.
Come here right now.
French speaking.
We have to finish everything by Monday morning.
Yeah, sure.
Your husband is cheating on you.
Tom's obedient.
The dealers only look at the profits.
He married him for his money.
Many people in the world like spicy food.
Mary's playing piano.
I don't love Tom.
I have to go to sleep now.
I want to live in Brazil.
To do good to those who hate you.
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Tell her you lied.
English is not my mother tongue.
Will you give me your number, please?
Leave it there.
He may have his flaws, but I like it.
Don't believe it.
Who's your teacher?
I always hear music; I can't live without her.
It'll be hot today.
Kiss Tom.
Who?
Tom's very quiet.
He made me a cake.
Is your car fast?
I got up from seven in the morning.
What the hell did Tom mean by that?
He's a quiet man.
I ran to the bus stop so I wouldn't miss the last bus station.
Thomas told me Mary was in jail.
I'm fine, thanks for asking!
I saw Tom walking with Mary in the park last Monday.
They've sold the TV.
If you have anything to say, say it.
This house isn't too big.
Tom was busy.
I like to laugh.
I'm rich.
You want to marry me?
I like music and English.
He slept at ten last night.
You haven't even told me who you are.
I've got so many books about Tom.
I like this song.
You're a patient woman.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Give me another chance.
There's a pile of books on the table.
We should choose the right person for each position.
Think first!
Do you trust this man?
Who's gonna count the stars?
This is a game for four players.
Don't come near the dog.
Yes, I'm coming!
Tom's missing his wife and kids.
Where did you go on Sunday?
Keep both of your hands on the wheel.
He made me a cake.
Is Tom lying?
Where was he born?
That's unprecedented.
Nobody ever came to see me at the hospital.
You're not thirty.
Everything was perfect.
It's very fun to listen to music.
I think Tom's right.
Life is small, although the smile only lasts a second.
Now I know the truth.
My mother's here.
Beta's been here lately.
Did he admit it?
It seems to me, you don't often help other people.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
Next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you.
I know a lot of pilots.
We were fighting to survive.
We're not afraid.
You want that?
You're not yourself.
It was yours.
The house is too big for us and besides it is very expensive.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Australia is a fantastic country.
They're smiling.
"He kissed you?" "Yes." "I knew it!"
I'm on the deck.
I have more money than you.
Tell me about your son.
You still live on Park Street?
Unlock the door.
He's so young.
Tom and Mary live together but they're not legally married.
We went to a nice restaurant.
Tom doesn't hate you.
They trust him.
Are you part of a gym?
Where do you want to go?
There's books here.
I helped my father yesterday.
Nonsense!
I just did what Tom asked me to.
Tom told us not to be afraid.
I need to learn French.
Two beers, please.
Tom will survive.
Laurie lives in Melbourne.
Lock the door.
That's what moved me.
Let me make my position clearer.
They don't need money.
Mary's the type of Tom's wife.
That boy has black hair.
What do you know about Australia?
Nobody knows how it works.
You look tired.
We were both so hungry.
She died last week.
Tell them to stop worrying.
Everybody laughed.
She lost her money, her family, her friends.

I'll show you.
You're staying here tonight.
I told Tom not to use them.
I refuse to accept that.
We all know you.
Have some water.
I like cats in my dog.
Are you alive?
He's a good singer.
Tell him I'm sick.
Tom passed away in 2013 in Australia.
My love for you is hard to explain.
What's that?
Why did you stop?
Tom saved her from the fire.
Dinner's good.
I'll accompany you.
Save them.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
The roads are covered with snow.
How happy I am today!
I don't see you.
She let me see her daughter.
My house is near school.
I assumed you were Canadian.
You were busy.
It was easy for me to solve the problem.
I'd like you to stay with me.
Tom was married to Canadian.
I'll wait for you at 2:30 here.
The rejection hurts.
I hope that will continue.
I thought I heard Tom's voice.
What did you say to them?
Come with me to Boston.
Are you swimming a lot?
I felt bad about all these people watching me.
I'm doing what I have to do.
Peter loves Jane.
Tom blacked his hair.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I took it for a joke, and I didn't answer it.
Tell them I'm ready.
When did you buy her?
Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not a doctor.
When I was sick, Tom came and set me dinner.
My favorite color is orange.

Do you like your new job?
Good to see you again.
How am I supposed to find it?
She's the most beautiful woman.
A week ago, I had a tooth export.
You can take a taxi.
I rarely watch a documentary.
Tom told Mary to sit down.
I can read English, but I can't talk to them.

The Japanese are Asian.
What are they doing?
We're waiting for Tom.

My cat's white.
What time is it in London?
What else did you tell him?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
I can't remember Tom taking off any day.
Tell them I'm not here.
Tom's gonna change.
What are they gonna do?

It's a dead end.
Tell me what you want.
Did you like me?
I want to see you dance.

Where did you go?

Tom ignored Mary.
When did you buy him?
Tell him to leave.
We want to create the lowest possible upset.
We were born the same day.
You're undecided.
She promised me she was coming.
That wasn't necessary.
If you can read this, then you can speak a language.
Everyone agrees.
I survived.
Tell her to come here.
I always dreamed of going to Australia.
You can wait here.
I laughed so much.
When I first met her, she was close to 30.

We'll be back in 20 minutes.
I want you to go back to Boston.
Come quickly!
I've never been to Paris.
Put a prisoner down.
You're perfectly perfect.
Where's the money?
What's your dream?

That's unfair.
I'm speaking French.
Can I borrow your headphones?
I don't remember his little name.
We'll meet at the theater.

When did you get married?
Are you drunk?
You're an attractive woman.

They don't have what we want.
You're very handsome.

It played.
I know you.

Are you better now?
I'm not kidding.
Are you really Canadian?
Tell her you lied.
We're learning Chinese.

Tom walked.
Where are you working?
Nice suit.
Please, come before 2:30.
I'm a man.
You didn't help me.
Somebody needs to talk to Tom.
His real name is Tom.
We can't change the story, but we can learn from it.
He's not married.
Your English is perfect.
Tom has money.
Asshole!
It's not raining.
Tell them you're not ready.
What are you gonna order at the restaurant?
Let's wait for Tom.
That hat is too small for you.
This horse is white.
I'm inspiring.
I slept all day.
What town do you live in?
Didn't you read the story?
It weighs over 80 pounds.
My parents are in Australia.
My brother's guitar is new.
These will fix him.
Where are you going?
You'll have to memorize all these dates.
You invited him to the party?
You're unbelievable.
Save Tom.
He shares a room with his brother.
Aren't you happy?
He was alone.
Tell them I'm innocent.
I've seen this picture before.
She didn't let me read the letter.
I need time to prepare.
I live in Turkey.

You're stronger than him.
When are you coming?
Who am I talking to?
How much does this banana cost?
Tom will find you.
My dog's in an ass.
My name is Farsad.
I love Tom.
We were both tired.
Don't leave me alone.
Haven't you ever learned any of your mistakes?
That's not the target.
Don't talk about my girlfriend like that.
I didn't say he was easy.
It's raining today.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
Do you have the source code?
How horrible to think about what people say about us is true!
First class is easy.
Tomas's screwed up.
I think Tom's still in Boston.
Dogs look happy.
