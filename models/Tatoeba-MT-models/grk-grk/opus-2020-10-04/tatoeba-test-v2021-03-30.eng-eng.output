Tom said he understands why Mary's not gonna do it.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do it today.
Tom μου είπε ότι το παραπονέθηκε.
Tom's a member of my home co-op.
Tom drove down the street that Mary lives on, hoping to see it.
I'm sure it's not hard to do that.
You know as well as I do ότι δεν υπάρχει καμία πιθανότητα να το κάνει ο Tom.
Tom didn't know whether or not έπρεπε να φιλήσει Mary, so he didn't.
I know that Tom may need to do that myself.
Ο Tom δεν φαίνεται να κάνει αυτό που υποτίθεται ότι κάνει.
It's been tiring to do that.
Tom must've told us the truth.
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary would have done that.
There's something to do.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.

I don't think I've ever seen anyone do it before.
That's not difficult.
Φοβάμαι ότι δεν έχουμε αριστερά.

We have not yet succeeded.
I've never been to Paris.

I don't think Tom knows where Mary goes on 20th.
I know that Tom knows that you don't have to do that.
Why are you all staring at us?
I know that Tom didn't know who had done it to Mary.
It's because all of us in the family of them.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom μου είπε ότι νόμιζε ότι η Mary δεν ήξερε πώς να παίξει oboe.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank you.
Θα είχα φύγει νωρίς αν μπορούσα.
I know that I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom's not talking to Mary yet.
I don't think Tom is beautiful.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said that he thought that Mary was not asleep.
Δεν έπρεπε να σε αφήσω να πας σπίτι μόνη σου χθες βράδυ.
Νομίζω ότι θα έχω την ευκαιρία να το κάνω αυτό την επόμενη μέρα.

You't appreciate the poem until you have read it many times.
I deliberately did that.
Tom, never did you leave early.

Tom said that he's glad he was able to do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than $30.

Tom said that they like dancing with Mary.
I know that Tom don't know γιατί Mary's could't do it.

How many kilometers is it from here to the railway station?
I don't think that's true.
He often adopts the behaviours and speech patterns that characterise the advantaged.
Tom said you're a friend of mine.

Tom's είπε Mary he'd do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's through.
Tom said Mary's dog bitten.
Tom said that was through doing that.

Mary's got a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom said Mary thought that it might be allowed to do this today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like someone's smoking a cigar in here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think this question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?
I don't think anyone noticed what we're doing.
What is it to do?
Θα μπορούσα να είχα κλάψει.
There's no free lunch.

I don't think they've done anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
Haven't you got a TV?
Don't give up!
I don't play the mandolin as well as you.

Have you ever hit someone?
I don't think Tom was mad.

Tom and Mary, I'd like to know that they were healthy.
I think it's wrong.
There's a place for everything.

No one else was there.

I know that Tom didn't know who had done it for them.
Tom said that was good.
Γιατί δεν μου είπες ότι δεν ήθελες τη βοήθειά μου;
Tom said he didn't think we could do it today.
I just want you to consider the possibility that you are wrong.
I'm sure I don't say that.

I'm as happy as you can be.

I'm sure Tom don't force anyone to do this.

Tom don't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure that Tom will be there.
It is a great responsibility.

Tom thinks Mary's not awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?

What's wrong with me?
Are you afraid of anyone?
Tom thinks that he can do anything he's got to do.
We've been married seven years ago.

It's in a bad mood.
I don't think Tom was gonna cry.

I've just hard-boiled a egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary probably don't be able to buy everything they need for $300.

Tom could've asked me first.
Δεν υπονοείς ότι βγαίνω με άλλη κοπέλα, έτσι;
Δεν το έκανα αυτό μόλις έπρεπε.
I don't think Tom is bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.

A guy around there reminds me of someone that used to know.
Tell him I'll come.
They turned white.
I thought I'd heard something.
I've already said Tom I need to do that.
I plan to stay at home all day Monday.
I'd rather do it alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one's contradicted, Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is amused by what's going on?
We're not starting to fight yet.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do it.
We've been saying that's supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you're saying is shocked all of us.

I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is quicker in doing that than Mary.
Tom said that he thought that Mary might not be required to do it again.
You don't worry about the test, do you?
Tom said that he was willing to help me do that.
Σου είπα ότι δεν ξέρω αν ο Tom θα πει την αλήθεια ή όχι.

He said, "I don't work on Mondays."

You don't do such a thing.
You're so hot!

Do Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done it yet.
Tom said he felt like you did it.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as tall as a αδερφή μου.
Tom has read a lot of books about it.
I think Tom's already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?

Somebody's been telling Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who had stolen the money of Mary's.

I know that Tom could save himself a lot of time by doing it myself.
Tom said that he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I didn't say anything, and that made you angry.
When's the end of it?
You're a very naughty boy.
Tom plans to do so in the near future.
We're late.
Δεν είσαι ο μόνος που ξέρει τι συμβαίνει, έτσι;
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary είπαν to Tom that planned to do this.
Tom said that was a question of whether Mary could do it or not.
Who sends letters by mail; These days we have e-mail.
If something sounds too good to be true, then probably it is.
Tom said that he's hoping that you don't want to do it.
Tom said that ευχόταν να μην ήταν εκεί.
I thought you'd like to go with us.
I know you're not happy.

We may need to be in Australia for several weeks.
Δεν είχα σχεδιάσει να το κάνω αυτό, αλλά μπορώ αν πραγματικά θέλεις να το κάνω.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do this.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I swim every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
Παρίστανε ότι δεν με γνώριζαν.
I know that Tom is a bit shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if you don't stop them.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you will.
You know Tom and I δεν πρόκειται να το κάνουμε αυτό, don't you?
Tom and Mary μου είπαν that it ended doing it by 2:30.
Σίγουρα θα έπρεπε να γυρίσουμε αριστερά εκεί πίσω.

Ο Tom's really έχει πολλά στο πιάτο του αυτή τη στιγμή.
I knew that Tom knew who needed to do this.
I don't think you're driving.
Let us hope that changes today.
Δεν είναι καθόλου δίκαιο.
That is not exactly what I said.
We've put down the books.
I know that Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not possible with current technology.
He said he tried to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in the office speaks French.
I can't imagine if Tom has already told Mary not to do this.

Υποθέτω ότι θα πας κάπου μ' αυτό.

I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook a omelette?
Tom said that he knew I was coming.

We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know, I don't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I can't believe that we could do anything to help.
Tom said he'd been willing to help us do it.

There is a certain amount of truth in what you're saying.

I don't think Tom is a slob.
He's not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom was lying to me.
Tom is finally gonna need to do that.
Tom μου είπε he'd call at 2:30.
Tom' δεν έχει ακόμη πει Mary what you've got to do.
I know that Tom is a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
Ήξερα ότι έπρεπε να μείνω home.
I don't think that's enough food to feed all of us.
He's not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he planned to be a doctor.
Είμαι απογοητευμένος που οι φίλοι μου δεν είναι εδώ.
A wolf can't be tamed.

Tom didn't know what έπρεπε να είχε κάνει.
Tom said I'm studying harder.
We're saying that I'm gonna hurt you.

Φοβάμαι ότι δεν θα πληρωθείς.
Ανησυχείς μήπως συμβεί κάτι τέτοιο;
I know that Tom doesn't know that Mary did it.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see to it that it's done.
I wear a suit but wear no tie.
I'm as tired as you.
Tom thought you might be coming down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I'm sorry.
Είσαι τυχερός που δεν τραυματίστηκες.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.

Give me some water.

We'll need more time.

You're both welcome to come with us.
I don't think Tom's actually doing this.
Δεν μπορεί κανείς να κάνει κάτι.
Tom said he ate too much.
We're all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom't stop doing that anytime soon.
Have you ever told me about the first time I've met Tom?
I began studying French when I was 13.
Tom said he wanted he'd never played chess with Mary.
I know that Tom will probably give you permission to do so.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John may not have to do this by themselves.
I wonder if Tom is motivated.
Tom said that he would've done that if he'd thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know ότι έπρεπε να το κάνεις αυτό.
I think Tom's not the kind of thing I'd like to do if Mary did it.
I still εύχομαι να το κάνεις αυτό.
Mary, let me know that it's not about to stay too long.
I didn't know ότι θα ήσουν ζηλιάρης.
Tom didn't know that Mary had children.
We're saying that we can wait so long.
Εκπλήσσομαι που δεν ήξερες ότι ο Tom δεν ήθελε να το κάνει αυτό.
Tom may be lonely.
Tom said that I thought Mary was not very busy.
I'm absolutely sure it's not going to happen.
I think they're right.

I'd like to have Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, haven't you?
What's going on?
I don't think Tom knows whether you like Mary or not.
I lost in the forest.
I know that Tom is a good drummer, but I don't like them, so let's not ask them to join our band.
Tom μου είπε ότι θα είναι στο Boston next Monday.
Keep the στόμα shut!

Tom said he regretted what had happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't say Mary that he had to do it.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Have you got a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what he wants to do.
I'll wait till 2:30.
The parents of my parents do not allow me to do this.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it takes to do it.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why've you not eaten the food I μαγe?
I know that you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on the clothes of the father's.
I suspect Tom't tell Mary why he'd done it.
Tom said he's been trying to do it all week.
You have really beautiful teeth!
No one knew that Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everybody knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were just a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew ότι αυτό θα συνέβαινε.
Tom μου είπε ότι νόμιζε ότι μπορεί να το κάνει αυτό.
I admitted I did what Tom said I didn't do.
Did you know that Tom and Mary have three children?

Some people think that seven is a τυχερό number.
Tom called Mary to say to you that he thought it was going to be in Boston for another three weeks.
I'm learning Quechua.
It's Friday.
What's for dinner tonight?
Tom said Mary, I don't know if John can take care of myself.
I think Tom's out on the porch talking to Mary.
Είμαι περίπου the same age as you are.

We're changing our clothes.

That's not astonishing.
Ξέρω ότι ο Tom ξέρει ότι δεν πρέπει να το κάνει αυτό.
I thought Tom would know how to do it.

I think Tom's talking to Mary about that right now.
Tom said that he didn't think that Mary would have done that.
I knew that Tom was a better cook than me.
Tom knows I borrowed the money from Mary.

Stop criticizing me!
Tom says he didn't do it.
Σε ψάχνω.
Tom said that he knew that I was not going to cry.

I want to go and change into that shirt I bought yesterday.
Tom said that he thought Mary was lying.
We had to have stayed with you.
I don't think Tom is lonely.
This is not the first time I've ever done it.
If Tom't can't do it, probably κανένας άλλος δεν μπορεί.
I thought Tom might stop by this afternoon.
I think the economic impact will be minimal.
You're gonna have to let Tom know that Mary πρόκειται να το κάνει αυτό.
It's been a long time ago.

Νόμιζα ότι αυτό έπρεπε να κάνουμε.
I never did it to you.
Tom should've been quicker in doing that than Mary.

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We know that we can do better.

Θα ήμουν εκεί μέχρι τώρα αν το αυτοκίνητό μου δεν είχε σπάσει.
We're brothers.
I wrote a long letter to Tom.
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I don't think that giving Tom a knife was a good idea.
I thought you were gonna kill me.
I think there's a possibility that Tom will do that.
It is surprising that there is a second house in America.
I'm sorry.
My mother can't drive a car at all.
Υπάρχουν πολλά που συμβαίνουν αυτή τη στιγμή.
I wonder if Tom is rich.
It is not necessary for me to do that.
I don't think anyone noticed what they did to Tom.
I think you're bossy.
Tom backed their car up to check, but the raccoon he had run over was dead as a doornail.

Tom must've left their umbrella on the bus.
Μου είπαν ότι είναι σπασμένα.
No one but Tom did.
I don't think Tom will be surprised that it happened.
I guess you're not interested in going with us.
It's not easy to understand from everyone.
I'm hungry.

Αυτό είναι το καλύτερο πράγμα που έκανε κανείς για μένα.
Tom said Mary that he didn't think that John was glad that it was gonna happen.
Εάν δεν ήταν για την καταιγίδα, θα είχα φτάσει νωρίτερα.

Do you have any idea when Tom's planning on coming here?

I can't believe it's going to happen again.
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I didn't abide look at it.

I thought you were a doctor.

Ποτέ δεν πίστευα ότι θα πάω εκεί.
You know, it's not true.
I know Tom and Mary has left Australia.

Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.

Tom, I'd like to know that he thought that Mary was wrong.

Tom said he's looking forward to the retirement.
Whether we do it now or later, it doesn't matter.
Ας ελπίσουμε τα πράγματα να μείνουν έτσι.
Έπρεπε να είχα προβλέψει ότι ο Tom δεν θα τα πήγαινε καλά με τη Mary.
Νομίζω ότι είναι μάλλον απίθανο να μην ήξερε ο Tom ότι δεν θα του επιτρεπόταν να μπει στο μουσείο χωρίς τους γονείς του.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination of this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary's not planning on doing that until I tell you to.

I think Tom is thirty years old.
Think about it.
I'd like to say to Tom that you'd come to Australia.

I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I don't think anyone did it.

You're sure Mary said that planned to do it tomorrow?
There were times I would've lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom, I'm just saying that he thought Mary was crazy.
Tom already knows that Mary did it.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
Υπόσχομαι ότι δεν θα πω σε κανέναν πού είσαι.

However, every so often, the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms.

Which country you're from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I've made enough spaghetti for all.

This is an unusually difficult language.
He realized that it was necessary to do so.
I'm sure Tom needs to do that again.
Tom must've been tortured.
Last night I puked.
Everyone here, except for me, has done that.
Tom is almost as tall as Mary is.

I suppose you've been able to have proof of this already.
I don't think you're gonna have to do it till this afternoon.
Tom είπε ότι ήλπιζε ότι η Mary θα ήθελε το δώρο που σχεδίαζε να της δώσει.

Tom didn't read everything as carefully as you did.
We know that Tom is unlikely to do that.

That's just a long time ago.
I don't think it's very likely that Tom will come over this time of night.
I don't mince words.
Tom said that he thought that he'd have to do it tomorrow.

Tom don't want Mary to know that he don't know how to do it.

There's a good chance that Tom will ask Mary to the dance.
