Other Members are concerned that they will be confused with the mapets.
Some Members expressed their concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Parliament of Wales).
This concern has arisen in relation to the plans for changing the name of the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
Members in the entire political spectrum are concerned that this will sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party said that his version is concerned that "he will be familiar with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers from outside Wales: In Glasses, the word "twp" means "hizos" and the word "pwp" means "predicts".
One Platinum Member said that the order as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Hungarian conservative said his version was "open" about changing the name, but he noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "mapt".
In this context, the glass letter w pronounces similar to the English accent of Yorkshire of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Commission, which is currently drafting the bill on the adoption of the change of name, said: "The final decision on any name called the Members will naturally be the case of Members themselves".
The Law of the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Parliament of Wales the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of the initiative as a Parliament of Wales.
With regard to the title of Members, the Commission has been in favour of the name "Member of the Parliament of Wales" or WMP, but it is the MWP option that has received greater support in public consultation.
Members obviously propose alternatives, but the attempt to reach a consensus may be a difficult case for Parliament's President, Elin Jones, who is expected to table the name change bill within the next few weeks.
The reform law will also include other changes in the way in which the initiative operates, including rules on deprivation from the post of the Member and the planning of the committee system.
Members will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name when discussing legislation.
The citizens of Macedonia are invited to the polls on the referendum on the change of the country's name
voters will vote on Sunday on the country's name change to "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The people's vote was called for an attempt to resolve a conflict of decades with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that its northern neighbour's name hides territorial views and has repeatedly opposed his requests for EU and NATO membership.
Gorge Ivanov, President of Macedonia, a war of the referendum on the change of name, said he would not take account of the vote.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the change is simply the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St Martin's bells have been swept as the Harlem churches disappear
"The older people I talked to, they say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
Today, there's nothing of the two."
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"The world is socializing in a different way today," he said.
"The bars are no longer the "saloni" of the neighborhood where people tend regularly."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not hold as long as the responsible 'and sooner or later will return to the point where they started'.
The congregations added, can be replaced by multi-circuits filled with people who will not be willing to help the places of worship left in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, and therefore will speed up the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people move into these apartments become members of the churches."
Both congregations were built by white churchs before Harlem metropolis blacks - the Metropolitan community was built in 1870, the St Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist Church left in the 1930s.
A black church that was nearby took possession of the building.
The occupation of St Martin's building took over a church of blacks under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who went to boycotts of the 125th Street stores, a basic commercial road in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused serious disasters in the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners took over the reconstruction and ordered the chin.
Reverend David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor in St. Martin's church, called the charm "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the charm in July described it somewhat differently: "political treasure" and "unreplaced instrument of historical importance".
Specialist Tiffany Inn from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first charm in the world played by black music, Dionysios A. Led, who was transferred to a larger charm in the Church of Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwether said that St Martin's church didn't replace him.
What has been happening in St Martin in recent months is a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been hired by the popular leaders of the church, while others from the bishop.
Commissioners - the administrative body of the parish, composed of the popular leaders - sent a letter to the epic in July on their concerns that the episcop "will seek to transfer costs" to the board of Commissioners, despite the fact that this had no involvement in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the church.
Some parishors complained about the lack of transparency on the side of the attack.
Attack shark in 13-year-old diving for bourgeois in California
Shark attacked and injured 13-year-old boy on Saturday during divings for sanctuary fishing in California, on the first day of the age of the star, according to the principles.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon Beach beach in the city of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV to San Diego that he was diving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the voices of the child asking for help and approached with a team to get it out of the water.
Hamel said at first he thought they were just screaming excited because he caught a lobster, but then he realized he was calling "Something bit me!
Something bit me!"
His entire key was open," Hamel noticed when he arrived at the place where the boy was.
"I've called everyone out of the water, "There's a shark in the sea!" Hemel added.
The boy was cut off by air at the Randy Children's Hospital in San Diegeko and his condition is critical.
The kind of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Marine Larry Giles told the press release that the shark was located in the area a few weeks earlier, but was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was carrying serious injuries to the upper part of the torso.
The authorities forbided access to the beach from Ponto Bush to Kasampland to Suamis in Ensinita for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 types of shark in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans exert pressure on the UK cosmetic products market
The Sainsbury's is measured with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams putting cosmetic shelves similar to those of the stores, sent with special employees.
In the context of the major increase in UK cosmetic market of £8 billion, which continues to grow while sales of clothing and household items fall, the largest cosmetic shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and spread to more stores if the project succeeds.
The investment in the cosmetics sector comes as the supermarkets are looking for a way to make up for the space in the shelves that once received televisions, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury's said they would double the size of their cosmetic supply in 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series will also be given more space with shelves with the company's logo, similar to those of the stores like Boots.
Supermarket is reshaping its own makeup range Boutique so that most products are vegan - something that younger consumers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the perfume company The Fragrance Shop will try to dispose of its products in two Sainsbury's shops, the one that opened in Crointon, South London, last week and the other in Selli Ouk, Bermieham, later this year.
Electronic markets and the trend to buy small quantities of food daily in local minimarkets, means that supermarkets should make greater efforts to make people visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of the Sainsbury's, said the outlet stores would look more and more like shops, as supermarket chains are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl discount shops with more services outside food.
Sainsbury's placed outlet Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also imported some Habitat as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported sales of groceries and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt of supermarkets to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended up with failure.
Sainsbury's tried a consortium with Boots in the early 2000s, but co-operation ended after a dispute about how the profits from the pharmacy shops to the supermarkets of the chain.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the pharmaceutical company in Celesio, holder of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, compared to £25 million, three years ago.
He stated that Lloyds will play its own role in the project, adding an enlarged range of luxury treatment companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Chicks, commercial director of the Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the appearance and sense of our wrinkles to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in qualified staff who will be available to give advice.
Our range of companies is designed to meet all needs, while attractive environment and urban locations mean that we are now a strong destination for cosmetics that question the traditional way of buying."
Peter Jones: exiled after Holly Wyloby's departure from the 11 million-dollar deal
Dragons Den, Peter Jones, protagonist, is furious after the withdrawal of the telecomer Holly Wylobi from the 11 million-dollar deal with the lifestyle business it has, in order to assimilate to its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Wyloby doesn't have time for the clothing company and Truly accessories.
Their business was like Guinth Palmrow's Goop company.
The 37-year-old show presenter "This Day", told Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Williams made the lead in the Dragons Den series, Peter Jones, leaving their profitable lifestyle business at the last minute, in order to assimilate to its new huge symbols with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden TV girl admitted during a meeting full of tensions Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to its new symbols - £ 1.5 million - he would no longer have enough time to dispose to the company of clothing and accessories Truly.
The company was likened to Guineth Palmrow's Goop company and seems to have doubled Wyloby's property estimated to be £11 million.
Following the announcement of the 37-year-old Williams in Instagram that he is going to leave Truly, Jones flew out of Britain to some of his countryside homes.
According to some source: "The Truly was far from Holly William's top priorities.
It was for its long-term future, its source of revenue for the next decades.
Her decision to leave was astonished to all those involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There's a storage room full of products at the headquarters in Marlow's ready to be sold for sale."
Experts estimate that the withdrawal of the "This Day" shower, which is among Britain's most commercial celebrities, could cost millions to the company because of the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to household clothing and clothing items, as well as further delaying its presence.
And that can mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Wyloby, a mother of three children, and Dan Baldwin's husband has maintained close friendly relations with Jones and his wife Tara Kaps for ten years.
Wyloby founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and the 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couples spend their holidays together, and Jones keeps a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV company.
Wyloby is going to become the central person in the M&S bells and replace Adam McPartlin in the show of the "I'm A Celebrity" show on the ITV.
A source of Jones' close surroundings said last night "We wouldn't want to comment on his business affairs."
We were tough "and then we fell in love"
He was joking about the criticism he accepted from the media about a comment that some would think was not appropriate to a president, as well as to his so positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trab said imitating the style of a teleconspirator.
"I didn't give up anything."
He stated that Kim was interested in a second meeting, since the initial meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trab as a big step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearisation have been delayed.
Over three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's leading diplomat Rii Yong-Ho told world leaders in the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see any "responsibility" from the United States after the early disarmament of North Korea.
Instead, he stressed, the United States continues to apply sanctions which aim to exert pressure.
Trab held a much more optimistic attitude in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
"We almost fought with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
We have now built this excellent relationship."
He stated that his efforts to improve his relations with Kim gave positive fruits - ending missile tests, delivering hostages and returning the rest of American soldiers to their homes.
While he supported his unusual attitude in statements about his relations with Kim.
"It's so easy for you to have a "pristian" style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn't get in here, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, showing the crowd ahead of him.
Tsunami and Indonesian earthquake scan an entire island, leaving thousands of dead on their path
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, it was announced that foreign non-governmental organisations will not be required to assist.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lobok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a necessary condition for the recovery of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they do not seek international assistance, so it is quite difficult," said Mrs Subung.
While the Save the Children organisation is preparing a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a representative of the national natural disaster service, said that the Indonesian authorities evaluated the situation in Palau to see whether it would allow international organisations to help.
Given the seismic vibrations often affected by Indonesia, the country remains well unpredictable against nature's wrath.
While they have been built for tsunami in Ace, it is not the same as in other coastlines.
The obvious lack of an alarm sirens for tsunami in the Palau, even after warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so much life.
In the best case, the movement between the numerous islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are even more complicated by administrative care.
A floating hospital that had parked in Lobok for the care of the victims of the earthquake is heading to the Palace, but it will take at least three days to reach the location of the new disaster.
President Joko Uidondo was at the centre of his campaign's election to improve Indonesia's degraded infrastructure and provided simple-time money for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding magnifies Mr Joko's administration, before the reelection next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from the persistent fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as groups of Christians and Muslims fight on the streets, using fighters, bows and arrows, as well as other armies.
Watch: Daniel Stiritz of Liverpool is equal to Chelsea
Daniel Strange saved Liverpool from a defeat at the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Strange accepted Serdan Shakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's end with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball on his left and smack in the back beam.
His effort was very high from the large area and ended up up right on the nets.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arizobaga who jumped to cut her off and entered the nets.
"I was trying to get this position, get to the ball and players like Shakiri always play as far as possible forward, so I tried to win as much time as possible," said Stiritz at LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Cante approaching, I was switching directly, I didn't think so much, and I did the suit."
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead in the half-time after the goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Azar.
The blue aggression gave Mateo Kovatsic every time in this game before giving a shot with a fog near the center of the field and running on the side of Liverpool.
Kovatsic did one of the two in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azar to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defense and completed by sending the ball to the nets in the back beam with left suite in front of Allison Becker, Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight Naples at the Champions League teams stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will deal with Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The tragic deaths of tsunami in Indonesia amount to 832
The post- earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia accounts for 832, according to the country's natural disaster service declarations, early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the wreckage of the buildings that collapsed after the earthquake of 7,5 degrees that hit the area on Friday and created waves of 6 meters high, said the representative of the service, Sutopo Poirot Novrocroho in a press conference.
The city of Paros, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the ruins of the buildings they collapsed.
Police arrested 32-year-old, suspicious, after a man's murder with a knife.
A murder investigation started after a woman's body was discovered in Birkenhead this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Miουζ in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the travelers who saw or heard something to testify to the police.
Officer Brain Ohaygan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to anyone in the neighboring area around John Street and he saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have in possession the information that is vital to our investigation."
A police representative confirmed that the woman whose body was found is resident of Birkenhead and found in a building.
This afternoon friends who think they may know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about the location where it was found this morning.
Research is under way as the police said it is in the process of informing the nearest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson My House, in his attempt to return to his apartment was informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He stayed phony when he found out what happened.
The tenants were informed that they might have to spend hours before they were allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer allegedly told a man that the whole area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared with tears on the scene.
He kept repeating it's horrible.
At 2 p.m., two vans of the police were located through the police ribbon and one off.
Cops stood outside the ribbon and watched the building.
Anyone who has any information is being invited to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to anonymise with Crimestoppers line at 0800 555 111 on the 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument hit by the philosopher's "delete of history"
His ostracism would be a criminal justice for the tragic destruction of many cultural and religious works in England by his fanatical puritan supporters.
However, Collogue Cromwell described Mr. Crick's proposal as "annoy" and "pathy to re-enact the story".
John Goldsmith, president of the Association of Cromwell, said: "In this debate on removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's form would not be targeted outside Westminster's Palace.
The iconography of the civil wars of England was not dictated or executed by Cromwell.
Possibly, the wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for Thomas' ancestor's actions in the previous century.
The excellent representation of Cromwell by Sir William Hammo Thornikovt is characteristic of his image in the 19th century and part of the history of a person who many think is worth a tribute.
Mr. Goldsmith stated in The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course the monarchy.
The question of whether this is an entirely precise case is the subject of an open historical debate.
The only thing that is certain is that the conflicts in the middle of the 17th century have shaped the subsequent development of our nation and Cromwell is an identifiable personality that represents one side of the division.
His achievements as Lord Prestat are also commendable and memorable."
Pigs-doloof hurts lethal Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in Southwest China, according to local news sheets.
The man whose only surname was announced "Uan", was found with cut-off artery in a blood lake near a sanctuary on the market in Ljupansuai in Guitshaw province, in South China, the Morning Post announced Sunday.
Suitable in a pig room is about to make pig vaccines on 30 May 2005 in Zining in Kinhai Province, China.
He allegedly traveled along with his cousin from the neighboring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a neighboring porkhouse.
He stated that in the pig room there was a big male pig with blood in his mouth.
The coroner’s examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had injured the farmer deadly, according to his report.
"My cousin's feet were bloody and cold," said the cousin, known by the name of "Gu", according to the evening news report of Guigang.
The security camera footage show Wan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man doesn't belong to Won nor to his cousin.
A market operator told the evening news statement that the pig has been placed in a cage to not attack anyone else, while the police collected the evidence at the scene of the attack.
Uan's family and market authorities are alleged to negotiate compensation for his death.
Even though rare cases of attacks on pigs have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, seriously hurting the man.
Ten years ago, a pig of 295 kilos threw a farmer in Wales on his tract until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal to get away.
After the incident in which a farmer from Oregon was destroyed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but the blood taste can act as a "single".
"It's just a playful mood.
They're young, very strange creatures... they don't want to hurt.
We should just show them the right respect," he said.
The remains of hurricane Rosa are about to bring extensive rainfalls to the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves above cold water masses of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the hurricane Rosa will bring catastrophic rainfalls in North Mexico and Southwest USA over the next few days.
The winds of hurricane Rosa reached 85 mph, consisting of hurricane Category 1, at 5 a.m. east, on Sunday and 385 miles southwest of Puda Eukenia, Mexico.
The hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low-pressure area of winds has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and move east to the West coast of the United States. As the hurricane Rosa is approaching the South California peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will bring tropical humidity to the north in the Southwest USA.
The hurricane Rosa will bring rainfalls of 25 centimeters in Mexico's areas on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity combined with the area of low wind pressure approaching will create extensive rainfalls in Southwest in the next few days.
Locally, rains of 2,5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous floods, flood flows and potentially landslides in the desert.
The deep tropical humidity will lead to rain rates close to 5 to 7.5 cm per hour by site, especially in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
A total of 5 to 10 centimeters is expected in the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona.
Floods are likely with rapid deterioration in the phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfalls.
It is recommended that you avoid any walking movement in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rain.
Powerful rainfalls can convert the goats into orchard rivers and storms will cause local steep winds and sanding.
The low wind pressure area will create some locally powerful rainfalls on site in the South California coastline.
A total level of rainfall over 1 cm is possible, which can cause small flows of floods and slippers on the roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropical boots will start approaching Arizona late Sunday and early hours on Monday, before the phenomena expand late on Monday and Tuesday.
The powerful rainfalls will spread to the Foror Corners area on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October there will be some intense temperature changes in the whole of the United States as the temperatures in the Arctic fall, but in tropical areas remain quite high.
Sometimes this leads to very intense temperature changes at nearby distances.
A characteristic example of the intense temperature differences between the central US was observed on Sunday.
There was a difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omah, Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moine, in Iowa.
In the next days, persistent high summer temperatures will be noticed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern States, October is expected to start with high temperatures of 27 °C from the East to parts in the Southeast.
The temperature in New York may reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for the weather, there are several chances of being seen above the average in the eastern US by the first half of October.
More than 20 million television viewers attended Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million television viewers attended the sedative testimony of the candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, on Thursday and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which was allegedly happening in the 1980s, Christine Bleizi Ford, in six television networks.
In the meantime, the political deadlock continued, with the television networks interrupting the normal flow of the program to overthrow the last minute on Friday: the agreement by the senator of Arizona Jeff Fleik on an FBI survey of the charges.
Fort told the Senate Justice Committee that she's 100 percent sure how at a party while Kavano was high school students attacked while he was drunk and attempted to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh, in a loaded statement, said he was 100 percent sure that something like that didn't happen.
According to Nielsen's measurements, they are likely to attend the hearing on Friday more than 20.4 million television viewers.
The company calculated the average television on the CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC networks.
The numbers were not immediately made available for other networks that transmitted the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
As well as Nielsen is usually difficult to calculate the number of television viewers attending a service transmission.
Look at this TV in its right dimensions, it's a common size similar to what's watching a play-off game or award ceremony of Oscar awards.
Fox News, whose journalists strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was preceded by an average of 5,69 million television viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place, ABC is located with 3.26 million television viewers.
They followed CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2,94 million, MSNBC with 2,89 million and CNN with 2,52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high and after the hearing.
Fleik was a protagonist in the Friday drama.
Following the statement by the Republican moderate that he will vote in favour of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning protesters disapproveing him as he was trying to get into the elevator for the hearing by the Senate Justice Committee.
He stood with the look low for several minutes as they disapproveed him, live on TV at CNN.
"I'm standing here before you," a woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Fleick said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors shut, he would have more to say at the Commission's hearing.
All cable television and transmission networks were covered live a few hours later, the senate Justice Committee's vote on promoting Kavano's candidacy in the Senate's plenary session to vote.
However, Fleik said he would do it only if the FBI investigated the claims against the candidate next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Fleik was partly convinced after discussions with his friend, Senator of the Democratic Party, Chris Kons.
After discussions with Koons and some other Senator then, Fleik decided.
Fleik's choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not gather votes for Kavanaugh's approval without an investigation.
President Trab requested an FBI investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics that they play games with Brexit
Prime Minister Teresa May accused the critics of the retreat plans from the European Union of playing political games with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Teresa May arrives for the Congress of the Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview along with her own in the newspaper's headline, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson has been scrupulously critical of the Brexit Cheers Plan, saying that the proposal to collect duties between Britain and the EU was "finitely absurd".
Shoting Wade Simms: Police arrested suspect Diedon Simpson for the murder of the player in LSU
Police arrested a suspect for the killing shot of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Diateon Simpson, 20, was arrested and held in prison for second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have a video in their hands from Sims' confrontation with Simpson, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The cops spotted the glasses at the crime scene and said they traced traces from Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB working with CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police said he admitted to trampled Wade deadly.
His approach was set at $350,000 according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report of East Baton Rouge coroner released on Friday, cause of death is bullet injury in the head and neck.
The Ministry of Police of Louisiana has made available a special working group, the police crime lab, the South University police forces and the citizens of the region for assistance in investigation into arrest.
LSU Joy Aleva's sports director thanked local law enforcement authorities for "stop research and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Forward 1,98 meters grew Bahton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
He had an average of 5,6 points and 2,6 rebunds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU Owen's basketball team coach said the team was "contributed" and "in shock situation" from Wade's death.
"We are always concerned about incidents like this," said Owen.
Emissions of volcanic ash in Mexico City
The volcanic ash emissions from the volcano Potocadet arrived in the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Campaign Prevention Center warned the people of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, since the activity on the crater reached its peak, recording 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The Centre watched various signs and small seismic vibrations.
Images in social media show car windscreen covered with thin layers of ash in neighborhoods of Mexico City like Sochimilco.
The geophysics observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles south-east of the capital since a 7,1 castter earthquake in Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police forces conflict with Catalan separatists in view of the anniversary of the vote on independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a conflict of protesters in favour of independence with the class rehabilitation units, as thousands participated in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote on the crackdown in Catalan that caused polarisation.
A group of mascoist protesters in favour of independence, which was held by class rehabilitation units, spurred eggs and paint on dust, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
Complications have also been noted later during the day with the police to use their cages to make the complications.
For hours, groups of supporters of Catalonia's independence were calling the motto "We don't forgive, we don't forget" against groups of protesters in favour of the unity of the country that called "I live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with micro-traumatics that took place during the protests, according to the local type.
Tensions remain high in the area that supports independence a year after the referendum of 1 October as being illegal from Madrid, which is nevertheless being celebrated by the separatists Catalan.
The vast majority of the voters chose independence, although the turnout was low with those who oppose independence to boycott the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1000 people were injured last year, following the police's attempt to suspend the vote at the electoral centres in the area where violent complications occurred.
Groups in favour of independence camped late on Friday to prevent a national police support protest.
The protest took place others had to take a different turn.
Narcisse Terrmes, 68 years old, an electrician who participated in the demonstrations in favour of independence with his wife, said that he no longer had hopes of Catalonia’s prospects of winning independence.
"We experienced one of our most brilliant moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they were able to vote, but now the situation is steady," he said.
Although they noted a victory of vital importance although limited to regional elections in December last year, Catalan parties in favour of independence fought to maintain their dynamics this year, with many of their known leaders being self-executed or in custody pending their trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Poot, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded his phone protests in favour of the police, said the conflicts were powered by politicians and two camps.
"The tension is getting more and more escalated," he said.
On Saturday, Orol Zunqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who were detained last year, announced his candidacy to the European elections for the following year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the oppression of democratic values and the oppression that we have received from the Spanish Government," he said.
Londonter: Arrest a man after car impact in residence
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeated car crash in London.
The incident took place at Bolinagar Crescent on Thursday, about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was caused to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been some shooting in the car at some point.
Mega's hit gave Lingston a 1-0 win against the Radders.
Dolly Mega's first goal for Livingston has secured victory
The so-called Livingston exhaled the Rangers by giving Steven Jersey just his second defeat at 18 games as the manager of the Aybrox group.
Dolly Menga's blow made the difference as Garry Holt's side changed level with Hiberian in the second place.
Gerard's team remains without victory outside the league this season and faces the Harts, who have the lead with eight degrees, the next Sunday.
Before this race, the Rainers host Raped Vienna at Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston in the meantime continues her race in six games in her class, with main coach Holt still not lost any defeat since she replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses opportunities for visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead a long time before it scores, with its amnesty bringing the Rangers into a difficult position.
Scott Robinson has taken a lead and has cost to arrive just before the end, but Alan Lithgo has rejected his attempt by slipping Craig Halket's head off the end.
The fielders willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could beat visitors to the free strikes and horns.
And that's how the important goal came.
The Rangers couldn't stop a free blow, and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson cooperated to send the ball to Menga, who took everything and scored from the center of the area.
Until that point, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball but found the defense of the landlords impenetrable and lasting Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morello rejected the ball from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball was removed from his feet Rangers' hairguard Alan McGregor and Lithgo's all went out on another free hit by Livingston.
There have been many vertical ducks in the area of Libington and were constantly hovered, and two penalties were demanded - after Halket's ball was vindicated against the alternate Glen Midleton player and one for a hand - which was rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
Alsander Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony McKenna Park
Thematic performances and results for Livingston.
Everyone, without exception, was deplorable, going beyond expectations in this upward course.
The game style and their personality changed little after their return to top form, but the credits should also be given to Holt for the push he gave to the team with his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halkete was excellent, backing up an extremely organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Wornell alert throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the contrary, didn't have inspiration.
As good as they were before under the guidance of Gerard, they did not respond to these standards.
Their last game was incomplete - only once managed to pass the field defense and this is a warning bell for the Reangers, who are in the middle of the ranking.
Mixed feelings at Erdogan reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of Heads of State of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed at restoring relations with the allies in NATO.
They had come to a break with issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to launch a new huge mosque.
The city hosts the largest community of Turks outside Turkey.
The police ruled out for security reasons the concentration of the crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but many supporters were able to approach to see their president closely.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of whom have also given Kurdish origin - have also given the present, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German Government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The division of protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turkish Germans as a hero and others as a dictator.
Troop accident in Detload: cyclist death after car crash
A cyclist lost his life in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Detzer, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car driver stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the ground.
The conflict occurred a few months after a similar incident where a driver hit and left a cyclist, who lost his life on Childers Street, at a distance of about 1.8 miles from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are trying to identify the man and to inform their nearest relatives.
The roads have been closed and bus routes have been dipped, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Larin Police: Six Police wounded in Complications · Global Voices
Six police were injured in riots that broke out in the prisons of men of highest security, according to the statements of the prisons' Directorate.
The troubles broke out in His Majesty Long Laurin's prisons in Warstershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still in progress.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been attacked to deal with the turbulences, involving eight prisoners and manifested in one ward.
The police were hospitalized with micro-traumatics in the face during the symptoms.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel have undertaken to deal with the incident in His Majesty Long Lartin's prisons.
Six staff members were treated with wounds.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police authorities and may extend more sentences."
In His Majesty Long Lartin's prisons more than 500 prisoners are held, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the Administrative prisons were hospitalized after an attack by a prisoner.
In October of last year the class rehabilitating units were called in to put serious incidents out, during which members of staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City with sudden floods (drying areas may benefit)
It is rare that a tropical recession hurt Arizona, but this is probably happening at the beginning of next week, as hurricane Rosa's remains will cross the southwest of the desert, bringing floods to their passing.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued exceptional flood warning cards for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, South California and Utah, including towns of Phoenix, Flagsstav, Las Vegas and Solt Lake City.
The hurricane Rosa is expected to pass right over Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will be late on Monday with rain.
Phoenix National Meteorological Service tweeted that only "Twenty tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low barometric state less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane at a distance of less than 40 miles from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the US National Typhoon Centre provide for rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rain volumes of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rim, Arizona.
In other regions of the Southwestern States, including central Rocky Mountains and Gret Basin, rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches are likely to occur, with the possibility of individual total rain tumors up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk of floods, the rain that Rosa brings may be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rain is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwest are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the US Dry Watch, more than 40 percent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second higher category of drought," the weather.com said.
First, the hurricane Rosa will reach the land in the California Peninsula, Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the hurricane, on Sunday morning Rosa will be 385 miles south of Pounda Euntzenia, Mexico with a maximum of 85 miles an hour and will move to the north at a speed of 12 miles an hour.
The storm will meet cooler waters in the Pacific and will therefore be weakened.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the land in Mexico with a tropical storm intensity this afternoon or Monday night.
There may be strong rainfall in areas in Mexico, which will cause a significant risk of floods.
"We expect total rain volumes of 3 to 6 inches from Baha California to northwest Sonora, which may reach up to 10 inches," according to the weather.com.
Then Rosa will head north by crossing Mexico as a tropical storm now and reach the border of Arizona early in the morning of Tuesday as a tropical low barometric, which will then pass through Arizona to reach South Yuta late on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected by hurricane Rosa or his remains is the very intense rainfall in Baha California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwest States of the United States," said the US National Typhoon Center.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous intense floods and winter muds in the deserts and landslides in mountain soils.
Attack to Midsomer Norton: Four Arrests for An attempted homicide · Global Voices
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspects of attempted homicide following the detection of a 16-year-old who brought knife wounds to Schorersett.
The boy was found injured in the Mydsomer Norton Execsior Terrace, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
She was transferred to the hospital, where she remains in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old, and a 20-year-old man were arrested during the night in the Randstork region, Avon and Somerset police said.
Cops call on anyone who might have recorded on his phone what happened.
Trab states that Cavano "live the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favour of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous members of the Democratic Party," said Trab at a concentration in Willing, West Virginia.
Trab said Kavanaugh "live the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his entire process of showing as a candidate.
Kavano testified to Congress on Thursday, denying categorically and emphaticly the claims of Christine Blaisi Ford that he was sexually attacked decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also filed a hearing on her allegations.
The President said Saturday that the "American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Cavanaugh that day.
"The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh's candidacy is a vote confirming one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a legal with an excellent course of public service," he told the many supporters in West Virginia.
The President talked indirectly to Kavanaugh's candidacy and talked about the importance of the Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"We have five weeks of one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am," he said.
"That's why I'm traveling everywhere supporting exceptional candidates."
Trab said the Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the candidacy of Cavano is expected to take place no later than Friday, told the CNN a senior member of the Republican Party's leadership.
Hundreds of people were killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is projected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were drifted from the giant waves that scanned the coast, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Sulausey island of Indonesia, the authorities said Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palos on Friday, when waves of height of six meters slipped the water on the land, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
Tsunami was manifested after an earthquake of 7,5 Ringer.
"When the threat to tsunami last night, the world was still on the beach and didn't run immediately, so it was hit by it," said Sutopo Pulgo Nugroy, representative of Indonesia's BNPB disaster response service, in briefing Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, dragged cars, woods, houses, hit everything on the land," Nigcrochos said, adding that tsunami had travelled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Paul.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster relief service show many ruined buildings and shops, bridges that have been destroyed and collapsed and a water-contained tent.
Relocations continued to hurt the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) announced that the energy released from the huge Friday earthquake was approximately 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb that fell in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The geography of the city, which is at the end of a narrowly long bay, may increase the size of tsunami, said.
Nogcross described the damage as "extensive" and said hundreds of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels collapsed.
He said that the victims found themselves trapped under the wreckage of buildings that collapsed, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Negrocrochos said that the victims and damage may be greater along the coastline of 300 km north of Paul, in an area called Dogala, which is closer to the center of the earthquake.
The communication systems "extremely produced and there is no information" from Dongala, she said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," Red Cross said in a statement, adding that his staff and volunteers are heading towards the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy and may even worse," he said.
Wrong criticism was exercised at the Office on Saturday because he didn't know that tsunami had hurt the Pulus, although according to the officials the waves had reached the time when the warning was issued.
In an amateur video released on social media, it sounds like a man on the top of a building shouting panic in trying to warn people down the road for the tsunami coming.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water plows on the coast, dragging houses and cars.
Reuters agency was unable to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a great break in power, which also interrupted communications in the wider region of Paul, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts by the authorities.
The army started sending transport planes from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but displaced persons still need desperate food and other basic species of first need.
The airport of the city has only reopened to help and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Wideondo has been scheduled for a visit at the evacuation centers in Pachos on Sunday.
The victims of tsunami in Indonesia exceed 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although the staff of World Vision from Dogala managed to arrive safely in the city of Patu, where the workers found shelter in accommodation from museums set up in their office, they passed through scenes of destruction in their course, Mr. Doceba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of ruined houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some aid groups have undertaken the sad task of launching the relief process of the wounds, some denounce that it was not allowed to foreign, particularly experienced workers in the field of aid to travel to Paul.
According to the Indonesian regulations, the flow of funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may only begin if the place of a disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
This has not happened yet.
"It is still a disaster at the level of the province," Aulia Arriani said, representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says this is a national disaster, we can send out a request for international assistance, but there is no decision yet."
As the second day passed in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and family of those who are still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less grievous.
On Saturday, a little boy recovered from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days next to her mother's dead body.
Gunton Subanton, coach of the Indonesian national parachute team, had trained two of the missing parachutists for the Asian Games, who ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Madaji, were his students.
"The oldest in the sport of the parachute slope, I have my own emotional load," he said.
Mr. Gönton explained how, when they released the news of the collapse of Roa Roa Roa Hotel in the community of parachutists slopes, he began to send desperate messages to his opponents in Palau who participated in the festival on the beach.
However, the reading next to his messages was a gray symbol "n", instead of two blue.
"I think this means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves took away 26,750 dollars when the automatic take-over machine was loaded in Newport and Levy.
On Friday morning, thieves took $26,750 out of Brink's employee who was refuelling ATM machine in Newport and Levy, according to a press release of the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM machine to the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, policeman Dennis McCarthy told the announcement.
While he was busy, another man "was running behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects leaving the spot, according to the announcement, but the police did not identify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police, calling 859-292-3680.
Canoe West: Raper changes his name to Yi
Raper Canius West is changing his name to Yo.
By announcing the change to Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The one officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been listening to the Jeadian Yae for a long time and used this alias as a title in his eighth album, released in June.
The change preceded his appearance in the show Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album entitled Yandhi.
It replaces the singer Ariana Grade, who canceled her appearance for "sensual reasons", as the author of the show said.
Besides being an abbreviation of the professional name he is using today, West had stated in the past that the word is religiously important for him.
"I believe that the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, which means 'you', West had previously stated in a debate on his album title with radio producer Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanye, which means "the only one" to Yo, which is just a reflection of the good, the evil, our confused self, of all.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are."
He's one of the several famous rupees who have changed their name.
Shin Cobbs is known with different names, such as Pav Dundie, P.Dindy or Dindy, but he announced this year that he prefers the names Liv and Brather Liv.
A former West partner, JJEI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without a parrot and capital letters.
The elected President of Mexico vows that he will not use the army against the civilians
Mexican elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore that he will never use military violence against civilians, as the country is nearing the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression of students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, troops were shot against a peaceful protest in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when the left student movements gained roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed to supporting young Mexicans by awarding monthly subsidies to those who study and open more free public universities.
He stated that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities bring young people to criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China is more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this field, the investor and professional in the field of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This comment comes to add to announcements by various parts of the US government about artificial intelligence, as the US does not have a global formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year to become the world's first country in innovation in matters of artificial intelligence by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far short of the United States and seek to make the next major discovery in the field of artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of taking place in the United States the next big achievement in the field of artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (The superpowers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order of things) released this month from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the leading artificial intelligence companies in China, Face+.
In the 1980s, he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University in a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the best American Otheello player, while later he was an executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's annex to China.
Li acknowledged the importance of previous US government technology competitions, such as the USA Government's Protest of Robotics of the Advanced Defence Research Planning Service (DARPA), and questioned when the next one will take place to identify the next visionists.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain state subsidies, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the best of the academic space, it's the companies," he said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hijacked by universities to work on artificial intelligence issues in recent years.
Li argued that changes in migration policy could also help the USA to support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should be automatically offered to doctoral holders in artificial intelligence," he said.
The Chinese State Council issued a Project for the Development of the Next Generation Artist in July 2017.
China's National Institute of Natural Science provides funding to people in academic institutions as the National Institute of Science and other government organisations share money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Centre for Technical Intelligence, which will join partners from the business and academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee for Technical Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative named AI Next.
The US National Science Institute currently invests over 100 million dollars a year in artificial intelligence research.
In the meantime, no progress has been made for months in the US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Committee for Technical Intelligence.
Macedonian citizens hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
Macedonian people participated in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a move that would solve a quarterly dispute with Greece which had blocked the country's candidate for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, argues that the northern neighbour's name represents a vindication on its territories and has exercised veto on its way to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but national opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonian population.
President George Ivanov said that he will not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether participation will reach the required 50 percent to make the referendum valid.
The question on the vote was as follows: "You are in favour of NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece."
The champions of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim to be a price worth paid to seek membership of organisations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came to vote for the future of the country to allow Macedonian young people to live freely under the European Union umbrella, because so all of us will be safer," said Olivera Georgievska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several Members of the Parliament have declared that they will comply with the result of the vote to become final.
A majority of two thirds in parliament are required for the change of name.
The state election committee said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, participation reached only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, and the present was 66 per cent of registered voters.
"I came to vote for my children, our position is in Europe," said Jose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister, Zorov Zaev, Zorika's wife and Duko's son voted in the referendum on the change of the country's name that would open the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union to the city of Stromica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and puts chairs in front of scenes that have been set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the head up, not as second-class partners," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the European Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO's membership would bring multi-poor investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he voted.
He said a positive result would be "the confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, would take part in the referendum from 30 to 43 percent of the voters, i.e. below the required participation.
According to another poll carried out by Macedonia's Telma TV station, 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said he would vote positively.
In order for the referendum to be successful, participation must reach 50 per cent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government, since its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sherhy Award goes through Brighton's entire defense to put a goal
Sherhio Aweero and Rahim Sterling formed Brighton's defense by winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at Ethad Steinum in Manchester, England.
Awardo showed to score a cake in the 65th minute.
Argentine aggressor received all in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three Brighton's defenses before he was forgotten in the open space.
Then Awardo was found surrounded by four green players.
He crossed a defense, then escaped from several others on the edge of Brighton's big area.
Then he gave him everything to his left, finding Sterling.
Angel Warward made his first move in the area returning the ball to Awardo, who used his right foot to defeat Brighton Matthew Ryan's terrain, scored on the right side of the nets.
"Aweero is facing some problems on his feet," journalists, Citi's coach, Pepp Guardiola.
"We went to play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to score goals at that time."
However, it was Sterling who gave the galas the initial advantage of the battle of Premier Lig.
This goal came in the 29th minute.
Awardo took the ball deep into Brighton's area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Sane held his ball and led Sterling to the back beam.

Sherzer wants to beat the Rockies.
As the Niasians were excluded from the play-offs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But always competitive Serzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still any impact on the Rockies on the playoffs, as they precede by a game of Los Angeles Dodges in National Lig West.
The Rockies have gone to the playoffs with their 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock their first place in their charge.
"Although we have nothing to gain, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with fans and the other team will be a game probably the highest level that I will face this year.
Why don't I want to fight a fight like that?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who the original rally will be on Sunday, but it's alleged that they tend to let Sherger throw the ball.
Sherzer, who will make his 34th launch, has had practicing shots on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is usually a rest day for him.
The right-handed DC has performed 18-7 with an average profit margin (ERA) 2.53 and 300 out due to ankles in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trab speaks in West Virginia
The President has indirectly referred to the situation regarding his selected candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh, in his speech about the importance of the Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
It's a very important moment, I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I'm and, for that reason, I'm traveling everywhere to support exceptional candidates," he said.
Trab continued to say: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they're determined to take power back by using any necessary means.
They do not care who they are hurting, who they must destroy to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we are not going to give them."
The democracies, he said, have undertaken a mission of opposition and obstruction.
"And you see this in the last four days," he said, characterizing the democracies "thought and bad, lousy and liars."
He referred to the Crisis Committee of the Senate by name to the senator of the Democratic Diane Feinstein, which was accepted by strong disapprovals from the public.
"Remember her answer?
Did you uncover the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for an answer, this was a really bad use of the body language, the worst use of the body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad party.
It is not tolerable to those who express their opinion
I was not surprised at the fact that activists of the Momentum movement in my local group voted to be censured.
Besides, I am the last of a series of members of the Labour Party who have said that they are not welcome, precisely because we are telling our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan had a similar attitude because she was decisively opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticised because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbin.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy for national security, for Europe, paradoxically, on similar issues as that for which Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The call for the Nottingham East Labour Meeting on Friday said that "we want our meetings to be productive with everyone's participation."
In most of the eighteenths I am a local member of the Labour Party, the meetings of the General Commission on Friday night were just like this.
Unfortunately, today, it is not this tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate, more compassionate" policy has been forgotten for a long time, if it ever really started to be implemented.
It is increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership.
This just started after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I previously considered that we had similar political views started waiting for me to turn 180 degrees and to adopt opinions with which I would never agree, whether they were national security or the EU single market.
Every time I spoke in public, regardless of what I was really saying, I was listening to a scam in social media, where people asked for my rejection, they renounced the policy of the centre and told me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than other my colleagues, as the comments that were addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my fellow Members who are facing a hammer of sexist or racist offense every day, but never retreat.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this time in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbin claimed last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad version and that with every motion of censure or a change in the rules of choice, the party's boundaries are being narrowed.
I've been advised a lot over the past two years not to rise up in space, not to talk too much, and that's all gonna be okay.
But I didn't go into politics to do this.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student still, because of the neglect shown by the Thacher government, which literally led to the failure of my entire class, I was intended to promote better public services for those who need them most, either as a member of the local council or as a minister of the government.
I never hid my policy, and I did so in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have confused in any way with regard to my political views and points of disagreement with today's leadership.
To those who have put forward the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that, while the country faces a Brexit that will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in fact, my only message is not addressed to the members of the Momentum movement in Nottingam, but to my voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political feasibility will prevent me from acting as I believe it is in the best interest of all of you.

Iir - Melrose: 38 - 17: Invincible Iir climbs to the top
Two delayed goals may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ir deserved to triumph into this extremely recreational race of Tenent's championship.
It is now at the top of the ranking, the only defeated group from ten.
Finally, it was its highest defense, as well as the best use of opportunities, which made the scale for the fielders and coach Peter Murchi a good reason to be satisfied.
"We've been tested in our toys so far and we're still invincible, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said, "Congratulations on Iir, took advantage of opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, with Fraser Klemo's conversion, brought Iir forward, but a yellow card to Scotteso Rory Hugs, who was released for the game by Warriors, allowed Melrose to exploit the numeric advantage and Jason Bagot noted a goal without conversion.
Cleo has increased Iir's head start with a Penalty before he scored, right in half-year-old, a goal by conversion, leading Iir to the locker room with scores of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Bagot's conversion, reduced the lead to five degrees.
There was a long waiting because of a serious injury to Ruarid Not, who was removed by hand, and, after the reopening, Ir increased the difference with a Stifford McDoal's goal, with the conversion of Klemo.
The alternate leader Blair Mcportson then took a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the numeric advantage with Bruce Colvin's goal without conversion, after a time of intense pressure.
The landfields came back, however, and, when Struan Hitsinson got a yellow card for a stall in Klemo without the ball, from the Penalty line, Macferson noted a goal at the back of the attack that Ir plunged.
Klema has been transformed, as he has again done almost since the relaunch, after Kyle Rowee first gathered David Armstrong's kick and sent extrem Gregor Henry away for the fifth field goal.
Still Game Championator Starts new career in focus
The protagonist of the Still Game Fort Kiernan shows ready to move into the focus industry, after it was revealed that an authorised restaurant company has been designated director.
56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis on BBC's popular show, which he writes, and he has been collaborating with his partner for years in Greg Hebphi's comedy.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth cycle would be the last of the show, and it looks like Kirnan plans his life after Gageland.
According to the official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress refused to comment on the information, even though Scottish Sun source implied that Kirnan wants to deal with the "flying industry of the focus" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": The enclosed Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way towards the Pacific
Navy patrols at La Paz's fully equipped naval headquarters.
In public buildings, there are blue flags.
On the foundations of the navy from Lake Titicaka to the Amazon, the motto is written: "Our sea is rightfully owned by us.
It's our duty to get her back."
Throughout landlord Bolivia, the memory of the coastline occupied by Chile after a bloody conflict for the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the hail of its people traveling to the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have now come up more than ever, for decades, as Bolivia expects the decision of the International Court on 1 October after five years of consultation.
"Volivia has the dynamic, a spirit of unity and calmness, and of course she expects the result with a positive look," said Roberto Calzantila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the extradition of the International Court of Justice in large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia's vindication to force Chile, after decades of unstable talks, to negotiate for the granting to Bolivia of a dominant exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic autonomous president of Bolivia, who is giving a controversial battle to re-election next year, has a lot to win or lose since Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is not likely to decide in favour of Bolivia and that, even if he did, they would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to give thousands of territories and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision of the International Court is to be delivered only six months after the presentation of the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated", Paz Zaratte, a Chilean international legal expert.
And instead of further promoting Bolivia's targets, last four years may have undermined them.
"The current Bolivian government has narrowed the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has exhausted every remaining good mood in Chile, he argued.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after that.
The two countries have not exchanged Ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velgee, spokesman of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an excellent opportunity to launch a new era of relationships with Chile" and the possibility to "end disputes of 139 years with mutual benefits," he said.
Kalazantila also refused that Morales, who is still one of the most popular leaders of Latin America, is using the issue of leaving to the sea as a political fencing.
"Bolivia will never renounce her right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," she added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past."
North Korea declares that there will be no nuclear disarmament if it cannot trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if he cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the leaders of the two states.
Ri made these comments while U.S. Foreign Minister Mike Pombeo seems ready to start the nuclear diplomacy that had arrived at a stall three months after the meeting in Singapore with the leader of North Korea, Kim Yong Uun.
Ree states that the view that the ongoing sanctions and the refusal of the United States to preach the end of the Korean War would at some time force the North to "fly" as a dream of summer night.
Washington hesitates to agree to issue the relevant declaration if Pennyang does not first make significant disarmament moves.
Both Kim and the American president, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there is widespread scepticism about whether Punyang is seriously thinking of denouncing a weaponry that the country most likely considers to be the only means of guaranteeing its security.
Pombeo plans to visit Ponniyang next month to prepare a second Kim-Tramp summit.
Paris fashion displays reveal the latest trends in the oversized hats that will soon be available at a store near you
If you want to raise the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
Valentino and Tom Brown designers presented to the pasela a series of other oversized caps for their collection Spring-Korkari 2019 that stole the performance at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and designers sent them their impressive creations to the parsela.
The part that broke out of Valentino was an excess beige hat decorated with a wide mall with wings that completely covered the head of models.
Among other oversized accessories were presented watermelons decorated with stones, a cap of magic, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had broken lips and reported more to Hanipal Lecter than to high-ractic fashions.
One creation brought to mind complete diving equipment with a breathtaking and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream in a snitch.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you're lucky.
Strips provide that these huge hats could reach central commercial roads near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after the "La Boba", the straw hat with the very wide can we've seen wear so many, from Riana to Emily Rataikovski.
The popular Firma who created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media has yet sent a great creation to the pasarella, a sanctuary beach bag almost as large as the model that carries it by wearing its swimsuit.
The dark orange bag of shelves, decorated with shelves and a white leather handle, was the piece that separated from La Riviera Spring-Korkary 2019 of Jacquemus at Fashion Week in Paris.
The famous Stylist, Luke Armitage, stated in column FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and large beach bags in the shopping shops next summer, as the designer made such a great sense that it would be difficult to ignore demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland have prehistorics in academic excellence, which continued in 2018, with yet another series of excellent results in the exams, which were simply further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, arts, music and other Community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of services to their students and parents.
The aim of the independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and highest educational grades, the career that they will choose as citizens of the world.
As a educational sector that can design and implement a school course by order, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable course of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language that he understands, then what you say enters his head.
If you talk to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart."
This is a strong reminder that we cannot just rely on English if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year's examinations, we find that the languages are at the top of the performance tables, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying foreign languages achieved a degree of A Απολυτήριο.
Data gathered from 74 school members of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of the students achieved a degree of A in mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish had also grade A.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages today, as a selection course, are considered as important as science, technology, engineering and mathematics courses in the independent schools and elsewhere.
Research by the UK Employment and Skills Committee in 2014 revealed that, with regard to the reasons why employers were finding it difficult to cover empty jobs, 17 percent of the class concerned a lack of language skills.
The need to gain language skills is therefore becoming increasingly imperative so that young people are prepared for their future careers.
Since more future employment opportunities require language knowledge, these skills are necessary in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career that one will choose, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future because of this skill that will be able to use all his life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over competition.
According to a research by YouGov in more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of the respondents were unable to speak a foreign language quite well to have a conversation, while French were the only one speaking two-digit percentage of the respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investment in language teaching today is important for children today.
The knowledge of many languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find employment with meaning.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the most classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in 2020, such as mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested, there will always be some languages to choose in independent schools, which have specialized teachers in this area.
The independent schools in Scotland provide with devotion a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve, whatever the future holds for them.
We cannot deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to provide this option, multiculturalism and excellence for the young in Scotland.
They have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent School Council.
Lebron's gonna do his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The expectation of the fans who fail to see Lebron do his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers arrived almost at the end of it.
Lakes coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first game before the fight season against the Denver Nugts in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes it will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the official Λέκερs website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James will probably play a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans on the program of six games that the Lakers have to give before the racing season.
"I don't need any training games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trab Concentration in West Virginia, Canal YouTube
President Donald Trab starts a series of gatherings beginning with Willing West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trab gatherings next week, which include tours in friendly adjacent areas, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote to confirm his choice for the Supreme Court waiting, Trab seeks to strengthen popular support for the upcoming interim elections, as the Republican risk losing control of Congress with the November vote.
What time is Trab's concentration in West Virginia tonight and how can you follow it online?
Trab's concentration in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29th 2018.
You can monitor Trab concentration in West Virginia online by live flow in YouTube.
Trab is likely to refer to the hearings of this week for the candidate for the position at the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere because of the sexual misconduct claims, with a vote of confirmation of the Senate that has been put in place for up to a week while the FBI investigation is under way.
However, the primary aim of this series of mergers is to help the Republicans who are facing a firm outcome in the November elections to gain some dynamic.
Thus, the staff of President Trab's campaign said these five gatherings next week are aimed at "mobilising volunteers and supporters, as the Republican are trying to protect and extend the majority of them in the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is as critical for his agenda, which the president travels to as many states as possible, as we are heading in the multi-school period of the campaign," he told Reuters representative of Trab's campaign, who wanted to remain anonymous.
The concentration scheduled for tonight at Wesbanco Arena, Willing, could bring supporters from "Ohao and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the media of Pittsburgh", according to the newspaper West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month Trab visits West Virginia, the state that won over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trab is trying to help Patrick Murray, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is low in polls.
"It's not a good sign for Murray that the president should come and try to give him a push to the polls," said Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the courage to fight by keeping hopes alive as it walks to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided games, Saturday quarters in the afternoon might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The talented outlay of the momentum is a totally invented sporting idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such measurements.
Where would they say the moment is now?
"Then six degrees and now it's four fronts, so we probably have a little momentum," Jordan Spith said as he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of four degrees and to stay twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air on their sails" and have a lot to encourage them, such as the twin Spith and Justin Thomas they played together all day long and each has broken three points out of four.
Spith was deadly from tee to green and gives the example.
The voices of celebrations became stronger as he continued his round, making a crucial blow to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The blow by which they won the game on the 15th was accompanied by similar festivals showing his conviction that the American team is not out.
"You have to look inside and worry about your own game," Spith said.
It's what every player has left.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more grades than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flytwood, the undisputed story of Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable twin in Europe has achieved four at four and seems to be doing nothing wrong.
"Mollywood" was the only twin that didn't hit bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also left the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy viewers, inhibits the fact that they are the players who should win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Flytwood or Molinari to seal a possible European victory while the sun sets above Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory remains premature.
The Baba Watson and Web Simpson put the glasses on Sergio Garcia, the morning-fourball hero when he played with Alex Noren.
With a bogey and two double in front nine they had the Spanish and Swedish so deep in a hole that they couldn't get out of it.
On Sunday, though, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting struggles to track them closely because of interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how a strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a group so far and has a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome struggle also showed that the US team has the guts, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the lead 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of Ryder Cup after its head start in fourballs and the foursome Saturday with 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired twin of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made two victories against a fighter Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead to Le Golf National up to now in four degrees.
Thomas Bhorne's European side, trying to maintain the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the unstable American side in the morning fourball, with a set of 3-1.
The United States was more opposed to the foursome, winning two games, but couldn't cover the difference.
Jim Furick's side needs eight points from the 12 single races on Sunday, to keep the trophy.
Flytwood is the first European newly evolving player who wins four degrees, while together with Molinari, also known as "Mollywood", after a shocking weekend is just the second twin who wins four points in the first four races in the history of Ryder Cup.
By crushing Woods and Patrick Reid at fourballs, they joined forces to overthrow a tired Woods and American neoliberal Brison DeSaubo with an even more obvious 5&4.
Woods, who was dragged on the two Saturday games, showed occasional explosions of brilliantness, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourballs, returned to Henry Stenson's teammate for the foursomes with the 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brookes Keppka, occupying the first and third position in world ranking.
It didn't all go well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
The three-time winner Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas laid the bar for the Americans at two degrees on Saturday.
They won a hard win 2&1 on John Ram and Ian Poulter in Spain in fourballs and later returned to win the Poulters and Rory McKilroy 4&3 at foursomes while they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in the history of Ryder Cup a group was able to recover while losing with four degrees in singles, though because he is the trooper, Furick has enough to make a tie to keep the trophy.
However, after being found in the second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is outside their capabilities.
North Korea says it's not going to be disarmed unilaterally without confidence measures
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepen the sense of distrust with the United States and that his country will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the world's annual general meeting that North Korea had taken "major measures of goodwill" in the past year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing facilities and the commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we see no response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally start our disarmament."
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to the potential of a "static" denuclearisation approach, according to which North Korea will be rewarded as it gradually moves into the process, his statement was important as to not completely excluding unilateral denuclearisation, as Pinniyang did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint announcement of Kim Young Oyn and Donald Trab at the first summit held between an active US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on "nuclearization of the Korean peninsula", while Trab promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean war, but the United States has said that Pinniyang must first hand over its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the appeals to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed in North Korea.
"The USA insists on becoming "first denuclearisation" and increase the pressure by threatening with sanctions to achieve their goal of blackmailing, even putting obstacles to the "expiration of war", Ry said.
"The idea that sanctions can kneel us is a dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust."
Ri made no mention of a planned second summit between Kim and Trab, which the US leader pointed out in the United Nations earlier this week.
The Minister, however, pointed out three meetings between Kim and the South Korea leader Moon J-in over the last five months and added: "If the partner in the issue of denuclearisation was South Korea and not the USA, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead end."
Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the US's hinterland with North Korean ballistic missiles was inevitable because the "Captain President" Trab called Kim "falseman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened to "burden" North Korea completely last year, plunged Kim's courage to move forward with disarmament measures, but said that there should be still much and that sanctions must remain in force until North Korea is denuclear.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, saying "If two years, three years or five months, it's okay."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council will have to reward Pognigang for the actions it has taken.
However, US Foreign Minister Mike Pobeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and continuously until full, final and confirmed denuclearisation is achieved."
The Security Council unanimously adopted sanctions for North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to neutralise the funding of Pygnang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pombeo met with Rey on the margin of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pinning again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pombeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pennyang in July saying that progress had been made to denounce North Korea a few hours later that he had "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea committed itself to meeting Moon this month to annihilating a missile facility and also to a nuclear complex, if the United States were taking "responsible measures".
He pointed out that Kim told him that the "reverse measures" he seeks were security guarantees that Trump promised Singapore and promotes the smoothing of relations with Washington.
Harvard's Students are watching classes about how to rest quite
This year, a new lesson at the University of Harvard seeks all preschool students to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing bunch of culture of the whole study with the consumption of many cafes.
An academia found that students at the number 1 university worldwide often do not know basic things, for example how to take care of themselves.
Charles Teasler, professor of Medical Sleep at Harvard School and specialist doctor at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the lesson, which he believes is his first kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after a speech about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I just learning about it in my last year?"
She said no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleeping - something that surprised me," she said in The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sport performances as well as to improving general prosperity.
Paul Barrera, professor of Psychiatric at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said that the university decided to include the course when it found that students were lacking sleep within the week to a significant extent.
The mature course includes a series of interactive work.
In a section there is the image of a student dormant, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of coffee and light, how sports performances are affected by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of routine sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep withdrawal may increase the risk of infarction, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
We believe, however, that they have the right to know exactly as you have the right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke," Professor Chasler added.
Its culture of perplexing because you studied all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever increasing pressure to students means that sleep deprivation is a problem that is getting worse.
A lot of sleep, of good quality, should be the "music weapon" of students to fight stress, exhaustion and stress, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, resulting in a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californiaman studying Chemistry and Natural Biology, helped Professor Chaisler design the lesson, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said his lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a lesson throughout the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to attend a similar program before starting their studies in this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Chasler advised students to set an alert for the time they should go to sleep, as well as wake up for the wake-up time, and to know the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can decorate the circade rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Linningston - Rangers 1-0: Menga put scores on Jersey's men
The Rangers suffered another sad defeat outside of the seat, as Dolly Menga's Dolly Mega's sut led the decoupled side of Steven Jerard to defeat 1-0 in Liddington.
Ibrax's team sought to mark its first victory outside of the February triumph with 4-1 in Saint Johnstone, but Garry Holt's team caused the just second defeat of Gerard to 18 games as coach, leaving the group eight degrees behind Harts, which is the first to classify the Ladbrokes championship.
Mega hit seven minutes before the half-year-old and the inspiring Rangers' Roster seemed unable to return.
While Rangers is now falling into the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third, with just one goal difference from Hiberian first.
And Rangers may also expect other troubles, as supervisor Calom Spence had to receive first aid for injury to the head caused by an object that was thrown out of the platform.
Gerard made eight changes in the group composition and defused Air to the semifinals for Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same "Levy 11" composition that took a degree from Harts last week and would be happy how this charming machine was able to drown out every effort of the opponents.
Rangers may have dominated the occupation, but Livingston did more with the ball.
He should've scored in the second minute, when the first fare of Mega sent Scott Pittman into the area of Alan McGregor, but the average didn't find the ball.
A deep-separated kit on Kimgan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense mate Alan Lithgoo, all he could do was send the ball away from the beam.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the game at the last third.
Alfredo Morellos certainly believed that he should have won a penalty in 15', as he compared to Steven Loulles, but the referee Steven Thompson ignored Columbus' complaints.
Rangers had only two shots in a area in the first half, but Aibrax's former terminal, Liam Kelly, didn't worry at all from the head of Lasana Koolibali and Ovey Ezaria's subtonic sack.
Although Lavy was clearly below the expectations in the first 34 minutes of the race, no one can deny that he deserved victory for the effort alone.
Reyngers still failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher carried the ball on Scott Robinson, who kept his temper and found Mega that just completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the half-year-old by taking Kolibali off and putting Ryan Kent. The change responded almost immediately, as he pushed the ball to Morellos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to lure the guests in the style of the game she knows and enjoys, with the Lithgou and Halkets pulling away one long ball after the other.
Holt's side could've raised the difference to the end, but McGregor faced Jacobs straight, stopping him before Lithgo's attempt from the horn.
Rangers' alternate, Glenn Middleton, had another phase of penalty to the end, as he compared to Jacobs, but Thompson once again ignored it.
Almanak: Gaiger meter inventor
A page from Almanak Sunday morning: September 30, 1882: as today, 136 years ago and VALE... the day in Germany the future natural Johan Vilhelm "Hance" Guyger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detection and measuring radioactivity, and this invention eventually led to the device which is now known as a Gaiger meter.
Pylonon of science since then, the meter Gaiger passed into the sphere of pop culture, as in the 1950 film entitled Bells of Coronado, with the protagonists of the unlikely cowboys scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
"What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Guyger counter, used to detect radioactive metal elements such as uranium.
When you wear these acoustics, you hear the action of people caused by radioactivity in metal elements."
Evans: "Look at it, it's like crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63th birthday.
However, his name’s invention continues.

New anticancer vaccine teaches the immune system to see the problem cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise problem cells in the treatment context
The method includes the patient’ s export of immunocells and their modification to the laboratory
They can "dive" a protein that is common to various types of cancer and then releasing them
One tested vaccine exhibits hopeful effects in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method includes the removal of immunocells from the patient, their modification to the laboratory so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor J. Berzovski, from the US National Institute of Carcinus in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results show that we have a very hopeful vaccine in our hands."
As Professor Berzovski explained, the HER2 protein "is the driving force for the development of several types of cancer", such as breast cancer, ovarian, lungs and bowel cancer.
A similar approach to which Immunocytes are exported by patients and then "trained" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West defended Trab, wearing a hat with the MAGA slogan, after he appeared at the SNL.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was tried in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after an all-professed interview with US President Donald Trump and said he'd come down a candidate in the elections in 2020.
After presenting his third song for the evening, entitled Ghost Town, when he wore a hat of baseball with the slogan Make America Great Again (To make America great again), he gave a Republian against the Democrats and reiterated his support to Trab.
"Sometimes I'm talking to a white guy and he says, "But how do you like Trump?
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The SNL opened with a skunkie in which Matt Damon was staring, with the Hollywood star to rent Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee about the complaints made by Christine Blazzi Ford about sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't delivered, West's convict video climbed into social media from comic Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to clear West with this post.
Also, West protested to the public that he was not well treated in the background because of his hat.
"They got me into the backstage.
They said, "Don't go out with the hat."
They made me out of it!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "I don't know what I'm doing, I'm gonna wear superman's cape, because so no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were rejected at least twice by the public and the SNL's factors seemed to be in a difficult position, said Variety, with a person stating in the magazine: "In the whole studio he held dead silence."
West was summoned as a replacement of the last time singer Ariana Grade, whose ex-friend, Raper Mac Miller, had deviated a few days earlier.
West confused enough when he sang I Love It dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West supported Candace Turner, head of the TPUSA conservative team, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: TO AWAKE WORLD IN THE WORLD".
However, the show presenter, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just "his self and that's great."
"But I choose not to reward someone (appointing his music or clothing or supporting his "tens") that I believe is irritating and secreting ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we," he added.
Before the show, Raper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the one who was previously known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in the steps of Dindy, also known as Pav Dunti, Pafi and P. Dindy.
Raper Snoop Dog had changed his name to Snoop Lyon and of course the legend of music Before had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince (The artist once known as the Before).
Category of attempted murder for knife attack at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempting murder after a knife attack on a man at East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihamore, according to the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of First Instance of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star, Kit Harrington, criticizes toxic artery
Kit Harrington is known for the role of the swordman John Snow in the violent medieval series of imagination of HBO, the Game of Thrones.
However, the actor, 31 years old, criticizes the stereotype of a bunch of heroes, saying that such roles on the screen pass to young boys the message that they should be hard to gain respect.
Speaking in The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said that "something goes wrong" and wondered how to combat the problem of toxic indulgence in the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married his match at the game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, admitted that he has a "short view" on the subject.
"People, now, I think so much, where did we do the mistake with sickness?" she said.
"What do we learn to men as they grow up in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit thinks that television can be partly responsible for increasing toxic indulgence because of the male characters it promotes.
Continue: "What's innate and what's taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they must show such behavior to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
Clearly something has gone wrong with our young people."
The interview also admitted that he does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel of the Game of Thrones, after the end of the series next summer, saying "the end of the battles and the horses".
Since November, Kit will lead to the revival of Sam Shepard's True West project, telling the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actress recently revealed that meeting Rose's wife is the best he cut off from the Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in a row, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on," she said.
Rose imprinted Hygrat, John Snow's loveless loveless, the character that Ket is being played in the award-winning Emmy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China announced an increase of 14% in its populations living with HIV and AIDS.
Over 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
Only during the second quarter of 2018 reported some 40,000 new cases.
In their vast majority, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, marking a change in relation to the past.
Traditionally, HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been almost zeroed, as Chinese health sector leaders stated at a conference in Yunan Province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was degraded in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sexual contact with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to anti-HIV medicines in the context of the attempt to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters protests that a clerk leaked Republican Senator data, condemns "hazardous lies" and "conspiracy therapies"
This Saturday, U.S. spokesman Maxin Waters made the allegations that a member of her staff published personal information on the Wikipedia pages of the law.
The Democratic Member of Los Angeles argued that claims were promoted by commentators and websites of the "right extreme".
"Finds, lies and even more terrible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information is reported to include the residence addresses and the phone numbers of the Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatts of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown person from the environment of Capitol Hill during a hearing by the Senate Committee on allegations of sexual misconducts against the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kavano.
The leak occurred at some point after the three senators had interrogated Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with the Waters Office and published the data of a member of Waters staff reported The Hill.
"This unfounded claim is totally unaltered and gross lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been violated because of these fraudulent and false claims, was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally unaltered and gross lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticised on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleiser.
"This diaphragm is full of anger, Fleiser wrote.
"This shows that he does not have the courage to be a member of Congress.
When someone's accused of something he didn't do, he shouldn't be angry.
It shouldn't be shatter.
He must not question the motives of the one who blames him.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleiser seemed to compare Waters' reaction to the critique of the Democrats for Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by his critics of looking very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to dethronise Waters in the mid-term elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations."
"We will do anything to find the people responsible," he continued, "and answer all their acts that are devastating and dangerous for any and all of my staff."
Review of the film Johnny English Recovers - a hypotonic spy movie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new film with British character and this seems to apply in this revival of franchise action-cosmace films with heroes Johnny Ingles, which started in 2003 with Johnny English movie and came back in 2011 with Johnny English: Back.
Can this humorous self-shaped about how obvious we are going to make the nation's new export chance?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Ingles with the swollen eyes was able to renew his permission to do a mandarin for the second time. His name states that it is a broader comical creation designed for non-Greek cinematic viewers.
It is, of course, a secret agent who, while pretending to have the glow and the ways of a secret agent, brings a little to Clucos, with a dose of "main Bean" and something from the guy who played a single note on the musical theme of the film The Light Streets at the London Olympic Games ceremony in 2012.
It is also based on the traveler and international mystery man who once emerged from Atkinson's most forgotten TV ads by Barclaycard, taking the chaos on his path.
There are one or two nice moments in this JE's last movie.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in the comedy, however, humor is quite hypotonic and strangely paradoxical, especially at the moment that "serious" cinematographic franchise like 007 and Dangerous Mission now includes several comedy elements.
The humor seems to be addressed to children and not to adults and, in my opinion, the mad upheavals of Johnny Inglis are not as inventive and similar as Atkinson's vocabulary cheeks for Bin's passing.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cyberhacker has penetrated Britain's super secret website by taking the identity of all British agents on a mission to a great disappointment of the agent in a service that Kevin Eldon is putting him in a sadly small role for his acne.
It is the last drop for a compelling and ambitious prime minister who is on the verge of collapse because of political anti-Latinity: Emma Thompson is doing the best of this character that reminds Teresa Mai, but the script does not help her in particular.
Information advisers inform her that, as each active spy has been revealed, it should re-establish someone decommissioned.
And that means Johnny Inglelis, who is now working as manager at some aristocratic school, but gives informal courses for secret agents: here there are some nice scenes, as Ingles offers a spy-like academy of a very rock school.
Ingles is coming back to Whitehol for urgent information and reunits with Buff's former and passionate partner, who Ben Miller is rejoining again.
Buff is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which Vicky Pepperdin is not fully exploited.
So Batman and Robin of the gaffe for His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting the beautiful and fatal Benefits Bouletoba, which Olga Kirilenko is undergoing.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously charming by the charismatic billion technology that claims to be able to solve Britain's technological suffering: the threatening Jason Volta, which Jake Lacey is undergoing.
Ingles and Buff begin the odyssey of their pharsocody: disguised as waiters, they put fire in a turf French restaurant, causing chaos as they are trying to offend the luxurious yacht of Volta, and Inglelis causes anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality device to familiarize with the inside of Volta's house.
All tricks are used in this last scene, but as lovely and fascinated and if it is, it continues to reminiscent of a little childhood TV.
Medium stuff.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I wonder: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he really will grow up with his talent?
Workers disagree that they consider a plan for the British to work four days, but to be paid for a five-day period.
Jeremy Corbin's Labour Party is about to look at a radical plan for the British to work four days a week, but paid for a five-day work.
The party, according to information, seeks the bosses of the companies to channel the savings achieved through the revolution of artificial intelligence (ΑΙ) to the workers, giving them an extra free day.
Thus, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend without a reduction in their wages.
Sources say that the idea is in line with the economic agenda and the party's plans to return the balance to the workers.
The change in a four-day week week was approved by the Labour Association Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
Senior source from the Labour Party stated in The Sunday Times: "It is expected to announce a policy change before the end of the year.
"It will not happen at one night, but the four-day working week is a ambition that is in line with the party's approach to re-assessment of the economy in favour of workers, as well as the overall strategy of the party for industry."
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised four days of work in its general electoral campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not party politics and is not considered by the party."
The Secretary of the shadow government, John McDonnell, used the last week's Labour Conference to develop his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "the representative managers" and "the winners" to the public-interest companies.
The drafts of the shadow government also mean that today's shareholders in water supply companies may not get their entire share back, as a potential labour government could make 'restrictions' due to suspected irregularities.
It also confirmed the plans for placement of employees in corporate management boards and the creation of mutual funds to give 10% of private sector employees an annual dividend of up to 500 στερλίνα.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy are talking to the 60-page show about whether the FBI research on Cavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation of the charges against judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the findings of the service could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Peley, the 60-page correspondent, asked the Republican Senator John Kennedy and Lincey Graham if the FBI could undo anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy showed up more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, it's meant to be," Kennedy said.
"I said going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came to the stand, and asked him straightly: 'You did?'
He was unmovable, determined, categorically."
However, Graham's vote seems not to change.
"I have decided on Brett Kavanaugh and will need some explosive charge to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly refused it," Graham added, reporting to Christine Blazi Ford.
"And whoever has named, can't confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and well-known stars, but also an equally impressive mission: the elimination of global poverty.
For the seventh year, tens of thousands are expected to slap in the Great Lawn of the Central Park in the context of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi Bi and Sean Medes, but also to be aware of the real goal of the event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To secure a free ticket at the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "acts", such as stating volunteers, sending an email to a global leader, calling or finding other essential ways to contribute to awareness of their goal of poverty eradication.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action or is it just another case of the so-called "clika activism", when some feel that they really make the difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Group has said that it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, promoting a number of different objectives.
He states that these actions helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which are going to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least 10 billion dollars have already been disbursed or collected.
The group considers that the secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the main commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British association of investors and implementers, who have undertaken "to help children fully exploit their capabilities", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to eliminate subsistence, having received over 4,700 tweets by members of the Global Citizens community.
"With the support of the UK Government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of subsistence a footnote in history," said Tracy Ulman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, to the public during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following the 5,000 actions called on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced the funding of a project entitled The Power of Nutrition, which is addressed to 5 million women and children with food interventions.
In response to the question "what makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" which is included in the frequent website's questions,
a member of the Global Citizen community replied: "The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all the major human rights movements and against apartheid before us, we will succeed because we together are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Medes, Cardi B and Janel Mona are some of the artists who will show up in this year's New York event, which Deborah-Lie Farnes and Hyu Jackman will present.
The United States can use the Air Navy for "closing" by blocking Russia's energy exports - Minister of Interior
Washington can turn "if needed" to its Civil Navy to prevent Russian energy being placed on markets, including the Middle East, as revealed by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where he is trying to call the legitimate government, is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe that the reasons for which they are in the Middle East are that they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern and South Europe," he said according to information.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States can, with the support of the Air Navy, ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, exclude them to ensure that Russian energy is not placed on the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees in an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group characterised as the "telephone of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to the treatment of Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, a little too, the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said referring to Russia with the term "pillar that knows only one trick", as it has an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements were made as Trab's administration has undertaken to strengthen US's exports of liquefied gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the administration of Trab, including President Donald Trab himself, is trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" work for Nord Stream 2 pipeline which, according to Trab, will make Berlin a "accessible" in Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2, a project with a budget of USD 11 billion, which is going to double the existing pipeline capacity in 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington’s firm resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the gas supplier they want," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Minister for Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude caused Germany's reaction, which stressed its commitment to the implementation of the project.
Germany's leading organisation for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), called on the US to abstain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dunder Kebb, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider declaring a nomination for the Presidency in 2020, the Massachusetts Senator said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he would seriously consider declaring a candidate for the Presidency after the interim elections.
At a meeting at the town hall of Hollow, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our troubled government, and that's why it takes a woman to the top," she said The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider a candidate for the Presidency."
Warren criticised President Donald Trab during the meeting, saying "it leads the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trab does to our democracy," he said.
Warren didn't bring up her words about Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "naturally and it is necessary to investigate the FBI before the vote".
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Waren's voters do not believe that they should nominate the Presidency in 2020.
58% of Massachusetts voters said the Senator should not be appointed, according to a poll by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
32% were in favour of such a candidate.
The poll showed more support for a potential candidate by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% being in favour of a possible candidate and 48% against.
Other popular names from the Democrats discussed in connection with a possible candidate for 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Baiden said he would have officially decided by January, according to Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to the Trak Palin Posttraumatic Stress Disorder at the Donald Trump Concentration
Trak Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he was recruited in September.
Arrested and accused of domestic violence on Monday night
"With what my son has gone through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of the Transtramatic Stress Disorder and the injuries our soldiers have carried when they return home," he told the public in the context of a concentration on Donald Trab in Toulsa, Oklahoma.
Peelin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said about her son and other veterans that "they return a little different, return harder, come back into question if there is respect for what the soldiers, the airmen and every other member of the army have done."
He was arrested on Monday in Wesila, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, of interference in a report on domestic violence and a weaponry while in a state of drunkenness, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the police department of Wesila.
18 states and the Columbia region support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Columbia region are supporting a legal question of the new US policy that refuses to provide asylum to victims who are trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the region submitted a report by amicus curiae on Friday in Washington supporting a asylum seeker to challenge politics, NBC News said.
The full name of the defendant in the Grass vs. Sisians action lodged by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She stated that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her, however, US officials rejected her request for asylum on July 20th.
He was held in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing intense problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Committee on Appeal on Migration (BIA) and allowed undeclared immigrants who are escaped from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District's Prosecutor General Carl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "women whole decades of state, federal and international law".
"According to federal law, all asylum requests must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application.
The lawyers also claimed in the report that the policy that refuses entry to immigrants damages the US economy, suggesting that they are more likely to become businessmen and "become a necessary workforce".
In June, the Prosecutor General Jeff Sesion has ordered the immigration judges no longer to grant asylum to victims who are trying to escape from domestic violence and gangs.
"Edence is available for those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political view," Sesion said in his communication of 11 June on politics.
The purpose of asylum was never to relieve all the problems (even the most serious) facing people daily around the world.
Unknown rescue efforts in Paul, as the number of dead is doubled despite the struggle for survivors' finding
For survivors, the situation was constantly worse.
"It's very intense," said 35-year-old Riza Kusuma, trying to relieve her baby that had fever, at a evacuation centre that stood in the damaged town of Patu.
"Every minute the ambulances bring other bodies.
The clean water is rare."
Some residents tried to return to their ruined homes and gather through their water their existing ones, trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 size earthquake in the Richter scale, were unable to meet the needs.
Some injured, such as Dwy Harris, who was devastated by the middle and shoulder, stayed outside the Old Army Hospital, where the first aid was delivered to the country because of the continued strong transformations.
Deep flooded his eyes, as he was telling how he felt the violent earthquake shakes the room on the fifth floor of the hotel sharing with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save.
I was trapped in the wall debris," Harris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife shouting for help, but then he prevailed silent.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
The U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "provocative ads"
A week after official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertising in a daily U.S. newspaper defending the mutual commercial benefits between the US and China, the US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to break its propaganda.
US President Donald Trab referred last Wednesday to China's payout press that appeared in Des Moines Register, the newspaper with most sales in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to mix in Congress's elections on November 6, a charge that China refuses.
Trab's accusation that Beijing attempted to mix in the US elections marked what US officials reported to Reuters is a new phase of Washington's fast-moving campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is not prohibited for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in a escalation of trade war and have imposed mutually different import duties.
China's tariff retaliatory at the beginning of the commercial war aimed at hurting exporters in states such as Iowa that supported the Transb Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor with long-term mandate in Iova, a state that is an important exporter of agricultural products in China, said Beijing had affected the workers, farmers and businesses of America.
China, as Bronstad wrote in an opinion article in Sunday Des Moines Register, "is committed to this kind of intimidation by publishing pro-professional ads to our free press."
"In the effort to disperse this propaganda, the Chinese government exploits the valuable tradition of freedom of speech and the free press of America by publishing on a fee advertisement to Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the periphery of Beijing, you will find little divergent voices and no real representation of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic path, since SMEs are under the control of the Communist Party of China," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers left the offer to publish" his article, although he did not reveal who.
Republicans alienate women voters in front of the interim elections because of the fiascus with Kavanaugh, the analysts warn
As many leading Republicans continue to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court Bret Kavanaugh in spite of complaints about sexual abuse, analysts warn that there will be a reaction, especially from women, in the next interim elections.
The emotions on this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have declared that they would like to proceed with the vote.
These things cannot be restored," The Hill Grand Rier, professor of Political Sciences at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubted that the last time of Senator Jeff Fleick to ask for an investigation from the FBI will be enough to attract angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and they are certainly not going to forget it in November," Karin Jean-Pierre said on Friday, a senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive movementOn, according to the Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters called the motto "November comes!" on the senate runway as the Republican who controlled the Judicial Committee gave the green light for the candidacy of Cavano, despite Dr. Christine Blazzi Ford's testimony, Mic said.
"The excitement and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels," said Stu Rodenberg, an uncompromising political analyst, on the news site.
Say it's already high, and that's true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of unreasonable women voters in the suburbs and youngest voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while dislike the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement in detail described her complaints of sexual abuse against the candidate for the Supreme Court, the analysts had predicted that there could be a reaction if the Republicans proceed with the debt.
"It is a huge chaos for the Republican Party," said Michael Syl, former chairman of the National Republican Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It is not just about the vote on the committee or on the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be put out. It is about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they were brought to her," Gai Sesil pointed out on a news channel, director of the Group of Presidents USA helping to elect the Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be a little divided about who to believe after the statements of Fortn and Kavanaugh, revolting slightly more in favour of the second.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said he certainly or she probably believed Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said he believed that Cavanaugh probably or definitely lied to his statement, while just 30% said the same about Ford.
After Fleick's move, the FBI undertook to investigate the complaints of Ford and at least one more complainant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian said.
Last week Ford sworn before the Justice Committee of the Senate that Kavanaugh attacked her while he was drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her birth organs while at a party, when both studied in Yale in the 1980 ’ s.
World Web inventor plans to launch a new Internet to compete Google and Facebook
Tim Berners Lee, the inventor of the World Web, launches a startup to compete Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new poem of this legend of technology is Inrupt, a company that is based on Berner Lee's open Solids platform.
Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses the Solid platform technology allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage space" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, pending lists, diary, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to be all available in a browser and all of this at the same time.
The unique feature of the electronic data storage staff is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls this possibility "personal enhancement through data".
The idea of Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to offer resources, processes and appropriate skills to ensure that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Berner Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some compiled programmers who worked in the project and a community of volunteer code developers.
Since this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners Lee said that he and his team don't talk to Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes by overthrowing business models in one night.
"We're not asking for permission."
In a post in Medium released on Saturday, Berners Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that protects the integrity and quality of the new tissue created on the basis of the Solid platform".
In 1994, Berner Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Technology Institute (MIT).
In recent months, Berner Lee has been a strong voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic for the next era of the Internet," Berners Lee added.
Bernard Van: Prison Tax in a Clergy Received Cross of Victoria in World War I · Global Voices
The only clergyman of the English Church who has received the Stavros of Victoria during World War I as a soldier was honored at his home for 100 years later.
Vice-Chairman Bernard Van received the medal on September 29, 1918, on the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out that he had removed the highest British military distinction.
Saturday became the remembrance of a memorial board of his two grandsons, accompanied by a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was a "extreme symbolic" that the tiles unpopulation took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather's heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Vice-Chairman Van led his order to the Canal of Saint-Kenten in a very dense fog and while he was given strong fire from weapons of combat and polybool."
Later, he pushed into the front line and with "extraordinary mania" led the line forward before he hit himself with a gun of battle three out of the passage.
Vice-Chairman Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's heroic actions were "that I know I could never reach, it's something that makes you feel unlimited respect."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also placed a wreath after the parade, led by the friendly news Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that "he felt a great price for parade" and added that "the matrimony of a genuine hero is evidenced by the support of many people".
MMA's fans rested to watch Bellator 206, but they saw Peppa the Pawnaki
Think of the following scenario: you are undressed to watch the fascinating Bellator 206, but you are deprived of the joy of seeing this unique sports event.
The program in San Jose included 13 games, including six in the main card, and would be presented live in the United Kingdom, from Channel 5 to the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gugard Musasy and Rory McDonald were about to come out to the ring, the viewers in the United Kingdom remained shaving when the show changed to Peppa the Wildy.
Some were not happy at all, as they had stayed awake until the first morning hours especially for the fight.
A Twitter fan described the promotion of the child program as "a kind of sick joke".
"According to legislation, this content was not appropriate for 6 in the morning, so the child program should be promoted," said Dave Spartz, Bellator's senior Vice-President for Marketing and Communication, when asked about transmission.
"Peppa the Pawny, indeed."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they are going to work out the program to include UK viewers in the future.
"If we think about the strippers, I think we can make it," Coker said.
"But it's six in the morning Sunday there and we won't be able to do it by Sunday, or their Monday.
But we're trying it.
Believe me, when the change took place, a lot of messages were exchanged backwards and they weren't friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the regulations.
I promise you that next time this will not happen.
We will limit it to the five matches instead of six, as we usually do. We have tried to offer more to the fans, and we have done so.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "lower" because of his sexuality
Olympianikos in dives, Tom Daily, said he grew up feeling down from the rest because of his sexuality, however, he pushed him to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't understand until high school that "he's not all like me."
Speaking to the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Lavern on Radio 4, he said he supported the rights of homosexuals to give others "spirit".
He also said that since he became a parent, he's been less interested in a victory in the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the well-known radio show, was on leave for several months due to illness.
As a guest at the first Laverne show, Dally said he felt "incomparable" compared to others when he grew up, because "it was not socially acceptable to like someone and boys and girls."
He said: "Today, these feelings of impulse and diversity gave me the strength and the will to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was "something," he said, so he wouldn't let anyone down when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-fold copper Olympianikos is a superb defender of the rights of the community of LGBTKI and took advantage of its participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to make an appeal so that more countries can move forward to the detoxification of homosexuality.
He said he decided to talk because he felt lucky he could live openly, without any consequences, and that he wanted to give some more hope.
The three times world champion said that "was a surprise" when he fell in love with a man, American cinematographer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Dally married him last year with Oscar Dustin Lance Black, who is 20 years older than him, but claimed that the age difference was never the subject.
"When you spend so much in such a small age" (the first time in Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) "is difficult to find a fellow fellow who has similar good and bad moments."
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Dayley, and Daily said that he changed his whole perspective.
"If you asked me last year, all I wanted was to win the gold medal," she said.
"But there are more important things than gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at 40 years of cancer in the brain.
Dally said his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they had made tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't say to him, Dad, you won't be around us to sit in the first row," he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and he was dead now I finally accepted that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Dally played in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I dreamed of all my life, to struggle with diving in the Olympic Games in my homeland, there was no better emotion," he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song, the Proud of Heather Small, who frozen him when preparing for the Olympic Games and still causes him creepy.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast to BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
The off-site Michaelson will sit on the counter on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Michaelson will write a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game at Ryder Cup, but he will have to improve his performance so he doesn't remember him for the wrong reasons.
Michaelson, who has been involved for the 12th time (the record number) in the games held every two years, was forced by leader Jim Furick to sit on the bench for the fourballs and the foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it is used to for the United States, the five-time winner shared the day to inspire from the lines and to "work" his game, hoping to correct his problem points.
Without having ever been the most direct driver in his career, the 48-year-old game is not suitable for the narrow court of Le Golf National, where long times are problematic.
And as if it wasn't the trouble of the field, Michaelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces Fransco Molinari, British Open champion, who works with the firstborn Tommy Flimtwood to win all their four games this week.
If the Americans, which were four degrees below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Mikelson's game can be critical.
Furrick expressed his trust in his player, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully captured the role he plays today, hit me friendlyly in the back, put his hand around me and said he'd be ready for tomorrow," Furick said.
"He's got great confidence.
His name is at the Hall of Fame and has offered too much to these groups, both in the past and this week.
I guess I hadn't counted him to play two games.
I was thinking about more, but that's where we ended up, so we thought we had to go.
He wants to get out there like everyone else."
Michaelson's gonna get over Nick Faldo's record for most Sunday Ryder Cup matches.
He could mean the end of a career in Ryder Cup that didn't reach the level of his individual record.
Michaelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven half, although Furick said his presence had benefits for the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, spiritistic, likes to make plates and he's excellent in the team room," he explained.
"I think younger players also had fun to experiment with him this week, and it was funny to see it.
His contribution is not just in the game."
The leader of the European team, Thomas Bourne, knows that the great lead can be lost soon.
Thomas Bourne, the leader of the European team, knows from his experience that a large projection that starts from the singles of the last day in Ryder Cup can easily become defeat.
Danus made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, where a team led by Sheve Ballestos managed to gain the advantage of five points against the Americans, but once he managed to cross the final line with a breast difference, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You constantly admire yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama, we had a great lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just barely," Büran said, in the picture, after attending the generation of 2018 to win 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday and lead 10-6 to Le Golf National.
So the story will show me and all the team members that this isn't over.
We're going all day tomorrow to give it everything.
We're gonna go out there and play right.
Nothing's over until you see the points on the board.
We have a target to win this trophy, and that's where we're focusing.
I always say I focus on our team's 12 players, but we know very well that in the other group there are equally good players – the best in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Birne adds: "I wouldn't have raped the result.
Tomorrow is another animal.
Tomorrow the individual performance counts, and that's something different.
It's great to be on the field with a teammate when things go well, but when you're out there on your own, then you try your top skills as a golf player.
This is the message you need to pass on to the players, how to get their best self out tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind, and he must also give them everything and show his best self."
Unlike Bhorne, Jim Furrick from the rival team will ask his players to show a better individual performance than they had with their teammates, excluding Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who earned three degrees of the four.
Furrick himself experienced both ends of the overthrows of the last day, as he belonged to the victorious team in Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every shallow word of his," he answered when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the leader in 1999, had shattered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like in Brookline, like in Medinah.
When we get this moment, there's a lot of pressure on the intermediate games.
We decide our turn accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we try to do our magic tomorrow."
Thomas has undertaken to lead the game and faces Rory McCilroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flytwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half row.
"I went with this group in this order because I think it covers the entire route," Birnan said justifying his choices for singles.
New postponement for the new German warship
The new fence of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will not be taken by at least the following year, due to defective systems and costs, local media report.
The position in service of Rheinland-Pfalz, the navigator of the brand-new fencers of Baden-Wuerttemberg, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which invokes a representative of the armed forces.
The ship should have joined the Civil Navy in 2014, but the problems with tradition were decisive for the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ships class Baden-Wuerttemberg ordered by the Civil Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen fences.
They will carry a strong cannon, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and missiles against ships, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and audio signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use the new fences for up to two years other than German ports.
However, the constant delays mean that, although the warships are considered as the last technology, which will allow Germany to show its power abroad until they finally enter into service, Die Zeit is already out of line.
The poor fence F125 became a headline last year, when the German Navy officially refused to pick up the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Air Navy returned a ship to a ship after delivery.
A lot of information has not been made about the reasons for the return, but German media have reported a number of important "software and hardware flaws" that would put the warship into disuse if it were used in a battle mission.
The problems of the software were particularly important. As the ships of Baden-Wuerttemberg class have a crew of about 120 seafarers, just half as compared to older Bremen fences.
It was also revealed that the ship has much greater weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add further upgrades.
The 7 000 tons fresh Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to have twice the weight of ships of similar class used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to defective equipment, costs for the whole project (including crew training) were also a topic.
It is said that it reached EUR 3.1 billion (3.6 billion), and the original budget was EUR 2.2 billion.
The problems affecting the new fences are particularly important as Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Civil Navy will soon have no ships for missions.
The official said that the problem has been escalated over time, because the old ships have been decommissioned, but there are no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg fences could join the Civil Navy.
National Trust hides the secret life of nights.
New research conducted on a property in Highlands, Scotland, seeks to reveal how bats use the landscape when they hunt their food.
The findings will bring new light to the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to the design of future environmental protection actions.
The study by National Trust scientists for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanocolour and microcolour, as well as the cafeteria and mycoside of Dobendon in the gardens Inverewe Gardens, in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the farm to monitor the activities of the nights throughout the season.
The staff and volunteers of NTS will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will verify the frequency of night calls, as well as what species have this behaviour.
There will then be a map of the biotope and a report in order to create a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Duwear, a natural protection officer for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the biotop are more important for bats and how they are used by every species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of biotopes management, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to keep forests for bats and other relevant species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the whole United Kingdom have declined significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by construction work and development projects that affect the parts where they grub and destroy their habitats.
The windmillers and lighting are also a risk, as well as colletic flies films and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, after hunting at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their will.
They use an advanced soundsetism technique to detect insects and obstacles to the course of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for caring over 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, considers nights very important.
It has ten trained experts, who carry out regular investigations, inspect the parties where bats are bored and sometimes rescue them.
The organization has also created the first and only refuge in Scotland exclusively for nightfalls in Threave, Dumphrey and Galloway, where they live eight of the ten species of Scott's nights.
The building manager, David Thompson, declares that the estate is the ideal ground for bats.
"He said here in Threave we have an excellent bat area," he said.
"We have old buildings, many big trees and an ideal habitat.
There's still a lot we don't know about nightfalls, so the work we do here but elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to see their populations grow."
Points out that it is important first to control the existence of bats before every maintenance work in dwellings, as the destruction of a single nest with small infants could kill up to 400 female and young women, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and are prohibited to kill them, harass them or disrupt their quietness, or destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Karel, a Bat Conservation Trust member in Scotland encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species simply do not know the development of their population."
Ronalto refuses complaints of rape, as his lawyers are about to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronalto described the allegations of rape against him as "fake news", saying some "will want to be self-protected" taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The aggression of National Portugal and Euventus is accused of raped an American woman named Catherine Magiorga in a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to the complaint, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and mention nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in a live video in Instagram to his 142 million followers after the complaint, Ronalto, 33 years old, described the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said Golden Ball winner five times on camera.
"They want to be self-protected and take advantage of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous using my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm happy and all good," the player added smiling.
Ronalto's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the claims he published, which they termed as "unacceptable reference of rumors that touch private life", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Skerts said the player would claim compensation for "the moral damage of the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of private life in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have happened in June 2009 in a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting them at a night entertainment center, Ronalto and Magiorga returned to the player's room, where they were allegedly raped rather than planting according to documents submitted to the County Court of Clark in Nevada.
Magiorga claims that Ronalto fell in the knees after the supposed incident and told her that it was by "99 percent" a "good guy", but he betrayed him the other one percent.
The documents indicate that Ronalto admits that they had sexual contact, but that they were conscious.
Magiorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her wounds were photographed, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because she was "afflicted" and was concerned about her "public humiliation".
34-year-old says she's trying to overthrow the settlement as she continues to suffer from posttraumatic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronalto was on the way to taking a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester Yunaited during the alleged abuse period and this summer he switched to the Italian Euventus by guaranteeing an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: The United Kingdom "will regret the loss of motor vehicles"
The United Kingdom "will regret itself forever", if he loses his reputation as a world leader in the car industry after Brexit, Minister of Enterprise Greg Clark said.
She added that it was "anxious" that Toyota UK told BBC that if Britain abandons the EU without agreement, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernaton, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr Clark.
The Japanese car industry said the impact of cross-border delays in the case of Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Bernaston, where the Auris and Avensis models of Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% was exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will be interrupted at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO in Bernaton.
Other motor vehicles in the United Kingdom have also expressed fears of exiting the EU without an agreement on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has declared that it will close Mini's factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern risks to the supply chain according to the car industry in the case of Brexit without agreement.
The Toyota production line follows the simple-in-time. The spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the United Kingdom and the EU for cars manufactured on order.
If the United Kingdom abandons the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be problems at borders, resulting in delays and lack of accessories according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep stock over a day at her factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Teresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically attempting to resolve the issue of cross-border controls".
"We need an agreement. We want the best possible agreement that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he said today BBC Radio 4.
"The elements that come not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to ensure the continuity of logistic chains."
Toyota was unable to say how much carrot would stop production, however, warned that in the long term the additional cost would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsuvalaris, who has been working in Bernaton for 24 years and is Unite's trade union manager at the factory, said that the members of the union are increasingly concerned: "From my experience, if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
Government spokesman said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trab's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House announces
The important meeting of Donald Trump with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein can "last another week", as the dispute on the candidate in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavano, announced the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special interrogator Robert Mooler, who is investigating Russian intervention in the elections, the links between Trab's assistants and Russia and the possible blocking of justice by the president.
The possibility that Trab fires Deputy Prosecutor General, jeopardizing the independence of Mouler, has been powering Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a wire in order to record his conversations with Trab and enable the president to be removed on the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein refused the report.
However, last Monday he went to the White House in reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trab, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced Thursday.
Trab said he would "opposite" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Committee on Judicial Affairs of the Senate in which he testified both Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blazi Ford.
On Friday Trab commanded the FBI to carry out an investigation within a week on the allegations against Cavano, thus delaying the holding of a vote by the Senate plenary.
Sarah Sanders, spokesman for Trab, showed up at the Fox News TV show Sunday.
I asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set yet, perhaps this week, but perhaps another week may be transferred to all other cases employing the highest court.
But we'll see, I like to always let the guy know."
Some journalists contradicted this claim: Sanders has had to make press updates in the White House since September 10th.
The presentist Chris Wallace asked why this was happening.
Sanders replied that the limited frequency of the updates was not due to a lack of mediation movements for TV journalists, although she said: "I will not disagree with the fact that they are being demonstrated."
Then let it be understood that it will be increased or directly contacted between Trab and the press.
"The President gives more interviews from any previous president," he said, adding without saying any figures: "We looked at these numbers."
They will continue to conduct updates, said Sanders, but "if the guy is able to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, this is incomparable better than talking with me.
We are trying to apply it often and you have seen that we are often applying it in recent weeks and will take the position of press information where you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trab often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with official visitors.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably demonstrated why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes unusual appearance before concentrated journalists.
The Minister of Health sends a letter to EU citizens working in Scotland's National Health System via Brexit fears
The Minister of Health sent a letter to the citizens of the EU working in Scotland's National Health System to express the country's gratitude and to wish them to remain after the United Kingdom left the European Union.
Jin Friman, a Scottish Member, sent a letter while less than six months away for the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to covering the costs of applications for a permanent resident status for citizens of the EU working in its decentralised public services.
Mrs Friman wrote in her letter: "At the summer the negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on departure continued and were directed towards expected decisions in the autumn.
However, the United Kingdom Government has also intensified preparations for a possible scenario of non-agreement.
I know that this period must be particularly difficult for all of you.
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I appreciate the contribution of every official regardless of nationality.
Fellows from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that enhance and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Ambercrobi undergoes emergency surgery after injury to the head.
Tennessee State Tigers' defense team Christian Abercrobi was subjected to emergency surgery after a trauma to the head of Saturday, where the Tennessee State Tigers were defeated with a score of 31-27 of the Vanderbilt Commodores, as the journalist of the newspaper Tennessean, Mike Organ.
Tennessee's main coach State Rod Reid told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-year-old.
"He came to the bench and just collapsed there," said Reed.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave Abercrobi oxygen to the bench and then put him in a locker room and transferred him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State member told Chris Harris from WSMV TV station in Nassail, Tennessee, that Ambercrobis got out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is no "even evidence about the type/extension of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrobi, a secondary student under limited participation status ("redshirt"), travels his first season to Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
He made five total taples on Saturday before leaving the game, thus reaching 18 total taples for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher fee of paper for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher fee of paper for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the extra money will be used to help the homeless, in accordance with the new Tori projects
The measure will eliminate the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the paper fee will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects to collect up to 120 million pounds per year - to assist the officers
Foreign buyers will begin to charge a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, while the extra money will be used to help the bourgeois, as Teresa May will today be announced.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more financial housing and to target high wages.
The increase in the billing fee will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the United Kingdom, while the additional sums of money will strengthen the government's campaign to combat the lack of housing.
The increase, which is imposed at the current paper ending, along with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes and residences for leases, may be at three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to produce up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built real estate in London is purchased by people not resident in the United Kingdom, leading to an increase in prices and making it more difficult for first-class purchasers to enter the real estate market.
Many rich regions in the country - especially in the capital - have become towns-bloods because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy is introduced only a few weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the end of the paperwork so that more young people can obtain their first residence.
He accused big construction companies of holding the prices of real estate high, yet gaining land without using it, and invited Mrs. May to abolish the backs in economic homes to restore Britain's "strong edge".
Mr Corbin has announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, including rental controls and banning extremism.
He also wants to give greater powers to councils to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "I said that I would devote my prime minister to the restoration of the British dream - improving life for every new generation.
And that means repairing the dissolved property market.
Britain will always be open for people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be right people who do not live in the United Kingdom and foreign-based companies buying houses as easily as hard-working British nationals.
For many people the dream of property has now become very distant and the unworthy of the lack of shelter remains exist."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to train the Scottish team"
Sanderland's leader, Jack Ross, says that his "exclusive ambition" is to become sometime the coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish is thrilled at the challenge of resurrecting the team of North-East England, which is currently in the third place in the Great Soccer Class of England (League One), three degrees below the top.
He moved to the Light Stadium in the summer after he returned St. Mireen to the Scottish Championship the previous racing season.
"I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team, and that's it," Ross said in the BBC, Scotland, on the Sportsound radio show.
"But I grew up seeing the Scottish team in Hamden all the time with my dad as a child, and that's something that always pulls me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I have a success in training teams."
Among the predecessors of Ross in Sanderland are Dick Advokaat, David Moyes, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poyette and Paulo Diane.
Aloa Athletics' former coach reports that he did not feel awe when so established names were called to be distributed to such a large group, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipsyic Town.
"This moment the success for me will be measured on the basis of the answer to the question "Can I bring this team back to Premier Lig?"
Because of the structure and facilities of this group, it certainly belongs to Premier Lig," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably consider myself successful here only if I can bring the team back there."
Ross started his career as coach just three years ago, having spent a while as an assistant coach in Dabarton and a period of 15 months in Hartz's coach staff.
Then he helped Aloa come back from the subway to the third class and led St. Mireen from the lip of the subway to conquer the Championship next season.
Also, Ross says he's more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Mireen and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he reminded me of taking over the position of Aloa's coach.
"I really thought I was more suited to being a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, I was making decent money from it and I had reached quite high.
But playing can be hard.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I'm still having hard stress and stress on work, but my coach's work is perfectly suited.
I always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I felt with myself all my adult life."

The best time for beer is at 5.30mm on Saturdays, according to research.
The summer heathen boosted the profits for Britain's tested pub but brought greater pressure to the restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars increased sales by 2,7 per cent in July, but restaurant profits decreased by 4,8 per cent, as revealed.
Peter Martin, from the CGA consultancy company, who gathered the evidence, said: "The continuous sunshine and the greatest of England's expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern with the previous month, in June, where the profits of the pubs increased by 2,8 percent, but restaurants were even more hit.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant income in June simply deteriorated in July.
The pubs and bars that serve alcohol took them far better, with the corresponding elements of the previous years going up more than they dropped the restaurants’ relatives.
Pubs serving food also suffered the sunny days, although not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In all handling pubs and bars, drinking sales increased by 6,6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM's recreation and hospitality analyst department, said: "These results verify the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and influence of major social or sporting events remains the greatest factors in sales on the non-domestic market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to be difficult, but the drop in sales by 4,8 per cent on an annual basis will be particularly painful given the continued cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have appeared at a worse time for businessmen in the focus area and time will show if the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a multipotheter extension."
The total increase in sales to pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, amounted to 2,7 per cent in July, reflecting the deceleration of commercial names.
The UK sales index Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses efficiency data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over 9 million pounds of England and is the established benchmark for the sector.
One out of five children keep secret accounts on social media, secretly from their parents
As the investigation reveals, one out of five children - even 11 years old - keep secret accounts in social media, secretly from their parents and teachers
Research in 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake pages ("fake Insta") in Instagram
This news adds the fears that sexual content is being dealt with
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main" account to show their parents
One out of five children - even 11 years old - create accounts on social media, which they keep secretly by adults.
An investigation into 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake "fake Insta" accounts - this is a reference to the Instagram photo communication website.
This news adds the fears that sexual content is being dealt with.
Twenty percent of students said they maintain a healthy "main" account to show their parents, while keeping private accounts at the same time.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret website spotted a teenager who urged others to rape her ("let me").
The study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the School Managers and Directors Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 years had two profiles, while half of them admitted that they were kept secret accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are tempting to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot track them."
Elied Doyle will be the athletes' voice at the Scottish board of track.
Elied Doyle was elected as a non-executive consultant to the Scottish verse board at the annual general meeting of the executive body.
Doyle is Scotland's most rewarded class athlete and President Ian Biti commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her widespread experience internationally in the last decade.
"Illint enjoys infinite respect in the entire Scottish, British and world class community and we are sure that the track in Scotland will have a huge benefit from entering the board," Battie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be the voice of the athletes and I really hope to be able to contribute and help to the guidance of the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the gold medal at 200 and 400 meters in Atlanta's Olympic Games in 1996, having won a total of four gold Olympic medals and is now a regular commentator in the BBC, remained paralyzed after a transient ischaemic stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: "Before a month I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will show whether and whether I will recover.
It was exotic, but I fully recovered, I learned again to walk, and today I am doing urticaria exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising a mammals that compares mothers with cows divides online public opinion
A mammals production company has divided the online public opinion with an advertisement comparing mothers breastfeeding with cows milking them.
In order to navigate the so-called "worldly first quiet and unsuitable female", the company of consumer technologies Elvie released a humorist advertising inspired by video clips to highlight the freedom that the new females offer to breast-feeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn of cows full of sand, with a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I'm denying myself, but you don't see any tail" and "If you didn't notice it, these are not masts, it's my tits."
The chorus continues: "Write it up, pick it up, feed babies, mix it up, turn it on, I'm milking my ladies."
However, advertising, published on the Facebook page, has raised online controversy.
With 77,000 screens and hundreds of comments, the video has collected mixed reactions from the spectators, as many say it does not take seriously the "frican" of the milk industry.
"A very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, but their babies steal them a few days after birth," someone commented.
Elvie's female female fits distinctively into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mira)
Someone else commented: "Obviously traumatic to both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise females for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "A completely out of reality."
Others defended advertising, while one woman admitted that her song seemed "satisfied".
"I think it's a very smart idea.
I'd buy such a sucker if I was still singing.
The pumping made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I don't have to overthrow it.
It's a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: "It's a funny ad targeting mothers pumping breast milk (common at their workplace or toilets) and they feel like "calls".
This is not an advertising which praises or criticises the milk industry."
At the end of the video the women's team reveals that they all danced with the distinctive females combed in their brass.
The logic behind the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who raise breast milk with a female female female female say they feel like cows.
The Elvie female, however, is completely silent, has no cables or pipes and separates distinguishingly into a bran, allowing women to move, keep their babies and even get out during the pumping.
Anna Balarin, a partner and Executive Director of Creative in Mother, commented: "The Elvie healer is such a revolutionary product that he deserved a bold and provocative mistake.
By making a parallel between breast-feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the focus on raising breast milk and all the challenges it is facing, while showing in a fun and correlated way the incredible sense of freedom that will bring the new breast milk.
This is not the first time Elvie star becomes a headline.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children appeared in the pasarella for fashion designer Marta Yakubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to camp at the Texas border
The number of children in custody has reached heights, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because hard rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trab administration have made it more difficult to match children with dependants.
Traditionally, most Conservatives are also immigrants without travel documents and fear that they will come forward and ask for a child and thus jeopardize their own possibility of staying in the country.
The risk was consolidated in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential Conservatives and other adult members of their household should give fingerprints and that the data would be communicated to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified before Congress that the service has captured dozens of people who were asked to maintain unaccompanied minors.
Later the service confirmed that 70 percent of the arrested had a white criminal record.
"After 80 percent of the people who are either dependants or members of the dependants' household are in the country illegally and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
We therefore continue to pursue these people," Mr Albens said.
In order to deal more quickly with children's cases, those responsible introduced new rules according to which some of these children should appear before a court within a month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as previously, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear through a pilgrimage conference in place of self-representation in order to develop their claims for granting a legal status before the court responsible for immigration matters.
Those who consider that they do not fulfil the conditions for exemption will be deported immediately.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to be nervous or distressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or attempts to escape, according to the workers in shelters and with reports that have been out of the system in recent months.
The lawyers said that these concerns are growing into larger facilities such as Tornio, where the evidence that a child is having difficulty is more likely not to be noticed because of the size of the facilities.
They added that the movement of children in the tent city without adequate time being given to prepare children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends may exacerbate the trauma they are already fighting with.
Syria invites US, French and Turkish "occupiers of occupation" to withdraw immediately
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al Muameb also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, even though the war in the country is now in the eighth year.
Mulem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism and "will receive proper response."
"The convention must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said.
Mulem insisted that "the war against terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions of others have been out of their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to give this sacred battle until we send out all the Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and update both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of the war country.
On the issue of refugees, Mulem said that conditions are good for their return and accused "some western countries" of "separating senseless fears" that prompted refugees to stay away from their country.
"We asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate these returns," he said.
"Climate a matter that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union warned that aid will not be granted for the reconstruction of Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition on the end of the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a destructive zone in the last big larvae of rebels in Indlyb created the opportunity to promote political debates.
The Russian agreement prevented an extensive attack from Russia's Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mulem, however, stressed that the agreement had "fair deadlines" and expressed the hope that military actions will target jihadists, including warriors from Al-Qaeda Front Nosera, who will "neutralize".
UN special envoy Stahan de Micheloura hopes to shortly convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the way for the elections.
Mulem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the committee's work should be limited "to the revision of the articles of the current Constitution" and warned that no interventions should be made.
Why Trab will win a second term
In this sense, Mr Trab will again win the 2020 elections, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the motion for censure and scandals end up his presidency prematurely.
Which would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending of the presidency of all time!"
So far there's no evidence of the spectators' fatigue.
Since 2014, television numbers in the high view area have been more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million in CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million in MSNBC.
The Fox News television has averaged 2,4 million television viewers in the high-television area, and four years ago it had 1,7 million, according to Nielsen and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has scanned the TV numbers on satellite television, with 3,5 million television viewers in evenings of important news.
It's a fire to which people attract because it's something we don't understand," said Neil Bair, a producer of ABC's dramatic series "Designated Survivor" (Business of the Next Day) where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Neel Skovel, Veteran signer of comic series and author of the book entitled "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
Her driver said that she would vote for Mr. Trab.
Did he ask why?
She said, "Because she makes me laugh," Mrs. Scoovel told me.
You can even have fun with chaos.
Of course, contrary to what happens to TV series, the scenarios that come out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy case against Wade, if the families of migrants can re-establish the health of the world economy.
The change of frequency is a luxury that only the most privileged television viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of the informed citizen when you are for six hours watching a group of experts discuss the use of "great interviews in the background" by Bob Woodword for his book "Fear" ("Fobos"), the bomber jacket of Paul Mana loaded with a skin of silhot worth 15,000 dollars ("a garment full of hybri", according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the clear descriptions made by St. Daniels on the anatomy of Mr. Trab.
I'll never see Super Mario the same way.
"What he does and who gives you the sense of the reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the TV program "Pawn Stars", about constantly changing actors and daily reversals in the plot of Trab's performance (extensified fight with N.F.L., praises Kim Young Uyn).
You don't have the luxury of losing an episode, or you stay back.
When I met with Mr. Flas this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees Celsius out of his house on the north coast of Kawai, but he was closed in seeing MSNBC while filming CNN.
He couldn't get away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was going to attend the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanged by a thief.
"I'm afraid we used to make those wrestling shows and people said, "This will mean the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Flase told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right after all."

Outside money is entering the most marginal measurement for the interim elections
It is no surprise that the 17th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress accepts a flow of money, thanks to the relaunching of the Congress's electoral districts, which set two active Congress candidates for the same position.
This recently redesigned Pittsburgh suburban region is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamp, who was elected to another region in special elections held last spring.
Lamp has as an opponent another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the former 12th Pennsylvania constituency, which is largely coincided with the new 17th constituency.
The maps were redesigned following a decision by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which decided in January that the old regions were manipulating unconstitutionally for the benefit of the Republican.
The electoral county in the new 17th electoral region triggered a financial competition campaign between the largest financial parts of the parties, the Committee for Democratic Campaign for Congress (DCCC) and the Committee for National Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamp became popular in Pennsylvania after winning a specific electoral count in March for the 18th Pennsylvania constituency in Congress, which has attended many people.
This post was held by Republicans for over a decade and President Donald Trab won the region for 20 degrees.
Politicians analysts give light to the democracies.
The United States looked at the possibility of punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but did back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognised Beijing, causing mild reactions from Washington.
Mr. Trab had a warm meeting with the President of Panama Huan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was maintaining a hotel in Panama until the co-workers expelled the Agency's management team.
State officials Departmed decided to call the American diplomatic mission chiefs from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama on account of the "short decisions not to recognize Taivan anymore", as Heather Nawert said earlier this month, the agency's press spokesman.
However, the imposition of sanctions was considered only against El Salvador, which was estimated to have received approximately USD 140 million as US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial support and targeted limitations on passport visas, would be painful for the Central American country, with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings were under way, officials of North and Central America have raised a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity, as a follow-up to a corresponding concentration that took place last year, which was considered as a step forward in the efforts to prevent the transition of refugees to the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted to proceed with the conference, giving a substantial end to the thoughts of sanctions in El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Penns is going to go to the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the great importance of the concentration for the administration, as the diplomats have said.
All three American envoy returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
The spokesman of the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal consultations, on the condition of anonymity.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an external analyst near the administration, who also spoke under the term of anonymity.
Read History
The next blow may be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller to block justice by Mr Trab, for which very strong evidence has now been published.
It is said that Mr Mueller also turns his investigation into the possibility of collaborating between Mr Trab's electoral campaign and Russia on the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its hands, Mr Trab will be accountable before his body, as he is preparing to reclaim the presidency in the next elections and perhaps at the end of the term of the court.
"if" is a lot and I do not mean that the fall of Mr Trab, not of his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are options to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic to judge the length of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported the Chechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and lost the chance to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The beasts of history turn around such turning points and the unconstructed course of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are now faced with several of these turning points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since he was written in that newspaper that last year he proposed that the president be recorded secretly and considered him inappropriate for the President’s position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the version that the Times adopted is inaccurate.
"How will we answer whether the recently requested investigation by the F.B.I. about Bret Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or is it appointed to the Supreme Court despite the reasonable charges for sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress that will put Mr Trab accountant?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But because of the lesson I took in Prama, I think we won't fail.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime once seized my embassy home.
He survived, migrated to America, and 60 years later he sent me to light up candles of the Hebrew Saturday at that table with the sabbath.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eszan, a senior member at the Brookings Institution, is the president of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Custration of Citizens for Responsibility and ethics in Washington) and the author of the book "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and One Legendary House."
Graham Dorans of Rangers is optimistic about the fight with Rapid Vienna.
Rangers welcomes Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw-up in Spain with Vijareal earlier this month, will give her a lot of chance of a response from the 7th Europa League Group.
A knee injury blocked the middle Graham Dorans to make his first appearance in the season until the match with a score of 2-2 with Vijareal, but he believes that Raygers can use this result as a precarious for greater success.
"It was a good time for us because Vijareal is a good team," said 31-year-old.
"We came to the game believing that we could achieve something and we went out with a certain degree.
Perhaps we could get away at the end, but, in general, it was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were better teams in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another great European night.
Welcome to things, we can take three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have brought a good result to their last game, but, with the world on the platform, I am sure we can put our strength and bring a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and changes in the group itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let's hope that we can put our best now, leave us behind the last season and achieve."
Women lose their sleep because of their fear of pension saving
Despite the fact that the research participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Almost half of Nationwide's research participants said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they have spoken about this matter in their children.
"People want their family to take care of them, but they don't take any initiative to have this conversation," said Holly Snaider, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Start from it.
Speak to your husband and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counsel and family to discuss where and how you will receive care as these options may be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial counselor: Your counselor can also help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your long-term long-term care financial options can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance at a redemption price to help you cover these costs or autosecurity with your own property - as long as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal disputes.
Make a health care expert in order to designate a trusted person to supervise your medical care and to ensure that healthcare professionals comply with your wishes if you are not able to contact.
Also, consider whether you can make a payout for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person to make decisions on financial matters on your behalf and to ensure that your accounts are paid in case you become helpless.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an extraordinary health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Provide these details to a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the economics, but who are the doctors?" Martin was asked.
"Who's the medicine?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Make sure you prepare this plan."
Man received multiple fire with a gun in Ilfracomp.
A man received multiple fires with a gun as he was walking home last night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in Oxford Grove, Ilfracomb District in Devon County, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
The police described the incident, which took place at 02:30 British Daytime, as a "success."
The victim didn't see the perpetrator of the attack.
The wounds he suffered are not threatening for his life and the police call for witnesses.
earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Palu Indian city on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications to be interrupted, humanitarian aid forces have not been able to obtain information from Dogala, a region in the north of Palau, which is closer to the centre of the 7.5-degree earthquake of the Richter scale.
In the Palace more than 16,000 people were removed after the break-up of the disaster.
Here are some important elements concerning Pale and Dogala, on the island of Sulauezi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulausezi, located at the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulauezi, with an estimated population of 379.800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Dogala is a reunion that extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline to the southwest of the island of Sulausezi.
The anti-basics, a grade of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main segments of the central Sulauezi economy, particularly in the Dogala seaside region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is found more in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulausezi.
Palu and Dogala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disasters Control Service.
In 1938 a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dogala.
Tsunami also hit West Dogala in 1996, causing the death of nine people.
Indonesia is within the seismic harbor of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunami are the following:
2004: A great earthquake on the west coast of Acheh Province of Indonesia in northern Sumadra on December 26 caused tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, while over half of them were in Achech.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumadra at the end of May and early April.
Hundreds of dead in the Island of Neia, near the coast of Sumadra.
2006: Rhochter scale earthquake hit the southern part of Java, the most crowded island of Indonesia, causing tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Rhochter scale earthquake with a focus close to the city of Pantang, the capital of the province of West Swamad.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: Rhochter scale earthquake hit one of the Medeui islands, near Swamada, causing a ten-mile tsunami, which destroyed dozens of villages and cost life to about 300 people.
2016: Low focal depth earthquake hit Pidi Jaya area in Acech, causing destruction and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the destruction of the killing earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami was caused this time, but over 100 people were killed by buildings that fell.
2018: Great earthquakes affected the tourist island Lobok in Indonesia, killing over 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's first-born son was arrested for domestic violence
Trak Palin, former Governor of Alaska and candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin, was arrested for attack.
29-year-old Palin, by Gusila of Alaska, was arrested as suspect of domestic violence, obstructing a complaint for domestic violence and resistance against the principle, according to the report published on Saturday by police (Alaska State Troopers).
According to the police report, when a known woman attempted to call the police to denounce the crimes she allegedly committed, she grabbed her phone from the hands.
Peelin is temporarily held at the Mat-Su temporary detention store, with a guarantee of $500, as mentioned in the KTUU TV station.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he said "sure, innocent" when he was asked, as the network says.
Peelin's facing charges for three class A deportations, which means that he can be sentenced to up to one year and a $250,000 penalty.
He is also accused of a category A flood, punished with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal prosecution against Peelin is committed.
In December 2017 he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to denounce the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Court of Veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, charges for domestic violence were imposed, preventing a complaint about the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of a weapon, while in the state of drunkenness.
His partner claimed that he was in the face.
Sarah Palin was critically criticised by veterans in 2016 when she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit by the Sulauez island in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake in the Richter scale caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks have been interrupted, while the number of dead is expected to increase in the next few days.
The earthquake hit near the central Sulauezi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.

Federal prosecutors ask for the rarely imposing death penalty for the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the imposition of death penalty to Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York, costing life to eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, allegedly used a company's rental truck Home Depot to attack a cycling route along the West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, dragging pedestrians and cyclists on its way on October 31st.
In order to justify condemnation to death, prosecutors should prove that Shaipov killed the eight victims "in intentional" and caused heavy physical damage "with intentions", according to the statement of intention to impose the death penalty, lodged at the Court of South York District.
Both of these charges survive the death penalty, according to the document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury brought Saipov to face with the 22-point class charge, which included eight categories of homicide in favour of criminal organization, a tactic often applied by federal prosecutors in organised crime cases and a charge for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "significant design and premeditation" said the prosecutors, describing the way Shaipov was attacked as "aτρό, hard and inappropriate."
"Simovylo Habibolavic Saipovic caused pain, harm and losses to the families and friends of the Diego Enrique Anchelini, Nicholas Clives, An-Lord, Daren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Erik, Ernan Ferguchi, Ernan Diengo Mentosa and Alchandro Damian Panouko, as stated in the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Court of Justice of the Southern District of New York has been prosecuting a case that inflicts the death penalty.
The defendant, Halid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but finally imposed his life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was imposed on a federal case in New York, it was 1953 to the wives of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being conspiratory about spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbekistan national, appeared unrepentant in the days and months following the attack, according to judicial documents.
He told the interrogators he was satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to perform the attack by ISIS video that he saw on his phone according to the indictment.
He also asked to establish ISIS's flag in his hospital room, according to the police.
He declared himself innocent for the 22 counts appearing in the indictment.
David Paton, one of the federal public lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "expressably disappointed" by the decision of the prosecution authority.
"We believe that the decision to demand the imposition of a death penalty instead of acceptance of the declaration of guilt for life imprisonment with no chance of detoxification will simply extend the trauma caused by the events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutors not to demand the imposition of a death penalty.
Voice Member of the Torice says that Natzel LRATZ should be led by the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Faraj has vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest gathering at the Toris conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said that politicians had to "press the pressure" by the Eurosceptics, as one of the Teresa May Members said that he should be head of the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Member Peter Boone told protesters in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would already be out of it until now if Mr Faraj was the minister responsible for Brexit.
But the challenge faced by Mrs Mai in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided Members was highlighted by the fact that defenders of residence in the EU Toris participated in a separate protest gathering against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep the Chackers compromise plan under control through attacks by Brexit defenders in favour of staying in the EU and the EU.
The allies insisted on going ahead with its attempt to reach agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and the 'haos'.
Mr. Boone told the protest gathering Leave Means Leave (departure means withdrawal) in Solihall that he wanted to fly "the Chekers Plan".
He said that a noble title had been awarded to Mr Faraj and that he had been granted powers for negotiations with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we would have already left now," he said.
The Member from Wellingborough added: "I will support the Brexit, but we need to throw out the Cheers Plan."
In expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to become subordinates.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Boone rejected the allegations that public opinion had been changed from the 2016 vote: "The assumption that the British people have changed their mind and wants to stay is completely incurable."
The champion of the Brexit Member of Torris Andrea Jenkins was also in the protest and told journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The Chekers Plan does not have the acceptance of the general public, the Republika will not vote for it, it does not have the acceptance of our party and our activists who go down the streets and at the bottom of us are elected.
Please leave the Checkers plan and start listening."
With a sharp message to Mrs May, she added: "The prime ministers hold their jobs when they keep their promises."
Mr Faraj said at the protest gathering that politicians should be forced to "pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision taken by the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the order of our policies," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them, "We won't let you get away with it if you do that."
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make the order of our policies ready to betray Brexit, to feel the pressure.
"We are imagining the popular army of this country that gave us victory with Brexit and we will never be quiet until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, EU residents' champions were protesting in Bermigham before a two-hour gathering in the city center.
Few activists raised Torice banners against Brexit after the group concentration this weekend.
The Member of the Labour Lord Adonos has mocked the Conservatives because of the security issues they faced with with a party's implementation at the start of the conference.
"These are the same people who tell us that information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-Chinese type agreement can operate, with enrichment, for the unforeseen border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a perfect fiasco.
Not meant good Brexit" added.
Warren plans to seriously consider whether to put a candidate for the Presidency
The American Senator Elizabeth Warren declares that she will seriously examine whether she can run for the presidency after the November elections.
The newspaper Boston Globe reports that the senator of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about its future plans during a concentration at a city hall in the Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trab, claims to be re-elected in November, with an opponent of the Republican state representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired the Trab campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is strongly believed that it can be measured with Trab in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters using the structures of the mayor since the start of Trab's term.
A congressor asked her if he plans to run for the presidency.
Warren answered that it's time to go to Washington women to build our broken government, and that means a woman must be at the top.
Arrest for the lethal shot of LSU Sims basketball
Police in Baton Rouz, Los Angeles announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect for the deadly shooting of the LSU Wide Sims basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Deton Simpson, 20, in a press conference at 11pm.
They had published a video of shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared in the video.
20-year-old Sims was shot deadly near the South University University site early Friday.
"Wide Sims was wounded by a bullet in his head, leading to his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul said in the media on Saturday, according to the 247sports website network.
Wade went to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson questioned himself and admitted that he was in his possession of a gun, and he confessed that he shot Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without resisting and being held in the Police Department of the East Baton Rouge district.
The three-year student Sims with a height of 1,98, who grew up in Baton Rouge in 32 matches, with 10 appearances as a key player during the last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5,6 points and 2,9 rebund per match.
Grand Prince of Russia: Lewis Hamilton goes for a global title, as the team's instructions handed him the victory over Sebastian Fetel
It became clear from the moment Valerie Bota passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes's orders would play an important role in the race.
At the beginning, Bota had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position at the first two turns and invited Felel to attack his console.
Fatell went first to the pits and let Hamilton run into the race line, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pits after a round and came back from Felel, but Hamilton went out in front of a wheel wheel battle, which forced Ferrari's driver to unwillingly abandon the internal cause of danger of falling into the double drive to defend the third corner.
Max Ferstapen began in the last place and was seventh at the end of the first round of his 21-year-old generations.
He then remained first for a large part of the race, as he kept his tires aiming to end fast and pass in front of Kimmy Rajonen in the fourth place.
Finally he went to the bottom in the 44th round, but he couldn't increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, as Rajonen came fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valerie was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did excellent and did one or two," Hamilton said.
The body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump was mocking Senator Diane Finstein at a conference Saturday about her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blazi Ford's letter, in which she blamed the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanano for sexual assault.
Speaking at a concentration in West Virginia, the president did not mention directly the statement that Ford gave before the senate Justice Committee, commenting instead that the evidence in the Senate showed that people are "oppressive and terrible and liar."
"The only thing that could happen and this beautiful thing that's happening in the past few days in the Senate, where you see the anger, you see people who are angry and malignant and lousy and liars," he said.
"When you see publications and leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer, you leaked the document "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't run it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't break up," she said imitating the Senator.
Finstein received Ford's letter containing details of the charges against Cavanaugh in July and she went through earlier in September - but Finstein refused that the leak was made from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't run through her story," Phenstein said to the committee, as mentioned in the Hill newspaper.
"He asked me to keep her secret, and I kept her undercover as he asked me."
But its refusal did not seem to be particularly convinced by the president, who commented during the weekend gathering: "I will tell you something, the body language was very bad.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the President made it clear that the Democrats are using the charges to serve their own purposes.
"They are determined to take power back by using any necessary means.
You see maliciousness, sport, they don't care who they are hurt, who they have to walk to take power and control," the president said according to Mediaite news website.

Air traffic controller loses his life to save hundreds of air passengers from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being declared a hero, as he lost his life in his attempt to ensure safe take-off of an aeroplane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many were ignored because of a large earthquake hit by the island of Sulauseze on Friday, causing tsunami.
Powerful postures continue to hurt the area and many have been trapped in rubbles in the city of Patu.
But even though his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Gwnawan Agkung refused to leave his position in the control tower that was being shaken, at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport of Paul.
He stayed in his place to make sure that the flight 6321 of the Batik Air airline, which was in the take-off corridor at that time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation spokesman Indonesia, Johannes Shiret, said that this decision could save hundreds of lives, as Australia's ABC News broadcast.
We prepared a helicopter from Balipapan to Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the chopper arrived at the Palace.
"We're shocked with his death," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the dead may be thousands, while the country's disaster management service says that access to Dogala, Sigi and Botong cities is limited.
"The number of dead believes that it will grow further, as many bodies are still under ruins, while many of them have not been able to reach them," said the service representative Sutopo Pulgo Nugroy.
Waves that reached six meters destroyed Paul, which will hold a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and supplies.
Riza Kuzuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, some ambulance brings bodies.
The clean water is short.
The minimarkets are looting everywhere."
Jean Gelfad, chairman of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to save survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Uidondo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I ask you to work a night to get through every evacuation-related work.
Are you ready? Did you turn the CNN?
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, costing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says that a man is missing after the crash of aircraft in a lake
The airline that carried out a flight that crashed into a Pacific pond in Micronesia now reports that a man is missing, while earlier he said that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinked aircraft.
Air Niugini in a press release said that Saturday afternoon is not able to find the traces of a passenger man.
The airline said he worked with the local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as its age or nationality.
Boats of the area helped save the other passengers and crew members after the plane impact on the water as he was trying to land at the airport of the Cook Islands.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday and the situation of all of them was stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane was buried in the lagoon outside the landing corridor.
Some witnesses thought the plane went through the landing corridor.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down very low.
"That's great," Janes said.
Janes said that he and others managed to move through the water that got them to the middle of the emergency escape exits of the sinked airplane.
He said the air escorts had been paniced and shouted and himself suffered a slight injury to the head.
The U.S. Navy reported that some sailors who worked there close to improving a dock also helped rescue using a fountain boat to carry people on the coast before sinking the ship about 30 meters (100 feet).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in conflicts of air companies registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but in none of these conflicts Air Niugini was involved.
Analyst quotes the timeline of the night at which a woman burned alive
The accused authority completed her fight on Saturday in the resumption trial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlet testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to set up the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinn Telice and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Roullet said that he received location files from various mobile phones that showed that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, discrediting his previous claims, as Clarion Ledger said.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers' phone the time he claimed he was with Michael Sanford's friend, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he wasn't in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him whether Telis was telling the truth he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "He was lying because my truck was in Nassail."
Another contradiction was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile records showed that they only knew a week.
Roullet said that sometime after Chambers died, Telis erased Chambers' messages, calls and contact details from his phone.
"He deleted it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is about to start her fight on Sunday.
The judge said that later that day the trial will be brought to the jury's judgment.

Another black guy? !
Danny in New York sue a couple who fired her after receiving a "radio" message.
A nanny from New York is indicted to a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a message that the mother accidentally sent her, where she complained that the nanny was "a different black man."
The couple refuses to be racists, like blackmail treatment.
Lindsay Platco-Flaxman, a mother of two children, was disappointed when she saw that the new nanny Giselle Morris was black, just the last one appeared for her first day at work in 2016.
"OHIIIIIIIIIIIIIII A OTHER MAYOS" wrote Mrs. Platsco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris and even twice.
As soon as she realized her glove, the poor Mrs. Platos-Flaxman has unleashed Mrs. Morris, stating that their passing nanny, which was Aphromerica, had done no good work and was waiting for a Filipinoza, according to New York Post.
Mrs Morris received a reward for her one and only working day and then sent her home with Uber.
Now, Mrs Morris has filed a claim against the couple asking for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for $ 350 a day for the six-month period of work as an internal nanny, for which she had initially been hired, although without a contract.
"I want to show them that, look, you can't do such things," he told Post on Friday, while he added, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple contradicts the claims that they are racists, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris as they were afraid they couldn't trust her again after they offended her.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," the husband Joel Platco told Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had insulted, even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on now."
By simulating the treatment with extortion, Platco said his wife had only been born two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Would you be chasing someone who's in this situation?
It's not so kind," the bank investor added.
While the legal case is under way, the public court has tried to condemn the couple in the social media, judging them for their behavior and logic.
Pandington's editors feared that readers would not be interested in a talk bear, as it reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born just after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It's hard to get into the position of someone who first read it before it was adopted.
It's a lot of fun when you know what we now know about the enormous success of Padington."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC screenwriter before he was inspired to write the children's book from a laurious bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "sweetful", as her father left last year.
About Paddington, who describes as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was secretly proud of his later success.
"He was a fairly quiet man and he wasn't a superb man," he said.
"But because Paddington was so real in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of it even if it's not your fault in reality.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave credit to Padington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was transported directly to the Hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors were in vain trying to save her life.
"Nat always called and told me it was too bad, that she didn't have much hope of doing it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperuz.
"Any time, Nad called me to tell me he'd die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Cassie, I love you so much, darling.
I'll come near you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that doctors had given to her to keep her heart alive were slowly reduced and they came out of her body.
He had already died a little while ago and at that time, and now it's all gone away.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was all going on.
I couldn't scream, shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay calm."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperuz, who was so far mourning about her daughter's loss, was boarded on the plane along with the other passengers who ignored the trial she passed.
"No one knew it," he said.
"I had my head down, and tears were running all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I got a feeling of sympathy to Nad.
That she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved her."
Women in mourning the loss of their own people hang cards on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost their favorite suicides try to prevent other people from taking away their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang on a gullet bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that one can call to receive support.
Her son, Mrs. Davis, Tyler, was 13 years old when she started suffering from depression and killed herself at age 18.
"I don't want a parent to feel like I feel every day," he said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him thanks to his smile.
They always said that his smile was making the room."
However, he left his job before he died as he was in a very bad situation.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had put an end to his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm worried that there will be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there who you can go and talk, even if they are your friends.
Don't stay silent - you must speak."
Mrs. Humphrey, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, just after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt frustrated or sad or something," he said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had caught a bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes."
He said his death caused them a huge wound, but they must overcome it: "He dissolves the family.
It's crashing us.
But we all have to continue and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins an investigation.
"I thought that if we could actually achieve something like what it was asking for - a research of limited duration and limited object - perhaps we could bring a little unity," Mr Fleik said on Saturday, while he added that he was afraid that the committee would be dissolved in through frozen party unexplained.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
The interim elections are in only five weeks, 6 November, and if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, they will weaken significantly as regards their efforts to achieve the election of the person they want in the country's highest court.
George Walker Bush calls senators, pushing them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report was presented?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which is currently made by 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can take at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Penns, the Vice-President, to take the majority and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean Rebels falls under the authority of Kim
The number of rebels from North Korea to South Korea has been reduced since Kim Young Eun came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean legislator.
Park Hiong-seug, providing data from the South Korean Integration Ministry, said that there were 1,127 missions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher charges for migrants were key factors.
Pennyang has not made public comments.
The vast majority of rebels from North Korea is finally being offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul reports that over 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are escaped through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross them compared to the heavily protected Destruction Zone between North and South Korea.
China thinks rebels of illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often deports them through violence.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are typically still in war, have improved appreciably over recent months.
Earlier in the month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pinjiang to talk about the denuclearisation negotiations that have been delayed.
This meeting came after the historic meeting between American President Donald Trab and Kim Young Oyn in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to work together to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday North Korea's Foreign Minister Rim Jung Ill accused US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances, we will never disarm our country alone first," said Mr. Reim in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelozi calls Brett Kavanaugh "Usteric", says she's inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
The Democratic President of the Chamber of Representatives Nancy Pelozi called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "Usterian" and said he was inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
Peloise made these comments at an interview Saturday at Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted in this way, they would call it "weak" Peloise commented on Kavanaugh's statement in front of the Senate's Committee on Judiciary Affairs on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, with strong emotion, denied the accusations that she had committed sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blazzi Ford when both teenagers were.
During his opening scout, Kavanaugh was deeply touched, sometimes he was yelling and his voice was running as he was talking about his family and his school years.
He also utterly sentenced the Democrats to the committee, characterizing the charges against him as a "street and coordinated murder policy", organised by liberals who have angry with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the presidential elections in 2016.
Pelozi said that he believes that Kavan's testimony has shown that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, as he has shown that he is prejudicial to the Democrats.
"I think he turned himself away with these statements and the way he made against Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelozi reacted when she was asked if she would try to express censure against Kavanum if his appointment were confirmed and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - unless he tells the truth to Congress or the FBI, then not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which she is serving at the moment," Peloise said.
Kavanaugh is a judge at the Regional Court of the Cologne Region (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelozi added that as a Democrats he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions on the Adaptation Act, or in the Roy v. Wade case, as it is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm his appointment, Kavanaugh refrained from answering questions if he would overthrow some rulings from the Supreme Court.
"Isn't it time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and wait to say, "It's not wonderful?" Peloise said.
And women must have it in their possession.
It's a justified outbreak, months and years of wrath, it's overflowing and can't get it out of it without crying.
"We were crying when we were angry" Mrs. Steicem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I was very helpful to me by a woman who was a clerk somewhere, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she had developed a technique that when she was angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You might think I was sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
So he just kept going.
And it seemed excellent."
The tears are allowed as a rage outbreak partly because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my greatest memories of a job I have done before, in a office where men were dominated, is once I cried with inconceivable wrath and grabbed me from the neck a older woman - a cold principal that I've always been slightly afraid of - and pulled me into a ladder.
"Don't ever let them see you crying" she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they broke you."
Patricia Strander, then a Democratic Senator from Colorado, had collaborated with Garry Hart in his presidency campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught to have concluded an extrajudicial relationship with a ship called Monkey Business (Brody Work) and abandoned the struggle humiliated, Mrs Srender, deeply disappointed, she thought there was no reason to consider the idea that she would put the same candidate for the Presidency.
"It wasn't such a wise decision," he said, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already another seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow White and the seven dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already begun for a long time, it was back in funding and he swore that he would not enter the election race if he hadn't collected 2 million dollars.
The battle was lost.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men, only paid $250 to her.
"Do they think I have a discount?" She was wondering.
In her speech when she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she was very strongly charged with emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made money so difficult and targeted voters instead of representatives and anger with sexism - who felt knot in the neck.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown," Mrs. Srender remembers about the press's reactions against her.
"You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write in my graveplane?
Did he cry?
How the trade war between the United States and China can do good in Beijing
The greeting counterparts of the trade war between the United States and China were deaf and while the battle still has a long way to finish, a break between the two countries may benefit from Beijing in the long term, the experts say.
American President Donald Trab threw the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing basic Chinese exporting products, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The biggest escalation has evolved this week by imposing new tariffs on types of US$200 million (150 million UKL) in fact with hate tax from all products imported into the USA from China.
Beijing returns fire every time in kind, and recently imposed duties of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to return the US fires and the world's second largest economy is not likely to put it down soon.
In order to make Washington retreat will have to stick to their demands, but to publicly worship in the United States would be too embarrassing for Si Jinpining, the president of China.
However, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards properly, American pressures in the course of the trade war could be positive for China in the long term by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision either in Washington or in Beijing could create conditions for economic collapse in any of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than the observers have admitted in the past," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia's study centre, at the Center for New American Security (Centre for a New American Security), a thought tank.
Syria is "year" to return refugees, according to Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for aid for the reconstruction of the country's war over seven years (and now).
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al Muamle said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and safe because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore regularity.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihood.
The UN considers that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since 2011 when the war broke out.
Other six million people still in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al Mulem said that aid for reconstruction of the damaged country is welcome to the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that it would not receive conditional aid or aid from countries supporting the uprising.

The American team has now lost 6 times on European territory and has won the Rider Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe has taken the first place again, as the Danish leader Thomas Bjoorn's team reached the 4.5 degrees needed to defeat the United States.
The US team's star Phil Mykelston, who fought hard during the biggest tournament, threw his shot into the water in the par-3 16th hole, granting the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian player of golf Molinari shattered all his rounds and so became 1 of the 4 players who achieved 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spith was defeated on 5&4 from the lowest in the European team's ranking, Danish Thorborne Olsen.
The player with the best ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson, achieved 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who could play his last game in a Rider Cup.
Spanish veteran eight Cups Raider, Sergio Garcia was crowned the most victorious European of all time in the tournament with a total of 25,5 grades.
"I usually don't cry, but today I can't hold on.
It was a difficult year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy we took the cup back.
It's all about the team and I'm glad I could help," Garcia was moved after the European victory.
It gives the spy to John Ram's compatriot, who defeated the U.S. golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I feel unbelievable pride I beat Tyler Woods, I grew up admiring this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a career record at Ryder 13-21-3 Cup.
Unusual statistics on one of the biggest players of all time, who has conquered 14 important titles and has only passed Jack Niclaus.
The U.S. team made it difficult for all weekends to find a target, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Fino, who played a high level of golf in the whole tournament.
American leader Jim Farrick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
Some moments this morning we pushed Europe enough.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a big leader.
All his 12 players played very well.
We will reconstruct, cooperate with the US PGA and the Rider Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 children and I'm proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us."
