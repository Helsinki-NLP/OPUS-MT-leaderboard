Welsh Parliamentary Deputies (AM) worried about ‘looking like puppets’
There was some concern by some members of the National Assembly regarding the change of their title to MWP.
The issue was raised by plans to change the name of parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of Congress at the assembly worried that this might be a matter of mixed opinion.
A Labour Party delegate said his party was worried that "the phrase would rhyme with Twp and Pwp."
For non-Wales native readers: In Wales, twp means temporary and pwp means stool.
A plaid party representative stated that the entire party was “not proud” and suggested other names.
A Conservative Party delegate said his party had "no prejudices" about changing its name, but did not forget to mention how easily MWP abbreviated as Muppet.
The Welsh w is pronounced similar to the English Yorkshire u.
The Congressional Committee is currently drafting a bill regarding the name change, stating: “The final decision on any identification of the members of the National Assembly will naturally be of interest to the delegates themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Parliament the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a referendum on proposals to find a consensus basis for the naming of parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
Considering the story of the titles of the Parliamentarians, the Committee favored the Welsh Parliamentarians or the WMP, the referendum results showed a bias towards the Welsh Parliamentarians.
Congressional deputies are openly offering other options, but efforts to reach consensus could be a concern for the election chief, Elin Jones, who is tasked with submitting a draft amendment in the coming weeks.
The draft amendment will include other changes to the way parliament operates, including regulations governing the removal of the National Assembly and the design of the government apparatus.
Members of Congress shall give a final vote on the question of what title they should be changed when they give their opinion on the draft amendment.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Voters cast ballots on Sunday over whether they would change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The comprehensive vote was set up in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long asserted that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has repeatedly opposed becoming a member of the EU and NATO of your country.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a member of the opposition to change the country's name, has vowed to repeal the vote.
But proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said the change was the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bell of St. Martin's Church falls into silence as a crisis strikes in Harlem
“Historically, the elders I was contacted with shared that every corner of the street had a bar and a church,” Adams said.
“To this day, there are no churches and no bars.”
He found that the disappearance of the bars was acceptable.
He said that today “man has many ways of communicating.”
“Bars are no longer public lounges where people frequent.”
As for the churches, he worried that the money from the sale of the property would not be as sustainable as the leaders expected "and sooner or later it would all come back at the starting line."
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominiums with many of the apartments of the locals, which would not help in preserving the local sanctuary.
“A small part of the people who buy apartments in those apartment buildings will be white people, and then the prospect of closed churches coming in faster than ever because there is no reason why the residents of those apartments will become lay people here.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a municipality for people of color—the Metropolitan Community in the 1870s, which became St. Martin's a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregations moved away in the 1930s.
A congregation of black worshippers nearby took over the site.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the management of Father John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a shopping mall street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or urging people of color.
A fire in 1939 caused the building to be badly damaged, but when Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they set up bells.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s, proudly calls the bell ringing “the bell of the poor.”
The ringleader in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an immutable historical treasure."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world’s first ringing ring played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who pursued the larger ringing at Riverside Cathedral 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's would not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin’s over the past few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, some given by lay leaders in the church, others by the diocese.
The diocesan administration — the parish’s governing body, composed of lay leaders — mentioned the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese “will seek to transfer costs” to the diocesan administration, although they are not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors mentioned.
Some parishioners are unhappy with the lack of transparency on the diocesan side.
Sharks attack 13-year-old boy scuba diving to catch lobster in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving to catch lobsters in California on Saturday, the first day of the shrimp harvest, authorities said.
It happened before 7 a.m., near the Beacon's coast at Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he was driving with his friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and then all the boats pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was just a shout of pleasure when he caught the shrimp, but "he realized that he was screaming: 'I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
The whole part of the boy’s collarbone was exposed,” Hammel noticed as soon as he reached the boy.
“I tell everyone to get out of the water right away: ‘There are sharks there!’” Hammel added.
The boy was flown by plane to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was insured, in a critical condition.
The shark was the culprit in the unidentified attack.
Rescuers Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that they had spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but they determined it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles further mentioned that the victim suffered severe injuries to his upper body.
Officials closed the beach entrances from the Ponto Sea in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas within 48 hours of giving birth for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles revealed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's strategy to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s is pushing for Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with traditional display pavilions, where there are always helpers.
As part of a massive push into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion beauty market, which is continuing to grow while sales of fashion and home appliances are declining, larger beauty booths will be tested in 11 stores nationwide and replicated in more stores next year if signs are positive.
The investment in the beauty industry comes as supermarkets look for ways to take advantage of alternative stalls for TV counters, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s says it has doubled the size of its beauty products to 3,000 for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Available brand chains such as L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also have additional space and brand sales areas similar to those displayed in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also reinforcing its line of Boutique makeup so that the majority of products are purely plant-based – something that is increasingly hunted by young customers.
Fragrance Shop will be testing discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and shifting to buying small amounts of daily food at local convenience stores means supermarkets have to focus more on attracting customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stalls will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain tries to confront incentives from Aldi and Lidl with more non-food products and services.
Sainsbury’s, which has put Argos’ stalls in hundreds of stores and has also introduced several Habitat’s stalls since they bought both brand chains two years ago, has boosted grocery sales and made acquisitions more lucrative.
The supermarket had previously tried to enhance its beauty and pharmaceutical segments but failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after problems related to how to divide sales from grocery stalls in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold 281 of its pharmaceuticals to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a part in the plan, by strengthening a range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of beauty rows to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specialized training for employees who will directly give advice.
Our wide range of brands are designed to fit every need and charming environment as well as convenient locations means we are now an attractive stopover that challenges the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'outrageous' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones was "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of her <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal in her stylistic brand business to focus on her new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their Truly furniture brand and accessories.
The couple’s business is like Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning’s 37-year-old host took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den, angering star Peter Jones as she pulls out of their super-profitable branding business at the last minute - to focus on her own lucrative new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
At a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, sources said Jones was “angry” when the show’s golden girl admitted that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m – meant she no longer had enough time to devote herself to their brand of Truly furniture and accessories.
The business is likened to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby took to Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left the UK for one of her motels.
A source said: “To date, Truly is Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that could accompany her in the next few decades.
Her decision to leave surprised those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, which was very close to the premiere.
There’s a warehouse full of goods at Marlow’s headquarters ready to roll out.”
Experts believe the departure of host This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions of dollars due to heavy investments in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and interiors, and the possibility of a reversal at the time of product launch.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin became close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple went on vacation together and Jones had a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said: "We will not comment on his business."
It’s a “deeply in love” fight.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from media outlets for making a comment that some would see as "incompetent to be in power" for being positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a voice that echoed “the presenter.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June when Trump hailed it as a major step towards denuclearization in North Korea.
But denuclearization talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Ministry head Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a “satisfactory response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States is continuing sanctions to increase pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his campaign speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We’re going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people could be killed.
We are in a good relationship now.”
He said efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — ending missile tests, freeing the hostages and returning the remains of U.S. service members back home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this cramped area, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia destroy the island and kill hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has gone missing, no national disaster claims have been made, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have been very unequivocal in not asking for international aid, so it’s very challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a group to move to Palu, they are still unsure if foreign employees can work in the area.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies were allowed to contribute aid efforts.
Despite Indonesia’s ongoing earthquakes, the country has yet to be prepared in the face of the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, such places were not common in other locations.
Despite the effective warning, the lack of tsunami warning whistles in Palu has the potential to lead to human damage.
At peak times, moving between many of Indonesia’s islands is a challenge.
Disasters make logistics even more complicated.
An ambulance train has been stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims trying to reach Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia’s old infrastructure a hub of his election campaign and he squandered funds on road and rail construction.
But the financial shortfall has made it difficult for Joko’s administration as he faces re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as members of the Muslim majority pursue a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands washed away from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs scrambled in the streets, using knives, bows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Follow-up: Daniel Sturridge brings a draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat to Chelsea in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London with a goal in the 89th minute.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri 30m away from Chelsea as his team was 1-0 ahead.
He handled the ball with his left foot before launching a shot into the distant pole.
Shoot and head to the top right corner of the goal.
The ball crossed Kepa Arrizabalaga's reach and flew straight into the net.
“I simply stood in the right position, got the ball, and the players, including Shaq, were always trying to get to the top, so I just had to make an effort to get to the top,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante rushing in, so I handled a touch and shot without much hesitation.”
Chelsea lead almost half the game after the opening goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this phase of the ball, the Royal Cavalry striker passes the ball to Mateo Kovacic before moving around the midfield area and rushing to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic had a wall pop from the middle of the pitch.
He had a beautiful slit, heading for Hazard who was rushing into the no-land zone.
Hazard removed the defence and finished with his left foot in the corner of the game, overtaking Liverpool’s Alisson Becker.
The match between Liverpool and Napoli in the Champions League group stage will take place at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Tuesday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami reached 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and waves in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Center said early Sunday.
Numerous people were said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings brought by the 7.5-degree quake on Friday, which led to waves as high as 20 feet, Sutopo spokesman Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is submerged in the rubble of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of stabbing woman
After the discovery of the body of a woman discovered this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, an investigation into the murder has begun.
The 44-year-old victim was discovered at 7.55 a.m. at Grayson Mews, John Street, with stab wounds, after which a 32-year-old male suspect was arrested.
Police called on locals if they saw or heard anything, to report it.
Detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its first phase but I call on anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead, if you've seen or heard anything suspicious, to notify us.
“I also call on anyone, especially the drivers, if they have unwittingly saved anything from the angles of the journey to contact us as they can obtain important information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman identified the woman as a local resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the home.
This afternoon, some people were told they had sex with the woman who had gone to the scene to testify about where the victim had been in the morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police say they are in the process of notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to return home, but police said no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
He didn’t say anything when he found out about it.
Residents were told it would take several hours until they were allowed to return.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
An emotional woman arrived at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s terrible.”
At two o'clock in addition to the police cars in the blockade area, there was another car outside.
A lot of police are inside the blockade area watching the apartment.
Anyone with information please contact DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crime Prevention at 0800 555 111 24/7 from 30 September.
Congressional statue of Cromwell becomes the latest monument to ‘rewrite history’
The extermination would be like a trail of justice for the Taliban's destruction of many Puritans who followed him, as they destroyed countless British structures and religions.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s words as “crazy” and “attempts to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It is inevitable that debate over the abandonment of Oliver Cromwell’s statues outside Westminster Palace will be at the center of the debate.
Symbols of the British Civil War were not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell’s wrong will be replaced by his father Thomas in the last century.
Cromwell's representative, Sir William Hamo Thassycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of the history of a figure that many believe still deserves to be honored.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Perhaps by the end of the 19th century it will be more than it is now, Cromwell is seen by many as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his position, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it’s a perfectly accurate example of the subject in the ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict between the 17th century shaped the next development of our country and Cromwell was a typical figure in the divide.
His achievements as a protector of the Lord are also worthy of honor and recognition.”
Pig Killer Attacks Chinese Farmers
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, known as “Yuan”, was found dead with a broken, bloody artery near a barn in a market in Lupun Thuy, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Tay Ninh, Qinghai province, China.
He is believed to have moved with his cousin from nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out he was dead, and saw a door of a pighouse next to it open.
He said in the cage was a large boar with blood stains around the snout.
Reports of a forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs are bloody and not intact,” his cousin, known as “Wu”, told Guiyang Evening News.
Security footage showed Yuan arriving at the market around 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, he was found dead.
The killer pig is not a pig in the pigs of two brothers.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market’s regulator are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although not common, cases of pigs attacking people have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, injuring the husband.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer into his tractor until his wife threatened the animal to flee.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the smell of blood can act as a “teacher.”
“They just want to be close.
“They’re reserved, they’re very curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to be nice to them,” he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa carry heavy rain across the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it is en route to the colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will carry torrential rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa has winds of 85 mph, Typhoon Level 1, as of 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure began to form over the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward to the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approached the Baja California Peninsula on Monday when forming a tropical storm, it would begin to carry much of the North's humid temperatures into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, wet temperatures encountering low pressure will cause widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause dangerous flash floods, debris streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Humid temperatures will cause rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour at major sites, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected to reach between 2 and 4 inches in southwestern areas, especially on a large area of Arizona.
Floods can occur when the situation deteriorates rapidly due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
The situation will be extremely difficult if you venture to walk into the desert when there is a threat from tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into violent rivers and thunderstorms will carry local gusts and dust cyclones.
Low pressure will carry some local heavy rains many places on the Southern California coast.
Total precipitation can reach more than half an inch, easily causing debris streams and slippery roads.
This will be the region’s first rainy season.
A number of scattered tropical rains began pouring into Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain became more common late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Some extreme temperatures can be seen across the United States in October as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to significant changes in temperature at localities close to each other.
A typical wallet of significant temperature disparities in the central U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference is close to 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the warmth of summer will be renewed and strengthened again.
Much of the U.S. central and eastern regions are expected to have a warm start in October with temperatures common in about 80 in the Southern Plains to the northeast.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees higher on average.
Long-term weather forecasts are showing the possibility that temperatures will be above average in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched Thursday’s hearing on six television networks of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continues, with television stations disrupting regular broadcasts with last-minute splashing news on Friday: an agreement made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a calm move, said he was 100 percent certain that it didn’t happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing, Nielsen pointed out in the report on Friday.
The company calculated the average number of viewers on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures are not immediately included for other broadcasters including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has a number of problems when it comes to calculating the viewer in the office.
In order to define correlations, the number of spectators is similar to that of a final ticket match or the Oscars.
Fox News, who has given strong support for Kavanaugh’s appointment, has led all stations with an average rating of 5.69 million viewers in the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There is still a lot of concern after the hearing.
Flake is the central figure in the Friday noise.
After the Republican moderate announced he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was tracked by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning that he was shouted by protesters as he tried to follow the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes when questioned, televised live on CNN.
“I’m standing in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the whole country?”
He was condemned as saying, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said before the elevator closed that his office had issued a statement, that he would have much to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television stations will be broadcast hours later, when the Judiciary Committee will have to vote on whether Brett Kavanaugh will be nominated.
But Flake says he will only do so knowing that the FBI will review the allegations against the candidate next week, which some in the minority Democratic Party have urged.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his colleague, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was heavy, as it was clear that the Republican Party would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May Rejects 'Political Debate' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May dismissed criticism of her plan to leave the European Union as a "political discourse" on Britain's future and undermined the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Meeting in Birmingham, England, September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, former Secretary of State Boris Johnson highlighted his counterattack on their so-called Chequers deal on Brexit, saying the UK and EU proposals to collect each other’s tariffs were “absolutely absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspect for LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting case of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who plays for LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on second-degree murder charges, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had fallen off his glasses during a clash.
Police discovered the glasses from the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS's WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
The bail was set to be worth $350,000, the lawyer said.
The Baton Rouge Regional Autopsy Office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a bullet wound from head to neck.
The department is relying on Louisiana police, anti-evasion task force, state police crime labs, Southern University police and regional residents to assist in the investigation.
LSU’s physical director Joe Alleva thanked the regional legal authority for its “vigorousness and pursuit of justice.”
Sims is only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-old striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
On average he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 hits per game in the previous season.
On Friday morning, basketball coach LSU Will Wade said the team had been “disappeared” and “painted” by Wayde’s death.
Wade said, “That’s what you’ll always have to watch.”
Volcanic ash rushes into Mexico City
The ash spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano has flowed to neighborhoods south of the Mexican capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater was active and they recorded 183 emissions and ash within 24 hours.
The center has been monitoring many fluctuations and shakings.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash that obscured the layers of vehicle windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The "Don Goyo" volcano has been in operation since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, as thousands of protesters took part in the rally marking the first anniversary of a vote on both sides of Catalonia over secession.
A group of masked separatists are held back by riot police with eggs and powder paint, causing clouds of black dust on streets that are often crowded with tourists.
The chaos broke out at the end of the day when police used batons to suppress the fight.
For hours, pro-independence supporters chanted “Do not forget, do not forgive” to confront protesters who opposed the words, “Great Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region following independence a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal for Madrid but well received by Catalan separatists.
Independent voters are overwhelmingly dominant, although support rates are low with the majority anti-separatists boycotting elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region amid intense clashes.
Supporters of independence camped through Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The protest took place first but was forced to take place with other developments.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended a separatist rally with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia’s prospects for independence.
“Last year we had the happiest moments.
I watched my parents cry over the joy of being able to vote but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although Catalan pro-independence pro-independence factions won the regional elections in December last year, they struggled to stay motivated this year with many of their best-known leaders either being quarantined or detained on trial for their role in organizing a referendum to declare independence afterwards.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who returned to a pro-police rally on her phone, said the conflict had been put down by politicians on both sides.
“The story is getting more stressful,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison before trial since late last year, announced he would run for office in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Joining as a candidate for the European election is the best way to denounce a fall in the democratic and repressive values we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested as Car Crash into Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car repeatedly drove into a Londonderry home.
The incident happened at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 BST.
Police investigating Bob Blemmings said the incident caused damage to the gates and the building itself.

Menga's shot brings a 1-0 win for Livingston over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s lead makes Livingston sure to win
Livingston is up to surprise Rangers as this Ibrox home team is led by Steven Gerrard with only two losses in 18 games.
Dolly Menga’s scoring proved different when Gary Holt’s side raised Hibernian in seconds.
Gerrard's side have yet to score a separate goal in the Premier League this season and face the leaders of the Hearts, who lead eight points, on Sunday.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended his unbeaten streak in six games, as head coach Holt has also tasted defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to play against the undersea side
Holt’s team should have been ahead before they scored, with their direct tactics making Rangers difficult.
Scott Robinson struggled but surpassed the goal, after which Alan Lithgow was only able to direct his efforts more aggressively after leading the ball to Craig Halkett across the field.
The hosts confidently let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they can cause trouble to the visitors with personal techniques.
And that's the strategy for the set score.
Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston led, Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinating towards Menga, who made a touchdown and scored in the middle of the game.
At this point, the Rangers were dominant in holding the ball but found the defence impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no difficulty.
The match continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos received help from Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed under the feet of Rangers Allan McGregor and Lithgow transitioned to another Livingston scenario.
The consecutive lead into Livingston’s goal and was repeatedly caught, when there were two penalty kicks – after Halkett’s challenge to Glenn Middleton’s replacement, one because of his touch on the ball – was successfully thwarted.
'Labeling' with Livingston - analysis
from BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A good result and match for Livingston.
The team is excellent, continue to outpace expectations in the upswing.
Their style of play and players have rarely changed since they returned to the top spot, but considerable credit must be given to Holt because of the way he honed the team since he appeared.
You have too many strong players.
Captain Halkett is the overarching, arranging a well-organized defensive line, while Menga constantly retains Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
Just like under Gerrard, they failed to meet those standards.
The last shot was flawed – the only chance of opening the home ground – and it was a wake-up call for Rangers, the mid-table team.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives nuanced reception in Cologne
There were smiles and favorable weather on Saturday (29 September) when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at mending ties between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then moved to Cologne for the inauguration of a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters were also nearby to meet their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters – many of them Kurds – have also condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to the country.
The two extreme protests reflect the split of a guest who was hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and cursed by others as a tyrant.
Dectford crash: cyclist killed in car crash
A cyclist is killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn, a busy neighborhood in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and the paramedic arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The crash came months after another cyclist was killed in a car crash and fled on Childers Road, about a mile from Saturday’s crash.
Police said they were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Roads were blocked and buses were diverted while participants were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in violence
Six employees were injured in a riot in a prison for male inmates with strict security, the prison officer said.
Riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday morning and are still ongoing.
"Tornado" experts were brought to deal with the turbulent war, which ended at around 17:30.
Officers were examined at the scene with minor injuries.
A spokesman for the prison management said: “Specialized training camp personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six injured personnel were treated.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that the individuals involved will be transferred to the police and may spend longer after-shock time.”
The HM Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the nation’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the Prison Superintendent was treated at a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officers were called to prison to deal with a serious rebellion in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Typhoon Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Flooding Passage
Very rarely does tropical depression strike Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week as the energy trails of Hurricane Rosa in the southwestern desert remain, entailing flash flood risks.
The National Meteorological Department released flash flood tracking on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to go in a straight line through Phoenix on Tuesday, but earlier on Monday night there was heavy rain.
The National Meteorological Department in Phoenix mentioned in a short story that only "ten tropical cyclones have formed tropical storms or tropical depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a typhoon within 40 miles of landing on the Arizona border."
The latest forecast models from the latest National Hurricane Center predict precipitation as high as 2 to 4 inches, with segregated flooding levels as high as 6 inches at the Mogollon Belt in Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, including the center of the Rockies and the Great Basin, are likely to be inundated by 1 to 2 inches, with separate levels of flooding that can reach up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not flooded by sudden flooding, the rain from Hurricane Rosa could be a good omen because the region is in drought.
While flooding is a deep concern, some waterfalls can still be happy to welcome because the Southeast is suffering from drought.
According to weather.com, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the lowest level of extreme drought, but is still the second highest in the same category.
First, the Rosa Trail leaves landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still in storm range with a maximum wind speed of 85 miles per hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm hit colder ocean currents in the Pacific and weakened.
Therefore, forecasts suggest that there will be landslides in Mexico when the tropical depression passes by on Monday evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico could be significant, signaling the possibility of flooding.
According to Weather.com, "The total estimated rainfall of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora, could be up to 10 inches."
Rosa will head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday in the form of a tropical depression, which will then sweep through Arizona and make landfall in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main predicted danger from Rosa or its remnants is very high rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening flooding in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Intentional Murder Suspects Arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found stabbed in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m.
You were taken to the hospital in a "stable" state.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
Officers have urged everyone, if they can keep any footage of the incident, to report it.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffers Selfishness, Anger' From Democrats
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the Democrats’ ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has endured the selfishness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his candidacy.
Kavanaugh confronted Congress on Thursday, strongly denying an allegation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades before they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her allegations.
The president said Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's excellence and qualities and courage" that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm that one of the most brilliant legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a genuine public service resume,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president addressed the details of Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy when he spoke about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections in life.
I'm not running, I'm running." He shared.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump said Democrats want to be “contained and obstructed.”
“The first core procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday,” a senior Republican leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia, damage continues to rise
At least 384 people have been killed, many washed away as huge waves hit beaches, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves as high as six meters (18 feet) hit the shore at dusk, sweeping many dead and wreaking havoc on everything in its path.
The tsunami followed a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still engaged in their activities on the beach and didn’t leave immediately and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the National Disaster Protection Agency (BNPB) said in a Jakarta news release.
“The tsunami didn’t come by itself, it dragged cars, wood, houses, sweeping through everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through open waters at 800 kph (497 mph) before landing on the coast.
Some climb trees to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
Some 16,700 people have been evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Airborne photos released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque submerged in water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes have been observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Technology Appraisal and Applications Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy source launched by Friday's powerful earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that hit Hiroshima during World War II.
The city’s location, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have enhanced the size of the tsunami, according to the announcement.
Nugroho described the damage as "massive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage may not have stopped along the 300-kilometre (190 mi) coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The media is "completely paralyzed with no news" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This has been a tragedy, but the tragedy could be much more terrifying,” they said.
The agency was widely condemned on Saturday for failing to announce that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the wave had arrived over time.
In a non-professional video posted on social media, it was possible to hear a man standing tall screaming panicking for people down the road about the approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, a wall of water spilled onto the shore, sweeping after buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that caused a regional communication break around Palu, which made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has started to cut off cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but displaced people are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city airport has been reopened for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has risen by more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees were in canvasses set up in the office yard, they walked through devastating scenes on the road, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began significant moves at the start of disaster relief tools, some complained that highly skilled foreign aid workers had been prevented from moving to Palu.
Under Indonesia’s rules, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only begin if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government decides, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can be ready with international support but there is no word yet.”
As Monday night falls on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hoping that their loved ones will be a miracle to piece together the murky stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled up from the sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman trapped under the rubble for two days with the body of her mother next door.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has coached two of the missing paraglider players for the Asian Games, which were held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including the British Mandagi, were his students.
“As a veteran of paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel went viral in the paragliding community, he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to rivals in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his message only had a gray instead of two green ones.
“I think that means the messages were not sent,” he said.
The robbers took away $26,750 when the ATM was recharged at Newport in Levee.
According to reports from the Newport Police Department, the robbers took $26,750 from a Brink banker as they were depositing money into an ATM in Newport in Levee.
The driver of the car cleared the ATM in the entertainment district and prepared to hand over more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy reported in the article.
While he was busy, a man "who had come from behind the Brink employee" and took away the bag had to be delivered.
Witnesses have reportedly seen several suspects roaming around the scene, but police have not yet determined the number of people involved in the case.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspect, please contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He tweeted about the change on Saturday: "People have known me as Kanye West before."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for a while and uses the name as the eighth album released in June.
The change came before he appeared on Saturday Night Live, when he was expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He was the show's guest on behalf of singer Ariana Grande when she reported herself "emotional disorder," the show's creator said.
As well as the acronym in his current stage name, West had previously said the word had religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, talking about his album title with broadcaster Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, I’m us.
The transition went from Kanye, which means unique, to Ye—the reflection of the good, the bad, the anxiety, everything.
The album is more than our own reflection.
He is one of the most famous rappers to change his name.
Sean Combs is widely known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he was aiming for Love and Brother Love.
An artist who has worked with West, Jay-Z, is also wondering about whether or not there is a dash and capitalization.
Mexican President Says He Will Not Send Military Against Civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country moves towards celebrating the 50th anniversary of the bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that "never put in the army to oppress the Mexican people."
The military opened fire during a peaceful protest in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at the time as leftist student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has sworn to support Mexican youth by providing monthly grants to learners and opening more public universities for free.
He said that the problem of unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities have led young people to become involved in evils.
The U.S. should double its A.I. aid.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount spent on research in the field, AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said in a statement.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made the announcement about AI, even while the U.S. overall lacked a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling our research budget will be a positive start, as all other countries are lagging far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next huge AI achievement will be made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of “AI Superpower: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face<0x2B><0x2B>.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked at an AI system that beat the highest-ranked U.S. Othello player, followed by an executive at Microsoft Research and a director of Google’s China branch.
Lee approaches previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Advanced Project Research Agency’s Robotics Challenge and cares about when the next competition will take place, to help define the next vision.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government aid, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is calling for all academics to lead; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired bright stars from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. consolidate its AI efforts.
He added: “I think green cards should be automatically granted to PhDs in AI.”
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee added: “China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides aid to those in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation and other government institutions subsidize U.S. researchers, but the quality of research in China is lower.
Earlier this year in the United States, the Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, aimed at interfering with partners from industry and education, and the White House announced the creation of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence Selection.
This month the Advanced Defense Research Projects Steering Agency announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
At the National Science Foundation, they now invest more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law has sought to establish a National Security Council on Artificial Intelligence but has not seen a move for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Macedonians voted in Sunday’s referendum on whether to change its name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece aimed at preventing accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, asserts that the name of its northern neighbor corresponds to its own territory and has vetoed its participation in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opponents of nationalism said the change would undermine the national identity of most Slavs in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign had raised doubts about whether voters would meet a minimum of 50 percent of the demand for the referendum's validity.
The question on the referendum vote read: "Do you agree to become a member of NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said it was a price to pay to pursue membership in institutions such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from Yugoslavia's collapse.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, of Skopje, said: "Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can freely enjoy the patronage of the European Union because it leads to a safer life for all of us."
While members of parliament are not legally bound, they have said they will abide by the results of the vote to make a decision.
The name change would require two-thirds of the vote in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in last year’s parliamentary elections when 66 percent of voters registered to vote.
Voter Gjose Tanevski, 62, of Skopje, said: “I went to vote for my children, because our position is in Europe.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Macedonia's referendum on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small podium and pulling chairs in front of tents set up by people who will boycott the referendum.
Kavadarkov said: “We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join the main road, not through the back door.”
“We are a poor country, but poor for cleanliness.
If they don’t see us as Macedonia, then we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian bond.”
Zaev said NATO membership would bring urgent investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20 percent.
“I believe the majority will agree because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said a "voting" result would be "an affirmation for our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research said between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum – lower than the required vote.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, said 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they gave the vote in favor.
A successful referendum must have a 50 percent vote and one vote.
The failure of the referendum represents the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it took place in May last year.
Follow-up: Sergio Aguero at Manchester City has penetrated the entire Brighton defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence with Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed the class with a score in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker received a pass from the middle of the field when he started to lead the ball.
He slid ahead of three Brighton defenders before breaking into the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four blue shirt players.
He chased one defender before blocking other opponents at the edge of the Brighton goal.
Pass to the left, lead the ball right to Sterling.
The Englishman led his first touch in the penalty area for Aguero, who tossed his right shoe with a shot to knock out Brighton Mathew Ryan from the right of the net.
Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero has some leg injuries."
“We talked about letting him play for 55 or 60 minutes.
It happened.
We were lucky to have him score at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the first advantage to the blue shirt players in the Premier League.”
Recorded in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the lead deep into Brighton's field during the match.
He took a climax of the ball to the left wing to Leroy Sane.

Scherzer wants to fight the Rockies.
With the Nationals eliminated from the final round of tickets, there was not much reason to start over.
But a belligerent Scherzer hopes to win Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but this is only meaningful given the Rockies, the team ahead of a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies won at least one spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure the top spot.
“While it’s pointless to play, at least we’ve got to throw the ball when we learn about the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and the other teams that will play in whatever form I can play this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in a game like that?
The Nationals have yet to announce the starter in Sunday's game, but it looks like Scherzer will be playing in this situation.
Scherzer, who kicks his 34th starter, will have Thursday’s throw practice and play on his Sunday break.
Washington's right-hand man scored 18-7 with 2.53 ERA (Average Run Value) and 300 attacks in 220 two-thirds of matches this season.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia
The president addressed the details of the situation around his Supreme Court, choosing Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of voting for Republicans in the midterm elections.
“Everything we do has potential in November.
There are only five weeks left until one of the most important elections in life.
This is one of the big, big things – not running but running is the reason I go everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump continued, “You’ll see that the negative, negative ultra-democratic party is here right now.
And they're determined to suppress power by using any tricks, and you'll see selfishness, tricks.
They don’t care who’s hurt, who has to step up to gain power and control, they just want to have power and control, and we’re not going to give them that.”
He added, “Democrats are trying to be ‘constrained and obstructed.’
“You’ve seen that for the last four days,” he added, adding that the Democrats are “angry and selfish and tricky and false.”
He pointed out that the Senate Judiciary Committee had identified Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein as having been booed from the bottom.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the information?
Why?
No, no, no, I expected—it was a non-excellent form of body language—that was the worst form of body language I had ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer an open party.
Offering an opinion is unacceptable.
I was not surprised when the activists of Momentum, in my local party, voted to censor me.
After all, I was the latest in a series of Labour MPs to be told that I was unwelcome – for raising my opinion.
As a member of Congress with me, Joan Ryan received the same treatment because she resolutely supported oppositionism.
In my case, the censorship move was aimed at me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a grand economic policy, on national security, in Europe, the same irony issues that Jeremy disagrees with previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that “we want meetings to be inclusive and effective.”
For nearly eight years as a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, Friday night leadership meetings were held in the same fashion.
Sadly, today, it’s not the tone in many meetings and the political promise of “kinder, tenderer” has long been forgotten and really whether that ever started.”
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and all opinions are judged on whether the party’s leaders accept them or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as my former colleagues thought that my political views had begun to expect me to change my mind and take positions that I would never approve of – whether on national security or just the EU market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and really no matter what I say – there is an abuse on social media calling for removal, denouncing central politics, telling me I shouldn’t join the Labour Party.
And not only do I feel that way.
Indeed, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments pointed at me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face the flow of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.
One of the saddest aspects of this political age is the degree of abuse that has become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn announced last week that the Labour Party should cherish a culture of tolerance.
The fact that we are no longer that open party and with every “no confidence” move or change in the rules of choice, the party has become narrow.
I’ve had a lot of advice over the past two years about urging me to stay calm, not to say too many words and then I’ll be “good.”
But I’m not in politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago when I was just a boy, I was motivated by the neglect of Thatcher’s government, which literally caused my comprehensive school to collapse, I have sought to provide better public services to those who need them most – whether local commissioners or government ministers.
I have never concealed my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be wrongly viewed about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who pushed the move on Friday, all I want to share is that as the country lags in Brexit, which will hurt our households, businesses and public services, I have no desire to waste my time and energy on loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But really, a message outside of Nottingham Momentum that I’m on my side, to my constituents, whether I’m a member of the Labour Party or not: I’m proud to serve and I promise that there will be no threat of elimination or any political means that will prevent me from acting on what I believe will be of the greatest benefit to my relatives.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Ayr is unbeaten
The latter two attempts may have falsified the final result, but there is no doubt Ayr deserved to win this award-winning Tennent Premiership match of the day.
Now they are at the top of the table, the only throne in ten teams.
After all, it’s also their super defensive line, as much as their better chances for them, bearing the title of the home team and coach Peter Murchie has the right to be completely satisfied.
He added: "So far, we've walked through our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I'm satisfied."
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said: “Give Ayr, they’ve got better chances than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute goal-scoring phase, added by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but, a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, opened the game for the Warriors, allowing Melrose to show his skills and Jason Baggot to score a ball to the goal.
Climo rose to lead Ayr with a penalty, before that, in the first half, he scored then scored an extra score with a solo draw raising the score to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose started the second half in a good way and Patrick Anderson scored, Baggot scoring more, shortening the score to five.
After a long period of serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had fallen behind, and since rebooting, Ayr was ahead by Stafford McDowall's stint, Climo scored extra points.
Acting captain Ayr, Blair Macpherson, was then struck by a yellow card, and again, Melrose cost the player an extra goal by scoring Bruce Colvine's non-scoring side, against a strained pressure.
However, the hosts were back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for playing against Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored on Ayr's support advantage.
Climo added points, as he has done almost since his re-emergence, after Kyle Rowe received David Armstrong's shot and passed to winger Gregor Henry after the home team's fifth goal.
The movie star Still Game is about to enter the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kieran is set to move into the hospitality industry after learning he is seen as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old star played Jack Jarvis in the BBC film, which he wrote and co-starred in Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the ninth season will be the last on the radio, which Kiernan seems to be planning for Craiglang’s later life.
According to the official list listed, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not comment on the matter, however, a source from the Scottish Sun said Kiernan was looking forward to embarking on a "prosperity restaurant business" in Glasgow.
‘The coast is ours’: Bolivian sealess nation hopes court will reopen route to Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters equipped in La Paz.
Public buildings all hang blue flags.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon were painted with the slogan: “The sea is our right.
The sea is our mission.”
Every corner of Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive – as well as the desire to sail to the Pacific Ocean once again.
Those hopes are perhaps the most burning in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international justice court ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat, said: “Bolivia is motivated, united and calm, and of course expected in a positive view of the outcome.”
Many Bolivians will monitor the ICJ’s ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will support Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of tense exchanges – Chile has the obligation to negotiate giving Bolivia a passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s convincing original president, who faces a fierce debate for re-election next year – also has many cards in Monday’s ruling.
At the end of August, he resolutely said, “We are about to return to the Pacific Ocean.”
But some analysts say the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia – and this is less likely to change.
The U.N. with headquarters in the Netherlands has no right to hand over territory to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of potential exchanges.
The ICJ’s ruling comes just six months after the final debates showed the situation was “not complicated at all,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, an expert on Chile’s international law.
And beyond Bolivia’s litigation, the last four years could be reversed.
Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said: “The issue of access to the sea has been attacked by the current Bolivian authorities.”
She added that Morales’s belligerent statements have extinguished all of Chile’s remaining goodwill.
At some point, Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate with each other, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltz<0xC3><0xA9>, Bolivia’s representative to The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
Monday will give Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual interest disagreements.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – is using the maritime issue as a political lifeline.
Bolivia added: “Bolivia will never give up access to the Pacific.”
“Judgement is an opportunity to see that we need to walk through the past.”
North Korea says it will never have a nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has revealed that his country will never denuclearize unless it can trust Washington before.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to deliver on its promises during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two sides.
He made remarks as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a "false dream" of continuing the sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean War to bring North Korea under control.
Washington is cautiously agreeing to a statement without Pyongyang making notable disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump look forward to a second summit.
But there is no small doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up an arsenal that it might see as the only way to ensure its safety.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris Fashion launches the latest line of wide-brimmed hats that are about to cover all the major streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or stay away from the sun completely, you don’t have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of unusually large head team designs in their SS19 collection on the runway that will stunned the design style at Paris Fashion Week.
Unapplied hats swept Instagram this summer and the designers brought their eye-catching creations to the stage.
Valentino’s signature item is a beige hat over the top of the wide-brimmed head attached to feather-like accessories, covering the head of the model.
Other oversized accessories include picky watermelon, witch hat and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks are stitched in a style that resembles Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One design resembles a scuba diving device complete with a snorkel and goggles, while another looks like a melting ice cream cone.
And if you keep catching in the direction of giant fashion – then you’re in luck.
It is predicted that large earrings may be about to be spread across the major streets near you.
The big hats became hot on the heels of ‘La Bomba’, the few-inch wide-brimmed hat used by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The admirable label behind the extremely unrealistic hat that’s been rolling out across social media has brought yet another big creation to the runway — a beach bag nearly as big as a bathing suit.
The burnt orange raffia bag, bordered by raffia with a white leather handle, is featured in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see large-sized seaside hats and bags flooding the big streets next summer – as the designer has made such a huge impact that it’s hard to ignore the demand for large-scale accessories.”
John Edward: Foreign language skills are essential for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland maintain their academic excellence, continuing in 2018 with a string of commendable academic results, underpinned by both individuals and groups in terms of sports, arts, music and community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, which are sponsored by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), are working to deliver the best quality of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to equip students with deep and broad knowledge, as well as the career orientation and status of their students as global citizens.
As an educational subdivision that can design and run the school’s distinctive curriculum, we see modern foreign languages continuing to be a popular and chosen topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in the language he understands, the things that come out go into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, what he says will come into his heart.”
This is a convincing message that we don’t just rely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From recent exams this year, we can see that foreign languages are leading the way in the rankings with the best private school pass scores.
A total of 68 percent of foreign language students scored higher than A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored more than an A in Chinese, along with 72 percent learning German, 69 percent learning French and 63 percent learning Spanish also scored an A.
This suggests that private schools in Scotland are moving in a direction that sees foreign languages as essential skills that children and adolescents will not be able to lack in the future.
Elective foreign language subjects are being valued as STEM majors (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in private school and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the British Skills and Occupational Council in 2014 found that among the reasons employers have difficulty finding people, is due to a lack of foreign language skills.
As a result, foreign language skills are becoming more and more practical in order to equip young people to enter the profession in the future.
With as many career prospects as possible in need of a foreign language, these skills become practical in an increasingly flat world.
No matter how people choose to work, if they learn a second foreign language, they will gain a real advantage in the future when they have such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly in the language of the natives themselves, a multilingual will inevitably lead every test.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of them were unable to practice a simple assembly in another foreign language, and only French was the only foreign language with a percentage of units, 15 percent.
That’s why investing in teaching foreign languages is essential for children today.
Having multilingual hands, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a brighter potential to find a real job.
In Scotland, each school teaches different languages.
Some schools will focus on more modern foreign languages, while others will teach foreign languages that are considered important to the UK in the vision for 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
No matter what your child enjoys, there are a variety of foreign languages to choose from in private schools, along with a team of teachers with expertise in the profession.
Private schools in Scotland focus on providing an academic environment that prepares and equips children with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is undeniable that, in an international business environment, foreign languages will continue to be extremely important factors for the future of the nation, which should be replicated in education.
In fact, modern foreign languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Private schools will continue to offer this opportunity to young Scots: diversity and excellence.
There can be no other choice.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron made his debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is coming to an end for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James play the first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season game against Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But how long you're going to be in the game, it's not clear.
Walton told the Lakers' official website: "It will be in less than 48 minutes."
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said it was likely that James would join the match for a limited time.
Following the week's training sessions, James was asked about plans for six pre-season games at the Lakers.
He said: “I don’t need to play a few pre-season warm-ups at this stage of my career.
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight, in Wheeling, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins his campaign.
This is the first leg of President Trump’s five campaign trips next week, including stops in support states such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
The approval vote for the candidate he nominated for the vacancy of the Supreme Court is being delayed, with President Trump trying to enlist support ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the vote begins in November.
Trump’s campaign in West Virginia starts at what time tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s campaign in West Virginia live on YouTube.
Trump will likely refer to this week’s hearing of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee who is currently facing allegations of sexual assault and the Senate’s vote of approval being postponed for a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
However, the main purpose of these rallies is to enlist support for Republican candidates ahead of the November election.
According to Reuters, the campaign’s goal through five campaigns next week is to “encourage volunteers and Republican supporters in the race to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is an important issue on the agenda, so the president will visit as many states as possible before entering the busy election season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Expected to take place in Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena, the rally tonight could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, while also attracting Pittsburgh media coverage,” West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday will be President Trump’s second visit last month to West Virginia, which he won by 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to support Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for West Virginia state senator, as he is currently behind in the polls.
Simon Haeder, a political science researcher at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters: “The president’s visit to the state to gain support in the vote for the candidate is not a good sign for Morrisey.”
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates determination to keep the trophy in singles matches on Sunday
After three unbalanced matches, Saturday afternoon doubles could be a necessity for the Ryder Cup.
The pendulum-style wrist swing to create momentum is an entirely new sport concept, but also a movement that the athlete really believes in, especially in matches like this.
Where is the current momentum?
"They're six points ahead, they're now four, and I think that's what motivates us," said Jordan Spieth on a relaxing walk.
Of course, the European team has an advantage, four points ahead, and they have 12 more matches left.
As Spieth says, the U.S. team still has a bit of hope and they are greatly encouraged, especially with the pairing of Spieth and Justin Thomas. These two players have played matches many times and each has won three points.
Spieth is a veteran player in playing the ball from the pitch to the hole and he always leads as an example.
The cheering screams were getting louder and louder as he reached his round, especially the kick to unravel the game as he and Thomas in turn hit the ball into the hole.
The kick to win the match on the 15th was the same, which meant that he had full confidence in the American team’s upswing.
Spieth said, “You have to think hard and worry about your own game.”
All the athletes have left.
There are 18 holes left to score.
In the past two days, only Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, an undisputed Ryder Cup legend, have been the only couple to score higher than Spieth and Thomas.
This strange but respectable pair of European teams won 4:0 and could not make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only pair not to hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also to avoid the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the following nine holes on Friday morning.
That victory and the energy from them spread to the buzzing crowd of supporters gave people the feeling that the two of them were rivals to be beaten on Sunday; and there were no more worthy golfers than Fleetwood or Molinari to defend the European team’s victory at sunset on Le Golf National Stadium.
Hopefully, both of you will be at different locations at the same time.
However, it is still too early to confirm the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the fourball series in the morning, as they paired up with Alex Noren.
One bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes left the Spanish and Swedish players completely losing the chance to counterattack.
On Sunday, no one could pull them out of that defeat.
Fourball and foursome matches are always most worth watching because the interaction between the duo, their advice and observing the strategy of playing change in just a few seconds.
The European team played better team-mates and came a long way ahead of the final day, but this foursome series shows that the US team has a chance to win.
European teams lead 10-6 before the start of Ryder Cup final day
The European team will take advantage before the last day of the Ryder Cup after a spectacular fourball and foursome series, ahead of the US team 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led this advantage by two wins over Tiger Woods for an additional four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, determined to retake the trophy to lose it to his friend at Hazeltine two years ago, won the U.S. side in the morning fourball, leading 3-1.
The U.S. team played better in the foursome series, winning two matches, but could not win the final.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points in Sunday’s singles series to win the trophy again.
Fleetwood was the first European player to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, often referred to as the "Molliwood" couple, were the second pair to have won four points in their opening four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball match, they had an even more convincing victory over Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a score of 5&4.
Woods played two games on Saturday and sometimes had flashy moments, but so far, he has lost 19/29 games in the fourball and foursome series, including seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, after resting in the morning fourball series, returned with Henrik Stenson in the foursome, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked 1st and 3rd in the world, with a score of 2&1.
However, although the weather in south-west Paris is extremely pleasant, the European team does not have an easy day to play.
The player who has won three times, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, set a milestone for the U.S. team with two points on Saturday.
They won 2&1 against Spanish goalkeeper Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball match, and then went on to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with a 4&3 score in the foursome, despite missing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice a team led by 4 points can start single matches, though, the Furyk team only need to hold the draw to keep the trophy.
After being considered second in two days, Sunday will most likely become an uptrend for the team.
North Korea says 'no way' unilateral disarmament without trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions are still being maintained to deepen its mistrust of the United States and that in this situation, there is no way that it will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho, speaking at an annual session of the UN General Assembly, said North Korea had taken “many goodwill measures” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test bases and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“However, we don’t see a similar move from the US side,” he said.
“If we can’t trust the American side, then we won’t be able to confidently guarantee our national security, and in such a situation, there’s no way we unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaint that Washington refused to denuclearize “stage by stage” and that North Korea would receive the corresponding benefit of taking it step by step, his remarks this time have a notable point of not rejecting the unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has refused before.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12. In this statement, Kim pledged to work toward “nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump promised security for North Korea.
North Korea is still trying to find a way to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists it must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposes calls for easing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increased pressure by sanctions to achieve its goals in a coercive way, even opposing the ‘declaration of an end to war’,” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us down on our knees is just a dream of people who don’t understand us.
“But the problem is that the sanctions that are still in place continue to lose our trust.”
Ri did not mention plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump, as the U.S. leader presented at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, he referred to three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the negotiator on the issue of nuclear disarmament is South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will not be in the same stalemate as it is today.”
Ri’s tone, however, was different from last year, when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s missile launch on the U.S. mainland was inevitable on a suicide mission after Trump called Kim “the Rocket Man.”
Last year at the United Nations, Trump threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for taking steps to disarm, but Trump also stressed that there is still a lot of work to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a deadline for this: “Two years, three years, or just five months is no problem.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its efforts.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The Security Council sanctions must continue to be vigorously and uncompromisingly enforced until we can confirm the result of complete denuclearization, ultimately, with verifiable evidence.”
The Security Council has agreed to step up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to halt funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo held talks with Ri on the sidelines of official UN General Assembly meetings and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the end result is not very good.
He left Pyongyang after a visit in July and said the talks had made certain progress, but just hours later, North Korea accused the foreign minister of making “black society-like demands.”
North Korea has pledged to take part in a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-In this month aimed at dismantling a missile test base and a nuclear complex if the United States makes a “similar move.”
He said Chairman Kim directed that the “similar move” he was seeking was the security assurance that Trump had pledged during the talks in Singapore and moved toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take full rest course
In an effort to combat the culture of machine-pressure learning, with ‘night owls’ drinking coffee instead of water, a new course at Harvard University this year has encouraged all college students to sleep more.
Students who study at this world’s number one university often don’t know the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Women’s Hospital and Brigham who designed the course, believes it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
The inspiration for starting this course came after he attended a talk about the impact of sleep deprivation on the learning process.
“After the talk, a female student came to me and said, ‘Why did you know this in the last year?’
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course was introduced for the first time this year, explaining to students how the importance of good sleep habits improves academic and athletic performance while improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding students with severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a range of interactive tasks.
In a section with a dorm room image, students can click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines, and books to learn about how caffeine, light, and sleep deprivation affect athletic performance, as well as the importance of forming bedtime habits.
In another section, participants were asked how long-term sleep deprivation may increase their risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, the university campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know that this course cannot immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,” Czeisler added.
The culture of “night owls” pride still exists, he said, while modern technologies and increasing pressure on students to sleep deprivation are an increasingly serious problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep, good sleep quality should become a student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, exhaustion, and anxiety – even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to fall into a state of hunger, leading us to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying biology, chemistry and physics, helped Czeisler design the course, and he also took one of last year’s classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course helped him ‘open his eyes’ and inspired him to make an effort to call for a course across the school.
He hoped that the next step would be to ask all postgraduate students to join a similar degree program before starting to compete in the main course.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students consider when setting an alarm for bedtime, waking hours, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘green light’ emitted by electronic displays and LEDs, which can cause disturbances in your circadian rhythms, resulting in difficulty sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga defeats Gerrard's boys
Rangers had an unsuccessful day when Dolly Menga's counter-attack led Steven Gerrard's side to a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
The Ibrox home team hoped to mark their first win since a 4–1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as head coach, extending an eight-point gap from the Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts lead team.
Menga remained on the offensive for seven minutes before the end of the first half, but Rangers' mood seemed to have never been crushed.
Rangers have now fallen to 6th place, while Livingston has climbed to 3rd place, and only behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And Rangers had to deal with another problem after border referee Calum Spence had to treat the head wound after an object was apparently thrown from the away end.
Gerrard changed the squad eight times from the one that surpassed Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, kept the Livi 11 draw and won a point against the Hearts team last week and he must be extremely happy with the way his students besieged their opponents in each attack.
Although the Rangers held the ball more, Livingston was the team that really made it dangerous to have the ball.
They should have scored just two minutes after Menga first pitched Scott Pittman, attacking Allan McGregor’s goal but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
A deep shot by Keaghan Jacobs brought the ball to captain Craig Halkett’s feet, but defender Alan Lithgow could only bring the ball to the back of the goal.
Rangers take control of the ball on the pitch, but their play is based mostly on hope rather than belief, especially in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos was certain that he had to get the penalty on the penalty spot because he and Steven Lawless had a collision but referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian player's appeal.
Rangers only scored twice in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lasana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's counterattack.
Although Livi’s opening of the score at 34 minutes is said to be advantageous, no one can deny that their win is entirely worth it.
Once again, Rangers couldn’t handle Jacobs’s deep throw.
Scott Arfield failed to react when Declan Gallagher poked Scott Robinson, while Scott calmly chose Menga to make a simple finish.
Gerrard immediately took the option during the break, replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and this replacement almost immediately had an impact as the winger poked the ball for Morelos but Kelly was impressed by the immediate blocking of the ball.
But Livingston succeeded in getting the visitors to play the way they wanted, as Lithgow and Halsett kept rolling out long passes.
Holt's side had the opportunity to rise to the front in the last minutes of the game, but unfortunately McGregor chose the right position to stop Jacobs before Lithgow headed wide from the corner.
The Rangers' new entry to the Glenn Middleton court went on to claim a penalty after colliding with Jacobs, but was again rejected by Thomson.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
A page from the Yearbook "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, inventing the foundation for the device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Counter has not only become a pillar of science, but also a pillar of popular culture. The following example is a dialogue in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring scientists and cowboy kings Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man: "What is this?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger Counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, the sentence can actually hear the effects of atoms emitted by radiation in the mineral.”
Evans: “Yes, there’s a buzz coming out here!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name remains with time.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System How to ‘Watch’ Damaged Cells
New Cancer Vaccines Could Teach Your Immune System How to ‘Watch’ Damaged Cells and Kill Them
Vaccines teach the immune system how to recognize damaged cells during treatment
This method includes taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the lab.
These cells can then ‘see’ proteins that are common in many cancers and are re-injected into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing positive results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with a vaccine teaches her immune system to recognize her damaged cells and ovarian cancer cells disappear after more than 18 months.
This includes taking immune cells from patients, changing cells in the lab, so that these cells can "see" the protein common in many cancers, called HER2, which is then injected back into the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands.”
HER2 "promotes the development of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Prof Berzofsky explains.
A similar method of study, taking immune cells from the patient’s body and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye receives many "stone bricks" as he expresses frantic support for Trump, wearing MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after Saturday's Live Music Night (SNL)
It's not going well.
Kanye West received many booing in the studio during SNL Music Night, after his manic performance. During the show, he praised US President Donald Trump and confirmed he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song, Ghost Town, still wearing the Make America Great Again hat, he angrily expressed his opposition to the Democratic Party and insisted on backing Trump.
“A lot of times I talk to my white friends and they say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
If I was worried about racism, I would have left the U.S. a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sub-series starring Matt Damon. In the sub-series, this Hollywood star ironically took Brett Kavanaugh's oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations.
Although the show was not aired, the footage of West's angry speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear whether Rock intentionally mocked West when he posted this.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was uncomfortable being behind the wings because of his hat.
“They bullied me when I was behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't show up with that hat."
They bullied me!
Then they said I was bogged down,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you know what it's like to get bogged down?", he insisted that he would "wear my hero's iconic hat, because nobody can force me to do anything. If you want the world to move forward?
Be loved.”
Variety reported that his speech caused the crowd to boo at least twice, while the SNL member was puzzled, with one saying: “The whole studio is silent.”
West was chosen to replace singer Ariana Grande, as her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many with the performance of I Love It, dressed like a Bottle Perrier.
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner. He once posted on Twitter: "To give one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SAYING TO SAY THE SAY OF THE WORLD."
But host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply “acting according to his nature, and that’s really great.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying music or costumes, or in favor of his ‘art’) because I believe that he or she is pursuing and spreading ideology that is not good for my community.
He has the right to freedom.
We too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, officially "Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, but only follows the path of Diddy, formerly known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly known as Snoop Lion; or legendary music legend Prince, had also changed his name to an icon and later changed his name to Prince.
Prosecutors charged in stabbing case at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in court at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Prosecutor’s Office.
Stars in Angry Kingdom Game Criticizes Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy television series, Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor was rather angry with the hero's prototype and mentioned that such male characters on screen would make young men feel strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture reporter, Kit said he believes “something is wrong here” and raised questions about how to address the toxic masculinity problem in the <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, 31. He admits he feels 'quite necessary' to solve this problem.
“At this point, I personally feel like I don’t know what we did wrong with so-called masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught men as adults about the problems that are before us?”
Kit believes that television may also be partly responsible for the growing toxic masculinity created by the extremely masculine characters they build.
He continued: “What are innate characteristics and what are educational traits?
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes boys feel like they have to be male stereotypes?
I think this is really a dilemma of this age – how do we change?
Because obviously there was something unreasonable with our young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he would not be involved in any prequel or extravaganza about Game of Thrones, after the series ended next summer, adding that he was “bored with battle and battle.”
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard’s remake of True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his wife, Rose, was the best thing when he decided to stop playing Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, which is where it started for my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose plays Ygritte, the lover of Jon Snow, whom Kit plays in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the grounds of the Leslie family mansion in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China Reports 14% Increase in Newly Infected People
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and Aids.
Health officials say the country has more than 820,000 people suffering from the disease.
In the second quarter of 2018, the number of new cases recorded was 40,000.
The vast majority of new infections are caused by sexually transmitted infections. This is a big change compared to the past.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV along this path has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and Aids in China has increased by 100,000 annually.
Sexually transmitted HIV infection is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Although homosexuality has not been considered illegal in China since 1997, discrimination against the LGBT community is still common.
Due to the country’s conservative traditional values, the study estimated that 70-90% of men would eventually get married, despite having had sex with men.
Many people are infected with the disease of the century by not using adequate protections during same-sex intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide HIV medicines to all infected patients to deal with the disease.
Maxine Waters denies that her staff leaked the data of Republican senators, emphasizing 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'
On Saturday, U.S. Democratic Representative Maxine Waters dismissed the allegation that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican senators to the Wikipedia page about lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles asserted that the complaints were settled by "extremely-right" experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and lies are even more despicable,” Waters wrote in a Twitter post.
According to the report, the leak included the home address and phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, from Utah.
The information began to appear online on Thursday, due to an unidentified person in Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on alleged sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the origins of posts related to Waters's office and leaked information about one of Waters's employees.
Waters went on to say, “This baseless allegation is absolutely untrue and absolutely a lie.”
“An employee in my office has been infringed on identity, personal information, and safety due to these false and misleading allegations that it is impossible for anyone to disclose such information.
“This unfounded accusation is totally untrue and is absolutely a lie.”
Waters’ statement immediately drew criticism online, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial statement expresses anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of an act that is not theirs, one should not be angry.
They are not challenged.
They were not questioned about the motives of the person making the accusation.
They have to show calmness and sanity.”
Fleischer seems to be comparing Waters’ response to Judge Kavanaugh’s response to Democratic criticism and critics also allege he was too angry at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican running for Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
“Big if true,” he wrote on Twitter.
Waters claimed that her office had warned "authorities and law enforcement about these false allegations.
“We will make sure the perpetrators are brought to light,” she continued, “and they will be held accountable for all actions that could harm and be dangerous to any of my employees.”
Johnny English is back – Rowan Atkinson’s humourless spy
Now, it can be seen that a fairly traditional trend in any new film with the British element is to find the meaning of Brexit. And the next episode of the Johnny English spy comedy-action series is no exception. The series began airing in 2003, with the name Johnny English and the second season Johnny English – Re-release, which premiered in 2011.
Will the act of mocking ourselves on the subject of how useless we ourselves are become a new export opportunity for this country?
In any case, Johnny English’s limited ability with his rounded eyes and flexible facial muscles is allowed to shuffle things up again – his name simply represents a comic book designed for non-English speaking areas.
Of course, he was a secret agent, although he always pretended to be oddly ducked in Inspector Clouseau’s style, mixing Mr. Bean’s humour and a bit of something to contribute to the theme Chariots of Fire during the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
The character’s prototype also relies on the international traveler and mysterious man Atkinson once starred in the Barclaycard TV commercial that has now fallen into oblivion and caused chaos upon waking up.
There are a few interesting scenes in the latest Johnny English episode.
I love watching Johnny English approach the helicopter while wearing his medieval armor and propellers pounding on his hat.
Although Atkinson’s humor is fully expressed, the humor here seems to be insufficiently heavy and slightly redundant, especially as “serious” film franchises like the 007 series and Impossible Mission have made comedy just a spice.
The humor in this film can only make fun of children, and I think that Johnny English’s blunders are not as creative and remarkable as the jokes in Atkinson’s silent film Mr. Bean.
The situation leading the story is that Britain is in serious trouble.
Hackers have infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents operating outside, leading to the demoralization of a spy on duty, a very unfortunate small role played by Kevin Eldon.
This was the prime minister’s last choice of chance, a proud and strong figure, who is now facing this inherent political crisis: Emma Thompson has performed very well in the version of Prime Minister Teresa May, but under the script she doesn’t have much playing ground.
Intelligence advisers reported that the identities of all active agents had been exposed and that she would have to mobilize a retired agent.
And that person is clumsy Johnny English, who is teaching in a rural area, but in fact is teaching off-campus lessons to become a secret agent: there are some fun jokes here, because English teaches students to be a Rock Academy-style spy.
English was summoned back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with the pitiful former aide Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, begging for a glamorous female submarine commander. Vicki Pepperdine takes on this gifted role.
So Batman and Robin are in trouble with the Queen's Order to return to duty and meet Olga Kurylenko as the beautiful spy Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in jeopardy under the spell of the glamorous tech billionaire after claiming he can solve Britain’s computer headaches: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their adventures with far-fetched antics: after disguising themselves as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant in a flash; causing chaos on Volta's luxury yacht; and English became even more messy when trying to use virtual reality headsets to explore Volta's home.
At the end of the film, the knots will certainly be removed, but such excitement is quite similar to those for children’s TV channels.
It's a pretty trivial work.
And like other Johnny English movies, I can’t help but ask the question: Can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a fair role that deserves your talent?
Labour rejects plans to allow Britons to work for four days but earns five days' pay
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week but earn five days a week.
According to the information received, the party wants business owners to transfer the savings from the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
This means that employees can take a three-day weekend off but still receive the same salary as before.
Sources said the idea was "in line" with the party's economic agenda and expected to increase support for the country's workers.
The British Union Congress has confirmed the move to four days a week as a way for workers to enjoy the benefits of a changing economy.
A senior source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "The review of policies is expected to be published later this year.
“This goal is not possible in the short term, but working four days a week is an aspiration in line with the party’s policy of rebalancing the economy in favor of workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse the idea. The British Green Party pledged to work four days a week during the 2017 campaign.
However, this idea has not been adopted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day-week working policy is not party policy and the party is not currently considering it."
Shadow Prime Minister John McDonnell leveraged last week’s Labour conference to strengthen his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from the hands of “anonymous directors” and “benefactors” at utility-service companies.
These schemes by the shadow prime minister also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not be able to get back all of their shares as the Labor Party government can apply ‘deductibles’ based on behavior deemed to be false.
He also confirmed plans for workers to join the company’s board and set up a Comprehensive Ownership Fund to hand over 10% of the equity capital of private companies to company employees, from which they can receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh would change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote to appoint him as Supreme Court Justice for at least a week and raised questions about whether the results of the Federal Intelligence Service investigation could cause any Republican senator to withdraw support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI had found any evidence that might have caused the senators to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Mr. Kennedy said.
“I said during the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, that is, after the accusation was made and asked, 'Did you do that?'
He responded very decisively, decisively and decisively.”
However, Graham’s vote seems to have been absolutely certain.
He said: “I’ve decided on Brett Kavanaugh, and only a single, groundbreaking charge will change my mind.”
“Professor Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it very strongly,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all the people she told her name couldn’t verify the story.
36 years have passed.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizenship Festival and what does it contribute to the eradication of poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive star cast to carry out an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
In the seventh year of the event, the Global Citizens’ Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Reduction Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting poverty.
To receive a free entrance ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), music night attendees must complete a range of tasks or "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or any other meaningful form to help raise awareness of the goal of poverty alleviation.
But how successful has this Global Citizenship Festival been, when there are now only 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding tickets for a free music night for everyone a practical way to convince people to call for action, or just another form of “keyboard movement” – people feel they are making a real difference by signing a petition online or submitting a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, the Global Citizenship Organization says there are more than 10 million “actions” from supporters on record, promoting a range of different goals.
They say these actions have helped push leaders around the world to make commitments and policies equivalent to the more than $37 billion set up to implement interventions that improve the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from the group’s actions, with at least $10 billion already disbursed or raised funds.
The group estimates that so far, guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partner organization that includes investors and implementers, committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” promising to provide $25 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter posts from the Global Citizens group.
“With support from the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can turn the social injustices that lead to malnutrition into a historic marker,” the program’s Ambassador for Nutritional Strength, Tracey Ullman, told an audience during a live performance in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for a project called Nutritional Strength, which ensures nutritional interventions for 5 million women and children.
Responding to one of the frequently asked questions on the group’s website, “What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizens team responded: “This will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail.
But like previous civil rights movements and anti-racism movements, we will succeed because together, we will become stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to "block" Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
The Washington Examiner quoted U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could mobilize the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleges that Russia’s involvement in Syria – more notably at the invitation of the legitimate government – is just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
According to the report, he said: “I believe the reason they entered the Middle East is because they wanted to trade energy like in Eastern Europe, the southern depression of Europe.”
And according to official news, there are many ways and measures to prevent this.
“The United States has the ability to use the Navy to ensure that the seaborne shipping routes remain open and will close, when necessary, to ensure that their energy sources are not brought into the market,” he said.
Zinke has called on attendees of the event to be hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a self-proclaimed non-profit group that is the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that the two methods are equally effective.
“The economic option that Iran and Russia can choose is to take advantage of and change the type of fuel,” he said, while calling Russia “the only one with a single strength” with an economy that relies solely on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration is seeking to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, in order to replace Russia’s position, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 oil and gas project that, Trump said, gave Moscow “complete control” of Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 oil and gas project, which was built to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project simply stems from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and consumers must be selected for suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has sparked a backlash from Germany, which has since reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in the European Union’s energy policy, as well as bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when there is a third country trying to interfere with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, president of the German Confederation of Industries (BDI) said after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will ‘Seriously Consider’ 2020 Presidential Election, Massachusetts Senator Says
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would consider running.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and correct government errors, and that’s what it takes for a woman to be at the top.”
“After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president.”
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during a town hall meeting and said he was “taking the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m really worried about what Donald Trump will do for our democracy,” she said.
Warren is outspokenly critical of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Twitter post on Friday, Warren said “of course the FBI must investigate before voting.”
But a poll on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters don't think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Center for Political Studies, 58 percent of voters in Massachusetts say senators should not run.
Thirty-two percent voted for her to run.
The poll found that more voters supported former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of voters supporting him and 48 percent of voters opposing him.
Other potential Democratic candidates named when referring to the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make an official decision before January.
Sarah Palin cited Track Palin's Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) syndrome at Donald Trump's campaign
Track Palin, 26, served a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, I can totally relate to other families who have suffered the consequences of PTSD and the damage our soldiers carry when they come back,” she told a crowd at the rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest of her son "a clear matter but nobody wanted to talk about" and said her son and other veterans returning from the war had "changed, more thorny, and wondered whether there was respect for them and their comrades, airmen and every other member of the military for what they had done for this country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assaulting a woman, preventing others from reporting on domestic violence and possession of weapons while drunk.
Eighteen states and D.C. support challenging new refugee policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are advocating challenging the new U.S. policy of refusing to give asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives of 18 states and D.C. sent a short collective text on Friday in Washington in support of asylum seekers opposing the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace and Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August in protest of the federal policy has not yet been disclosed.
She said her lover "and the sons of members of his violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials declined her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Pro-Grace state prosecutors describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum applicants are in the U.S., as countries face widespread gang and domestic violence issues.
The new U.S. asylum policy goes against the 2014 decision of the Migration Appeals Council to allow undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine announced on Friday that the new policy "ignore the decades-old system of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires consideration of all asylum applications based on the specific facts and circumstances of the claimant and this policy of obstruction violates that principle,” the collective short text stated.
Prosecutors also argue in the short text that the policy of denial of immigration harms the U.S. economy, because immigrants are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide adequate sources of necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions asked immigration lawyers not to allow asylum for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang abuse in June.
“Only allow asylum to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement on the policy.
Asylum is never a means of mitigating all the problems — even all the serious ones — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race for survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dire.
“It’s really stressful,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she patted her fever-stricken son at an evacuation center in the desperate city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in more bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up belongings submerged in water, trying to salvage anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were completely overcrowded, after damage caused by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris with a broken back and shoulder, are lying outside Palu Army Hospital. Here patients receiving outdoor treatment due to strong aftershocks continue.
His tears flashed as he recalled the sensation of a violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“We don’t even have time to save ourselves.
I suppose I was thrown into the rubble of the wall,” Haris told The Associated Press, adding that his family had come to town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife crying and crying for help, but then I heard nothing.
I don’t know what happened to my wife.
I hope they are all safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda advertising'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that covered the common interests of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media for propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned an additional sum of China Daily to Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing is seeking to interfere in the U.S. election marks a new stage in Washington’s intensifying campaign of pressure on China according to what U.S. officials have told Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, with evidence that they have imposed high tariffs on imports from both sides.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s tariff policy in retaliation in the early stages of the trade war was designed to target exporters in pro-Trump Republican states such as Iowa.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime former governor of Iowa, which exports large agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, saying that China "is continuing that bullying behavior by running propaganda ads in our own free newspaper."
“In an effort to spread propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, at the newsstands on the streets of Beijing, you rarely find a dissenting opinion and will not see any genuine reflection on the various Chinese opinions on China’s difficult economic trajectory, because it is clear that the media are completely under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most popular newspapers has shied away from the offer to publish" his article, though he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating women before midterm elections with Kavanaugh's case
As many of the top Republicans stand to defend the nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh against a few sexual assault allegations, analysts warn they may suffer backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The feelings surrounding the incident were strong and most of the Republican candidates on the list indicated they wanted to continue voting.
There are things we can’t do again,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he didn’t think Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) had pressed the FBI’s consent button to conduct an investigation sufficient to appease angry voters.
The Washington, D.C. newspaper quoted Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, as saying: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – tomorrow they will not forget and by November they will not forget.”
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they marched on the Senate corridor because the Republicans who are in control of the Judiciary Committee chose to continue voting for Kavanaugh despite Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony.
“Intentionalism and democratic momentum will be pushed higher than ever,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“It is said that this motivation is now very high; yes.
But it could be even higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, ages 18 to 29 often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford publicly took the oath of office on details of sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said the public would likely have a backlash if Republicans continued their confirmation.
NBC News quoted Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, as saying last week: “This could become a mess that the Republican Party has to deal with.”
“It’s not just the committee’s vote or the official vote, or whether Kavanaugh will become a Supreme Court Justice, it’s more important the way Republicans handle the issue this time and the way they treat the accuser,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, the Democratic Support Group, told the news channel.
Americans, however, disagree on whether to trust Ford or Kavanaugh’s testimony, which appears to be more doubtful on Kavanaugh’s part.
A new poll conducted by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents are certain or can trust Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they are sure or can trust Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% of respondents thought Kavanaugh could or certainly had lied when giving testimony, while only 30% thought Ford was certain or could have lied.
After Flake pressed the button, the FBI was investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford was sworn in before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh attacked her when she was drunk, when she was 17.
Ramirez accused the Supreme Court judge of exposing his genitals in front of her when they attended a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
World Wide Web Inventor Plans to Start Building New Internet to Acquire Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is now launching a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend’s latest project is called Inrupt, a company built on Berners-Lee’s Solid open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where the data is stored and what permissions people are given to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind the Inrupt project was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to start now,” he said of this startup project.
“Now is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology, which allows users to create their own “personal data store online” or POD.
This data repository can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, other personal and professional tools.
Like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all are available in a single browser and display simultaneously.
What is unique about this online personal data repository is that users have the full authority to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “exercising control over data to individuals.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of the Inrupt project is to ensure the company is equipped with the right resources, processes and skills to help deliver Solid to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that has been acquired by IBM, a number of developers who have signed on to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not discuss with “Facebook and Google whether or not there was a complete change because all of their business models were fully upgradable overnight.
“We don’t need to ask for their permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Association (Global Network) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential name in the debate over net neutrality.
Despite the launch of the Inrupt project, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Association, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann receives the Victoria Cross in World War 1
The centenary of the 100th anniversary of the award of Queen Victoria's Cross in World War I as a warrior was held in his home country.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he died of a sniper attack four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honors.
On Saturday, two of his nephews unveiled a commemorative stone during the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was a “brilliant symbol” when the stone was displayed exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s feat of winning a medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann commanded his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through thick fog, under strong fire from rifles and machine guns."
Then he plunged into the bullets and with "great courage", he led the battalion to the top, before crashing into a rifleman and knocking down three commandos.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I myself would never do, but there was humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann also placed a wreath after the Royal Brentwood Young Band parade leading the way.
Vann said he felt "a great honour to be part of the parade" and that "the bravery of a true hero will be recognized by the support of so many people."
Martial arts fans stay up all night to watch Bellator 206, but eventually they just get Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed up all night waiting for the Bellator 206 with a packed stand, but were eventually denied access to the main event.
The show's introduction from San Jose said there were 13 battles, including six on the main card and was shown live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to play, viewers in England were stunned when the screen turned into Peppa Pig.
Some people feel disrespected after they get up close to the morning to watch the game.
One fan said on Twitter that turning the show into a children's cartoon was like "an unfathomable joke."
“The government stipulates that martial arts at 6 a.m. is inappropriate, so they have to translate it into a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communications, said when asked about the move.
"Peppa the pig," that's right.
Bellator Company President Scott Coker said it was considering a broadcast schedule to ensure British audiences could watch the show in the future.
Coker said, “I think if we play back, we can solve the problem.”
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday and we can’t handle it until Sunday in our time zone, but it’s Monday in their time zone.
But we are trying to find a solution.
Believe me, when people change programs, there are a lot of messages back and forth and those messages are not very friendly.
We tried to fix it, initially we thought it was due to a technical malfunction.
But that’s not the case at all, it’s because of government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
“We will reduce the number of matches to five, instead of the six as originally planned – five is the number of matches we usually provide and we have tried to deliver the excess to the fans.
This is truly an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs show: Tom Daley feels ‘bad’ about sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says that when he grows up, he feels inferior to people because of his sexual orientation – but that’s what drives him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize “I don’t look like anybody” until he was in school.
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he has spoken out about gay men's rights to bring "hope" to others.
He also said being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off to heal.
In the first issue led by Laverne, Daley appeared as an abandoned person, saying he felt "bad" to everyone, because "his gender is not socially acceptable as boys and girls clearly."
“To this day,” he says, “the feeling of feeling inferior and different still exists, becoming the driving force and strength for me to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he had “something accomplished” so that people wouldn’t be disappointed to learn the truth about his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become an active campaigner for the LGBT community and he uses his image at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to oppose discrimination against homosexuals.
He said he spoke up because he felt very lucky to be able to live openly without being discriminated against and wanted to bring "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion shared that he fell in love with a man - American film producer Dustin Lance Black. The two met in 2013 and "suddenly fell in love."
Daley was married to the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference was never an obstacle between the two.
“When you’re going through so much pain as a child,” he first participated in the Olympic Games when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, “it’s hard to find someone of the same age who has experienced ups and downs in his life.
The couple became the parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that both of his "worldviews" had changed.
“If you asked last year, my goal was ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medal.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was dying and one of the last things he asked was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘I can’t sit in the front row anymore,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he took his last breath and even when he stopped breathing and died forever, I finally couldn’t admit that he had to be invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I just know that it’s been my whole life’s dream – jumping in front of a crowd of fans at the Olympic Games, there’s really no greater feeling than that,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose his first song, Heather Small’s Proud, which accompanied him in training towards the Olympic Games and still touched him every time he listened to it again.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 at 11:15 BST, Sunday.
Mickelson lacks form on Ryder Cup bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to raise his form to avoid this record becoming a sad experience.
Mickelson played in this biennial event 12 times but captain Jim Furyk left him on the bench in a series of fourball and foursome games on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of action as in the US, this five-time winner spends all day cheerleading and playing games in the hope of getting rid of discomfort.
The 48-year-old golfer with a knack for flat strokes has never been the ideal choice for a tight Le Golf National course, even when he is at the top of his form, because the wrong shots here will suffer heavy consequences.
And if the course is not yet haunting enough, Mickelson will have to play his ninth game on Sunday against Francesco Molinari, the Open Championship champion. This week, Molinari paired up with new Tommy Fleetwood and won all four games.
If the U.S. team, which is currently losing four points before the start of the 12-match singles series, wants to start impressively, Mickelson’s match is paramount.
Furyk expressed confidence in his golfer and didn’t say too much.
“He understands his role very well today, he pats me on the back, puts his arms around me and says he will be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He is a legend and has contributed a lot to the team, in the past and throughout this week.
I could never have imagined that he played two games.
I imagine more, but that’s how things go and we think that’s the right path.
He wants to play, like all the other team-mates.”
This Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record, becoming the most-matched player in the Ryder Cup.
It could also mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup because the peaks in his personal record have never appeared in this Tournament.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and draws, though Furyk thinks his presence brings intangible value to the team.
"He's funny, or sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of people. Having him in the group is really fun," he explains.
“I think the young players are happy to see him and this week is also quite fun.
What he gave was more than a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead advantage can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, had the experience that although his team had a lot of lead when entering the Ryder Cup final singles matches, the results could be easily reversed in an uncomfortable way.
The Dane began playing in 1997 at Valderrama, in which their team, led by Seve Ballesteros, led by five points ahead of the U.S. team but ended up winning only close by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You always have to remind yourself that we were ahead a lot at Valderrama; we were ahead a lot at Brookline and we lost, at Valderrama, we won, but we struggled,” Björn said, with a face pictured after watching the Class of 2018 game with a 5-3 victory on Friday and a 10-6 lead yesterday at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on the team that it's not the end.
You still have to be mentally focused tomorrow.
Go out and play well.
The tournament is not finished when the score is not yet on the table.
We have the goal of winning the trophy this year and that is our focus.
I always say I’m focused on my 12 players, but we also understand the strength of your team – they’re the best players in the world.”
Excited by the performance of his players on the bumpy course, Bjorn added: "I'll never tell you anything.
Tomorrow will be another war.
Tomorrow is an individual show and it will be very different.
It would be great to play in pairs and things go well, but when you play individually, all the possibilities of a player are revealed.
That’s the message you have to share with every player, that they have to be ready to play their best tomorrow.
Now a pair of matches have to be separated and each one has to be ready to play the best.”
In contrast to Bjorn, the opponent’s captain, Jim Furyk expected his players to show better individual abilities than when playing in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both directions during the major turning points on the last day, having been a member of the winning team at Brookline before losing while the European team was hailed as "The Miracle in Medinah."
“I memorize every word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the team’s captain in 1999, gathered and encouraged the players before the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you’ll want to start as quickly as you see Brookline, or as you see in Medinah.
When the result is following a trend, the matches in the middle will be under a lot of pressure.
We build the squad that way and send the player out on a strategic basis and try to do the feat tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with leading the team and facing Rory McIlroy in the top-flight match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, other European players in the first series.
“I chose this group, in that order because I believe it’s the way to get through,” Bjorn said of his choice for the singles match.
The new German warship has been put on hold.
Local media reported that the latest German Navy destroyers were supposed to have run tests in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it wasn’t until at least next year that they could be tested due to faulty systems and rising costs.
The newspaper Die Zeit quoted a military spokesman as saying: “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the lead ship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to have been delivered to the Navy in 2014, but the post-delivery troubles hampered the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class destroyers.
This means the ships will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some stealth technologies, such as radar, infrared, and acoustic trace reduction.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period – it is possible to deploy the latest destroyers away from national ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delay means that these modern warships – which are supposed to help Germany take control of foreign countries – will become obsolete at the start of use, Die Zeit notes.
The unlucky frigate F125 became a headline last year when the German Navy officially refused to test and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Very little is known about the reason behind the return, but German media mention serious "software and hardware failures", resulting in the ship being completely useless for combat duty.
Software flaws are particularly serious because the Baden-Wuerttemberg will be operated by a fleet of 120 sailors – half the manpower of the old Bremen-class destroyers.
At the same time, it can be seen that the weight of the vessel increased significantly, resulting in reduced performance and limited future upgrade capabilities of the Navy.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is thought to weigh twice as much as the same warship used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also a serious problem.
The project is said to have pooled significant capital to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – while the initial estimated cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The issue of mobilizing the latest destroyers has become particularly important, amid recent warnings of Germany’s shrinking naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy was indeed “lacking warships capable of combat.”
The official said the problem has been exacerbated over time, because the old ship has been decommissioned but there are no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships were eligible to join the Navy.
National Trust listens to the bat's secret life
A new study is underway at a site in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use natural landscapes to hunt for food.
It is hoped that these findings will shed light on the behavior of this unique flying mammal and guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, tracked the journeys of popular bats, soprano pipistrelles, brown ears bats, and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens area in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be located in key locations around the research site to monitor the activity of these bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The audio analyst will conduct an analysis of all sound recordings and determine the sound frequency of bat species and the purpose of playing the sound of each specific bat genus.
Then a map and report of bat habitats will be created to have a detailed picture of the natural landscape of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS’s nature conservation advisor, hopes the results will help determine which habitats are most important to bats and how each species lives in that environment.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management activities of organisms, such as planting pastures and the best way to conserve forests for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect bat bean truss and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting systems, fly trap paper, some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as pet cat attacks can also pose a risk to bats.
Bats are not completely blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, the ears are more useful than the eyes when stalking and catching prey.
They use an extremely sophisticated echo positioning technique to identify obstacles on the flight path.
NTS is responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, while attaching special importance to bats.
The organization has ten trained professionals who regularly carry out surveys, tests, and sometimes participate in animal rescue.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Managing the land, David Thompson said the land was their ideal territory.
“Threave is a great habitat for bats,” he said.
“We have a lot of old buildings, a lot of trees and a good living environment.
But there is still a lot of mystery about bats, so work here and at other facilities will help us better understand what bats need to grow further.”
He stressed the importance of examining bat life before conserving in the lands, because the accidental destruction of their breeding truss can kill up to 400 offspring and vomit offspring, almost completely destroying the population.
Bats are protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their bean truss.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an employee of the Scottish Bat Conservation Foundation, encouraged the community to help.
“We still need to learn more about bats, and with many species, we can’t know how far apart their populations are.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations and his lawyer prepares to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the sexual charges against him were “fake news” and that someone “wanted to profit” by his name.
His lawyer is preparing to sue the German daily Der Spiegel for posting the accusation.
The Portuguese striker who currently plays for Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday: The player reportedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
In a live video on Instagram in front of 142 million followers hours after the allegations were announced, Ronaldo, 33, claimed the report was “fake news.”
“No, no, no.
What they say today is all fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or player told the camera.
“They want to use my name for profit.
That's normal.
Say my name, they're famous, but that's just part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the player added and smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegation, which they called “inadmissible suspicions about private life.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would claim due to "moral damages to the amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which may be one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a luxury room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have returned to the player's dorm room. According to records filed in Clark County Court, Nevada, he is accused of raping her at the hotel.
Mayorga said Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was “99 percent” a “good guy”, with only “1 percent” not a good one.
There are reports that Ronaldo confirmed that the two sides had sexual relations, but based on consensus.
Mayorga also said she went to the police station and was photographed with injuries at the hospital, but she later agreed to mediate out of court because she was "afraid of reprisal" and worried because of "public humiliation."
The 34-year-old said she is now seeking to overturn her previous decision to mediate as she continues to be traumatized by the incident in the allegation.
At the time of the allegation, Ronaldo was preparing from Manchester United to move to Real Madrid, but eventually this summer he switched to play for Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer deal.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturer status
Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would "forever regret" losing its post-Brexit car manufacturing leadership position.
He added that it was "worried" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union without any further agreement, it would stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced nearly 150,000 units last year, of which 90 percent were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK is completely out of the European Union by the end of March then we will have to stop production at this plant,” said Marvin Cooke, executive director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also raised concerns about Britain leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of automakers is supply chain risk in the event of Brexit without another deal.
Toyota's production line operates on the "just-in-time" principle, with spare parts delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers in the UK and the European Union for vehicles manufactured on orders.
If Britain leaves the EU without another deal on March 29, there is a potential disruption at the border, and the sector fears could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota said it could not keep its inventory value for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, so it would have to stop production.
Clark said Prime Minister Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the European Union would be “correctly adjusted to avoid checks at the border.”
"We need to make a deal. We want to make the best deal, not only to ensure success in the present, but also to make sure we seize this opportunity very well," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“Evidence from Toyota and other automakers shows that we need to ensure continued supply chains are successful.”
Toyota has not yet announced how long it will be sure to stop production, but in the long term, it warns that additional costs will reduce the factory’s competitiveness and, ultimately, workers will lose their jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and convened the Unite union at the factory, said his members were increasingly worried: “In my experience, once I lose these jobs, there will never be again.
A government spokesman said: “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
White House Announces Meeting Between Trump and Rosenstein May Be Delayed Again
The White House announced on Sunday: President Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “a week behind” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian election meddling, links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the president’s ability to obstruct justice.
Whether Trump fired his deputy attorney general, which resulted in Mueller being unlikely to be able to operate independently, has been fueling rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing headphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein declined to report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid speculation that he was about to step down.
Instead, his meeting with President Trump – who was visiting the U.N. General Assembly in New York at the time – is scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "doesn't want" to sack Rosenstein but the meeting was delayed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing between Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse who testified.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FBI to spend a week investigating the allegations against Kavanaugh, while continuing to delay the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, she said: “The date has not yet been set, possibly this week, could see the reason for this postponement is because other issues are taking place in the Supreme Court.
But we will soon receive the news and the press will be updated.”
Some reporters may disagree with the statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since Sept. 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to dislike of television reporters “too much,” though she had said: “I also agree that reporters are actually a lot of things.”
She then suggested that there be more direct links between President Trump and the press.
“The president is currently doing more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” she added without citing: “We’ve looked at the number of press conferences.”
Sanders said there would still be press conferences but "if the press had a chance to directly ask the president of the United States, that would be much better than talking to me.
We’ve tried a lot and you’ve seen us do a lot over the last few weeks, which will replace a press conference when you can speak directly to the president of the United States.”
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or during press conferences when officials visit him.
Simple press conferences are rare.
This week, in New York, the president was supposed to announce the reason, but he suddenly appeared in strange form in front of a crowd of reporters.
Health minister writes letter to European Union employees working in Scotland's health sector to talk about fears of Brexit
The health minister has written to European Union employees working in Scotland's health sector to express the nation's gratitude and hope that staff will remain after Brexit.
Health Minister Jeane Freeman sent a letter with a message that he would resign within six months of the UK's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to supporting the cost of applications for the status of residence of EU citizens working in the transferred public service industry.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During this summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union over Britain's withdrawal from the European Union continue, which is expected to take place this fall.
But the British government is also stepping up preparations for a scenario that may not reach an agreement.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
That’s why I want to reiterate that I now appreciate the contributions of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
Moreover, colleagues from the European Union have brought valuable experience and skills to help strengthen and improve health services, while benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would like you to stay.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee Tigers’ vertical defender Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 defeat to Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Mike Organ in Tennessee reported.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the first half break.
“He ran towards the vertical border and collapsed,” Reed said.
The coaches and paramedics gave Abercrombie oxygen right at the vertical edge before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further examination.
An official from Tennessee told Chris Harris at the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is no detailed information on the extent/type of injury" and that Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in the red jersey, played for the first time in Tennessee after moving back from Illinois.
He had a total of five matches on Saturday before being eliminated from the game and he had a total of 18 matches this season.
Foreigners who buy property in the UK will be charged higher taxes.
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher taxes, which will be used to help the homeless under Tory’s new policies.
This change will negate the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.
Tax increases will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The finance ministry expects the policy will help raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged higher taxes – the extra money will be used to help the homeless, Prime Minister Theresa May will announce today.
The change will negate success in Jeremy Corbyn’s bid to attract young voters with a commitment to offer cheaper housing and targeting high-income people.
The tax increase will apply to non-paying individuals and businesses in the UK, which will boost the government’s efforts to combat the current stagnation.
The surcharge – in addition to the current tax rate, which includes higher taxes announced two years ago on the second home and the homes purchased just for that – could be up to three percent.
The finance ministry expects the change to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London have been sold to non-British citizens, which pushes home prices up and makes it increasingly difficult for first-time home buyers.
Many of the country’s wealthy areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” as the majority of foreign home buyers spend most of their time in other countries.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for tax cuts to give many young people a chance to own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by taking land but not using it, urging May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix the “home problem” in the UK.
Corbyn also announced a series of housing reforms aimed at attracting voters, including controlling renting and ending “no faults” deportations.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would spend my tenure restoring the British dream – that life would be better for the next generation.
And that means having to re-regulate the housing market is very chaotic right now.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build lives here.
However, this does not mean that people who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad can easily buy homes like hardworking British residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of owning a house has become too far-fetched and the stagnation is still huge.”
Jack Ross: ‘My last ambition is to lead Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross said his "last ambition" was to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
Scot, 42, is facing the challenge of reviving the Northeast club, which currently holds third place in League One, three points behind first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I want to play for my country as a player.
I had a hat with a B-logo and that's what I wanted," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“My years of childhood were associated with those Scottish matches that took place in Hampden with my father, and that’s always something I remember.
However, that opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing the club.”
Sunderland's predecessors to Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel pressured to be his successor after the big names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The success for me at the moment will be judged by 'Can I bring the club back to the Premier League?'
The organisational structure and facilities at this club certainly belong to the Premier League,” he said.
"This is not a task to be achieved easily, but I only see myself as successful if I can bring the club back into the league."
Ross spent three years as a manager, after a stint as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as a coach at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to third place, and put St Mirren from the risk of relegation to be the next season's champion.
Ross said he now feels very comfortable throughout his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It’s probably a real turning point,” he recalled in his lead role at Alloa.
“I really believe that I am more suited to a managerial role than a player.
This sounds strange because I was quite successful, had a good income and achieved certain achievements as a player.
But the game is usually not easy.
There are a lot of things you have to face every week.
I still have to endure the stress and pressure of work but I am satisfied with the management job.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, I feel most comfortable being myself during my adult life.”

The survey found that the ideal time to enjoy a beer is 5.30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has increased sales for struggling pubs in the UK but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to data, pubs and bars saw revenue rise 2.7 percent in July — but restaurant sales fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA, a consulting firm, said: “The prolonged sunshine and England entering the World Cup rounds made July’s sales trend similar to June’s, when pubs rose 2.8 percent, and restaurants were hit harder.
Sales at restaurants fell 1.8 percent in June and worsened in July.
Bars and pubs specializing in beverages have the fastest growth when compared to declines in restaurants.
Pubs specializing in food are also affected by the heat, though not as severe as restaurants.
Looks like everyone just wants to drink.
Sales of beverages in managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent during the month while food sales fell by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, RSM hospitality and entertainment industry analyst, said: “These results represent the trends we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to revenue at restaurants.
Unsurprisingly, restaurants continued to struggle, with revenue falling 4.8 percent year-on-year while cost pressures continued to rise.
“The long hot summer has come at the worst time for food suppliers, it’s not known in August if cooler weather could improve the current situation.”
Total revenue growth at pubs and restaurants, including newly opened venues, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand rollout.
Coffer Peach Tracker’s sales supervisor for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK collected and analyzed data on work efficiency from 47 active groups, with combined sales of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, which is the industry benchmark.
One in five children have a secret social media account that parents don’t know about
One in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that parents and teachers don’t know, the survey found
Survey results of 20,000 secondary school students show that the number of "virtual Insta" pages has increased significantly
The news has raised concerns about the rise of online pornography
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account to show parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed rapid growth in “fake Insta” accounts, a reference to Instagram photo sharing.
The news has heightened concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they use a “main” account with no bad content to show their parents, and also have their own accounts.
A mother stumbles upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, and finds a teenager urging others to “rape me.”
According to a study by the UK Digital Content Awareness Association and the Principals Workshop (HMC) in civil schools, 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two records, and half of them admit to having their own accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers can’t find.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "representer of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as the non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most medal-winning athlete in Scotland, and Ian Beattie sees the change as a great opportunity for sports coaches to use her rich playing experience in international arenas over the past decade.
“Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish athletics community, the UK and around the world, we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by electing her to the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be a representative of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland."

He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I can't go.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I could recover or if I was in any condition.
It was a tiring journey but to fully recover, to learn how to walk again and now I am able to walk fast!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!”
Advertisement of breast pumps comparing mothers to dairy cows has divided opinion online
A company that specializes in vacuum cleaners has divided online opinion with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To mark the launch of the product that is considered “the world’s first wearable and noise-free milk pump,” consumer technology company Elvie launched an ad inspired by satirical music videos to show the freedom that the new vacuum gives mothers.
Four mothers jumped in a barn full of hay with the following lyrics: "Yes, I milk my own milk, but you don't see a tail and "In case you don't realize, these are not breasts, they are my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Take out milk, suck out milk, I’m feeding the kids, suck out milk, suck out milk, I’m milking my girls.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a lot of controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said the ad underestimated the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It was a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they must also become pregnant and give birth to babies in order to produce milk, with the exception of young cows being robbed from their mother cows within a few days of giving birth,” one person wrote.

Another commented: “This can be psychologically damaging to both mother and baby.
That’s right, why not use it to advertise breast-feeding moms?”
Another commented, “This ad has nothing to do with it.”
There were people who also defended the ad, a woman admitted that she found the song "fun".
“I think this is a unique idea.
I'll buy myself one if I still breastfeed my baby.
Drinking milk really makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a bit crazy, but I understand its message.
This is a unique product,” another commented.
Another commented: “This is an interesting ad targeting mothers who need to suck milk (usually at work or in the toilet) and they feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or evaluates the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women revealed that they had danced with the pump hidden in their underwear.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the fact that many women who suck milk to breastfeed say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie breast pump makes no noise, does not have wires or tubes and sits discreetly inside a breast-feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold the baby, and even go outside while they are sucking milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: “The Elvie Dairy Suction Machine is truly a revolutionary product that deserves a bold introduction and encourages curiosity.
When comparing women to dairy cows, we want people to know about dairy products and related challenges, while at the same time expressing in a hilarious and empathetic way the freedom that new dairy products bring to mothers.
This isn’t the first time the Elvie breast pump has appeared in newspaper headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on designer Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has spiked even though the monthly number of people crossing the border has remained largely unchanged, in part because the harsh arguments and policies put forward by the Trump administration have made the process of bringing children to donors even more difficult.
Traditionally, most donors have been undocumented immigrants, and they worry that accepting an immigrant child could affect their ability to stay in the United States.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential donors and other adult members of their families would have to take fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of applicants for grants to unguarded minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had never had a criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of donors or family members are here illegally, and most of them already have criminal records.
So we are continuing to try these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to quickly handle cases involving these children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some donors to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, according to previous standards.
Many will appear through video conference calls, rather than being in person, to make excuses about their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for sponsorship will be deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more anxious or depressed they become, which can lead to violent behavior or attempts to escape, according to staff at refugee camps and systemic reports in recent months.
Supporters say concerns are growing at a larger facility like Tornillo, where they see a struggling child more likely to be ignored due to the size of the camp being too large.
They added that taking children to a city with refugee camps without giving them enough time to prepare or say goodbye to friends could hurt the mentality that many children are suffering from.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupied forces’ to withdraw from the country immediately
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their countries, even though the civil war has already entered its eighth year.
Moualem, the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had been on illegal Syrian soil, in the name of anti-terrorist forces, so "will be dealt with".
“They must withdraw from Syria unconditionally and immediately,” he told the council.
Moualem stressed that the “war on terror in Syria is nearing its end,” with more than 360,000 people dead since 2011, with millions fleeing their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “fighting in this jihad until we purge terrorist groups from the entire Syrian territory” and “the illegal presence of foreign forces”.
The United States currently has about 2,000 troops in Syria, specializing in training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 infantry in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions in the former country were good enough for them to return, and he blamed “some Western countries” for “spreading irrational fears” that kept refugees from returning.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to create conditions for refugees to return," he said.
“They are using political cards for humanitarian issues.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in Idlib’s last rebel zone created an opportunity to spur political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem said the agreement had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which includes the government and opposition members, to draft the post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the commission, saying the committee’s work was limited to “consider the provisions of the current constitution” and warned against meddling in elections.
Why Trump will win a second term
Logically, Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless the impeachment process and scandals end his presidency ahead of time, as liberals are hoping.
This is, of course, “The most dramatic of a presidential term!”
So far, there have been no signs of cooling.
Since 2014, the viewership rate has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News now has 2.4 million viewers at the Golden Hour, compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” topped the cable TV chart with more than 3.5 million viewers watching key news spots.
“Although not understood, many people are still drawn to themselves as cremators,” said Neal Baer, who runs ABC’s “Designated Survivor” television show, about a cabinet secretary becoming president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: and Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
You asked why?
“He said, ‘Because he made me laugh,’” Ms. Scovell told me.
This is interesting in the context of chaos.
Of course, unlike what happened on TV, any move by Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or the reunion of immigrant families and the global economic situation.
Only some television viewers have the privilege of choosing their own channel.
Not only that, but it’s even more appealing than the news section as you spend six hours watching a panel of experts debating the use of Bob Woodward’s “in-depth” source of information in Paul Manafort’s “Fear,” or $15,000 ostrich bomber jacket (“a glamorous outfit,” the Washington Post wrote) and the hints in the president’s over-scissions on Stormsions.
I changed my mind about Super Mario.
“One of the things he does is always bring you something new every night that makes it look like a reality TV show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of “Pawn Stars” when it comes to the cast and the unexpected happenings of Trump’s daily TV show (such as fighting N.F.L. or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t miss an episode or you won’t catch up on the trend.
This week I had a conversation with Fleiss, outside the house on the north bank of Kauai under 80-degree heat, but he hid inside the house to watch MSNBC while filming for CNN.
He couldn’t leave the television screen, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was presenting the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was on the scale.
“I remember the days when we were doing those crazy programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Outside money poured into the most intense midterm elections for the race for the White House.
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district is witnessing a cash rain, as the rearrangement of the congressional district has prompted two incumbents to race for the same seats.
The recent geopolitical rearrangement in Pittsburg County knocked out Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is racing against Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who now represents the former 12th District in Pennsylvania, which shares multiple boundaries with the new 17th District.
The map was rescheduled after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were rigged in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th arrondissement became a financial race between the party's main sponsors, the Democratic Committee on the Congressional Campaign (DCCC) and the Republican Committee on the National Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb was a household name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the popular March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th District Congressional District.
The position previously belonged to the Republican Party for more than a decade and President Donald Trump has won 20 points in the county.
Political commentators rated the Democrats higher.
The U.S. has considered sanctions against El Salvador for supporting China, but has since withdrawn
Diplomats found the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing and Washington had little to no objection.
Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and the president once owned a hotel in Panama until business partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "recent decisions about not recognizing Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the penalty is only considered for El Salvador, which received $140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, including cuts to financial aid and visa restrictions on some subjects, would be huge losses for the Central American country that now has high unemployment and crime rates.
As internal meetings unfold, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economics to reorganize a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior officials had announced that they wanted to continue the conference, helping to end the U.S. sanctions considerations for El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is currently scheduled to speak at the conference, scheduled for mid-October, when there are signs of taking administrative measures.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without a hard message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their information was corroborated by an outside analyst with close ties to the authorities and also spoke anonymously.
Research History
The next bomb could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s obstruction of justice, which now has plenty of evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is shifting his investigation to the issue of collusion between President Trump and Russia in the presidential election.
If there is a change in the party in Congress, President Trump will face difficulties in Congress, just before the campaign starts, and even with people from the same party.
There are a lot of issues, I don’t mean to mention that President Trump’s departure is inevitable – just like his counterparts in Europe.
All sides of the Atlantic need to make choices and this will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if the West also agreed to oppose and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and missed the opportunity to avoid years of carnage.
History revolves around such milestones, and the democratic party’s intransigence struggles will either increase or delay.
Americans have to deal with some of these challenges.
What happens if President Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been sitting in the bonfire since it was reported last year that he was proposing secret recordings of the president's wiretapping and speculation that the president was not fit for office.
Rosenstein said the Times' report was inaccurate.
“How will we react if the new F.B.I. investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair – or if you certify to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
Most of all, will we vote midterm for a Congress so that the agency will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these challenges, democracy will lose power for a long time.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I had a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak of Jewish descent who had been deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had occupied our home.
She survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, gave me the opportunity to light candles on the altar during the Sabbath.
With my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

The optimism of Graham Dorrans of the Ranger team ahead of the clash with Rapid Vienna
Rangers played against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, would give them an advantage to qualify for the Group G of the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard for more amazing things.
"It's a good thing for us because Villarreal is a strong team," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game with the confidence that we would get a point.
We could have won at the end of the game but the draw was not a bad result.
They probably played better in the first half but we counterattacked in the second half and had a better form.
Next Thursday will be an important game in Europe.
“Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough match because they have had good results in the previous game, but with the backing of the fans, I’m sure we can get through and get good results.
Last year was a difficult period, I had injuries and changes at the club but at the moment I have a very good feeling.
The team is good, the players have good form and good training quality.
Hopefully we can continue to go deeper to reap a successful new season.”
Women Are Worrying Too Much to Lose Sleep Due to Retirement Savings Problems
Despite the fact that the survey participants were well aware of what they were interested in, few spoke with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they had spoken with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, Nationwide’s vice president of life insurance business.
Here are the steps to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for them to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes first.
Talk with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as those choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a payment method for those expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care purposes may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or buying insurance on your own with your own money – as long as you have the money.
Careful preparation of legal documents: Avoid possible legal battles.
A health care plan is available so that you can appoint a trusted individual who oversees the medical care process and ensures that the professionals comply with your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also, consider authorizing your financial account.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure to pay your bills if you can’t afford it.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your parents have a medical emergency and are on their way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
List those details so you’re always ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about doctors,” Martin asked.
“What drugs are there?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have you made a plan yet?”
Man shot multiple times with rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a rifle on his way home during the night.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arms.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a “spontaneous act.”
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police called for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise.
Contact was cut off, and aid workers were unable to receive any information from the Donggala government, an area north of Palu close to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some of the main facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a fjord on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city is celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a capital that extends over 300 km (180 mi) along the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The capital, an administrative area administered by the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are two key sectors of the economy in Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also an important industry here, but is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by the tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of whom were in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami to hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurs near the city of Padang, the capital of eastern Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hits one of the islands in Mentawai, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami as high as 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake strikes the capital Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing damage and panic as people recall the devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The quake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed as the buildings collapsed.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly concentrated in the north of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, meddling in a report of domestic violence and opposing an arrest warrant, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Government Police.
According to police reports, when a woman tried to call the police to report the crime, he grabbed the phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su and must file a $500 unsecured bail, according to the KTUU report.
He appeared in court on Saturday, claiming he was “certainly not guilty” of being asked to defend, according to the report.
Palin faces three A-list charges, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with light class B, spent a day in prison and fined $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently taking place at the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, meddling in reports of domestic violence, and possessing weapons in a state of unconsciousness in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD after serving in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
The video is being posted on social media showing the timing of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck.
Federal prosecutors are proposing the death penalty for suspected NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are proposing the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that has killed eight people – a rare penalty that has not been carried out in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on Oct. 10.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily injury, according to a statement on the proposal for the death penalty, which was filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges can be sentenced to death, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of attempted murder, often used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “meticulous planning and pre-station,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov performed as “brutal, ruthless and inhuman”.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, harm and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian," the court said in a statement.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York executed the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple executed after they were convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by electric chairs on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he was doing, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on the phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang ISIS flags in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal defense lawyers representing Saipov, said they were "completely disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We think that the decision to carry out the death penalty instead of accepting a confession to a life sentence without the possibility of release will only extend the vulnerability of the event to those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to give the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say NIGEL FARAGE must take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people" during a rally at a conservative party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the heat" from European Skeptics - as one of Prime Minister Theresa May's MPs has suggested he should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Conservative party supporter Peter Bone said during a rally in Birmingham that the UK “has been out of the coalition” now if Farage is Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces as she tries to reconcile deep divisions between Conservative MPs, in favor of staying in the European Union, has joined a protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to stick to a compromise plan between attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of stay and the European Union.
The allies insisted she would push forward by trying to reach a deal with Brussels despite the backlash – and force European skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her plans and the “current state of chaos.”
Bone said during the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "oppose the Chequers plan".
He suggested Farage should be in the Senate and take responsibility for talks with Brussels.
“If he were the one responsible, now we would probably be out of the alliance,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit but we need to oppose the Chequers plan.”
He testified to his opposition to the European Union: “We do not fight in world wars to submit to others.
We want to build our own laws.”
Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the coalition is completely false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, telling reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Not many people approve of the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for this plan, which usually does not happen to our party, our activists, who are willing to call for the support of the people and vote for us in the first place.
Give up on Chequers and listen to the people.”
In a message to May, she added: "Prime Ministers hold their seats when they keep their promises to the people."
Farage said politicians must join the protests to "feel the heat" if they change the decision taken during the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to give up Brexit and we’re here today to say ‘we’re not going to let you do that’.
In a message to supporters, he added: “I want to let the political class, who are intent on changing Brexit, feel the heat of the current situation.
“We are mobilizing the people who have won Brexit and we will never surrender until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the stay marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists held up Conservative Party banners against Brexit after debuting the group this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives over the security issues they were facing as the conference opened.
“These are people who have told us that they can control the IT system and all the technologies that provide Canada, including the issue of borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete joke.
Brexit is not a good thing,” he added.
Warren intends to ‘elect’ the presidency
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be determined to "elect the president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future while speaking at the town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a permanent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, in a race with GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who served as the co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
People speculate that she could take over Trump’s position in 2020.
Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since Trump took office.
A participant asked her about her intention to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for “women to get involved in politics to reform the government and to have a woman at the top.”
Arrested in shooting of LSU player Sims
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect had been arrested in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died," Sheriff Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, on the sports channel 247.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene, possessing weapons and confessing to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a 1.98-metre-tall teenager and growing up at Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 games in the official squad last season with an average play time of 17.4 minutes, winning 5.6 points and 2.9 times per game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton won the world championship after winning against Sebastian Vettel
Valtteri Bottas clearly had an advantage over Lewis Hamilton on Saturday as Mercedes remained a strong team in the season.
From the starting point, Bottas had a good start and consecutively overtook Hamilton to defend his place in the first two laps and caused Vettel to fight his own team-mates.
Vettel entered the first pit and abandoned Hamilton upon re-entering the track, a decisive act.
The Mercedes entered the pit after Vettel, but Hamilton was ahead as the driver on the Ferrari was forced to slow down to avoid risk after two stages to defend the third place.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the race and finished seventh at the end of the first leg on his 21st birthday.
He then took the lead throughout the race by not changing his tires to a quick finish and bypassed Kimi Raikkonen to take fourth place.
He eventually entered the pit in the 44th round but was unable to speed up the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a tough race because Valtteri played so well over the weekend and it was a really good racer.
In the end the team had an excellent race to win the first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It's a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianne Feinstein at the campaign rally on Saturday for insisting that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford about the Supreme Court’s allegations of Brett Kavanaugh being sexually assaulted.
Speaking during the West Virginia campaign, the president did not directly target Ford's announcement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was happening in the Senate showed people were "bad and dishonest."
“It’s happened and what’s been going on in the last few days in the Senate is amazing, you can feel the anger, you can see people who are angry, bad and nasty and dishonest,” he said.
“When they watch the articles and read the leaked news, they say, ‘Oh, I’m not the one who did it.
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, you leaked the news, right?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document right-- "hey, what's going on?
No, no.
I didn't leak."
Come on, wait a minute.
We did the leak... No, we didn’t do it,” the president parodied the senator’s words.
Feinstein was sent by Ford in a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July and the information was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that her office leaked the information.
“I didn’t hide the allegations made by Dr. Ford, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it as she asked.”
But the president seemed unhappy about her refusal and he commented during the campaign Saturday night: “I’ll tell you about that, it’s really very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused by three women of sexual abuse, the president said Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power in every way.
You’ll see the meaning and discomfort because they don’t care who hurts, they want power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars won 5-3 over Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday’s loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League by winning 5-3 on Saturday at Dundee.
The Giants scored two goals early thanks to the goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized for the team before Dwyer scored extra points for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard went on to equalize Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals to help the team win the final.
It was the third defeat of the team’s Elite League season led by Adam Keefe, who defeated Dundee 2–1 in the match played in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth encounter between the two sides this season, and the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwy's opening goal in the fourth minute as the clock was only 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull and David Rutherford also helped Beauvillier double the goal off just four minutes later.
In the early minutes, Sullivan helped the home team shorten the score in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt became the player who helped Cownie level the score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first half when scoring the second goal at the end of the round.
The home team convened and Bouchard again leveled the score with a spectacular score in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee in the match at the end of the second half and he scored a fifth goal for his team in the final minutes of the match.
The Giants have lost four of their last five games, currently resting to await their next match against Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controllers have sacrificed their lives to save hundreds of passengers on board from the quake
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are being hailed as a hero after sacrificing to ensure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers can take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many went missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to rage in the area and many are trapped in the rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that the aircraft carrying the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
He then jumped out of the air traffic control tower because he thought it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved lives, according to Australian newspaper ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he stopped breathing before the plane reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we receive this news,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, a spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency said it was difficult to reach the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“The death toll continues to rise as many bodies remain trapped under the rubble and we have yet to reach many,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves as high as six meters have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military aircraft and commercial aircraft provide supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries the bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to support the survivors but we don’t know what the situation is like there.
This is a tragedy, but the situation could get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I wish you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, including more than 550 deaths.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says a man is still missing after plane crash at sea
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia, said one man was missing, following earlier statements that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that, until Saturday afternoon, we were unable to find a male passenger.
The airline said it worked with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about passengers, such as their age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events have not been clearly identified.
Air and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed at sea shortly after leaving the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane was missing the runway.
US passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was at a very low altitude.
“This is a good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others could wade through the waist-deep waters to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said flight attendants panicked and screamed, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby while repairing the wharf also helped rescue by using floatboats to pick up people on shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Data from the aviation safety net shows that 111 people have died in accidents caused by airlines registered in the PNG network in the past two decades, but none have been linked to Air Niugini.
Analysts say the time on the night the girl was burned alive
The plaintiff was based on Saturday’s files during a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified in court for hours as an intelligence analyst.
He demonstrated to the jury how to use the mobile record to sum up the movement of 21-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from a number of mobile phones indicating that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous statement, Clarion Ledger reported.
The data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambers’s phone during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was interrogated by police.
Sanford testified in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lies because my truck is in Nashville.”
Another inconsistent detail was Tellis who said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile phone records show they only knew each other for about a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and communications from his phone.
“He removed you from his life,” Hale said.
The defense attorney is expected to begin the closed-door debate on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury’s trial that day.
High Breed Group: What is positive hip hop?
The trio of hip hop artists wanted to oppose the negative views of the genre by putting positive messages into their music.
The High Breed group, from Bristol, claimed hip hop was no longer communicating political messages and solving social problems.
The group wanted to bring this genre to the right origins and re-populate positive hip hop music.
Artists such as the Fugees Group and Common have recently gained more fame in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
New York woman sues couple who fired her after 'racist' message
A New York nanny sued a couple who fired her for discrimination after she accidentally received a wrong message from her mother complaining that she was "a black man."
The couple rejected them as racists, treating the lawsuit as a “extortion case.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her frustration when she discovered the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,” Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the confusion, Plasco-Flaxman "unpleasant" fired Maurice, who said that the African nanny about to quit her job had done a bad job and that she hoped to have a Filipino nanny, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid by day and took Uber home on her own.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for a $350 a day compensation over a six-month period for the job she was hired to get the money even though they didn’t sign any contracts between them.
“I want to show them, look, you can’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple objected to allegations that they were racists, saying it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment for fear that they could not trust her after having insulted her.
“My wife sent her a message she didn’t intend to send.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“But can you give your child to someone you offended, even by mistake?
What about the new baby?
Tell me."
When comparing the case to a "blackmail" case, Plasco said that his wife had given birth to a baby for two months and was in a "very difficult situation."
“How would you deal with someone like that?
This is not a thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While the legal case was ongoing, public opinion quickly pointed its nose at the couple on social media, disparaging their behavior and the logic of the story.
Publisher Paddington fears readers won’t be interested in the story of a talking bear, the letter said.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was widely accepted by readers, revealed in the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in someone else’s shoes when reading the book for the first time.
It’s great that we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
When talking about his father, a cinematographer for the BBC before being inspired to write a children’s book from a small toy bear, he was still feeling optimistic when his work was rejected, she shared further during the 60th anniversary celebration of the book’s publication, which was a “mixed sadness” after his death last year.
When talking about Paddington, she described him as “a very important member of our family,” adding that her father was quietly proud of his success.
“He’s a pretty quiet man, and he’s not an energetic person,” she said.
“But because Paddington really does exist for him, it’s almost like having a child and it’s been successful: you’re proud of them even if they don’t really exist.
I think you've looked at Paddington's behavior that way.
Although it was the product of his creativity and imagination, he always took a position for Paddington.”
My daughter passed away and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life in vain.
“I called Nad often to say that this was bad and she shouldn’t have suffered,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying she would stop breathing for two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll see you soon.
I will always be with you.
Doctors pumped the heart medicine and slowly pulled the tube out of her body.
She stopped breathing a few times and this was the last time.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all this was not yet closed.
I can’t cry or scream or cry because I’m with my family and everyone else.
I have to be the one who binds them.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, still saddened by her daughter’s passing, boarded the plane with the other passengers, facing the challenge she would have to overcome.
“Nobody knows,” she said.
“I bowed my head and cried all the time.
It was hard to explain, but on the flight I felt pity for Nad.
He needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.”
Woman posts postcards to stop suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost suicidal relatives are trying to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people could call for support.
Davis’ son Tyler, then 13, had suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parents to be in that feeling that I have to go through every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a grin.
“Everybody knows about it because of the laughter.
They used to say his laughter lit up every room.”
However, he quit his job before committing suicide because he found himself “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother died after taking his own life.
Davis said: “I am constantly worried that there will be a chain reaction.”
Davis designed the cards, “to let people know that there are always people you can meet, talk to, or even make friends with.
Don’t live in silence – you need to talk.”
Humphreys, who had been a friend of Davies for many years, lost her partner Mark 15 years ago, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He’s not talking about feelings of boredom or disappointment or anything like that,” she says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed he changed his attitude.
“He’s in a bad mood at school on Christmas Day — when the kids open presents and he doesn’t care about them or anything.”
She said that her husband’s death was a huge loss for them, but they still had to try to get through: “This has caused a huge hole in our family.
It breaks our hearts.
But we all continue to live and fight with it.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is hanging out as the FBI begins its investigation
Flake said on Saturday that "I think if we can really get something like what he's asked for - a limited investigation in terms of time, limited in scope, we can gather a little bit," adding that he feared that the committees would "get involved" in partisan cases.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their procrastination is just a matter of time.
Midterm elections have gone through five weeks, on Nov. 6 — if expected, Republicans who are now in a very bad condition will be even weaker in their efforts to find the representative they want to elect to the highest office.
George W. Bush called senators and lobbied to support Kavanaugh, who served as White House aide under the Bush administration, and then had access to his wife Ashley, who served as Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases the reports?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes from the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, now vice president, to remove the knot and confirm his position in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans fleeing under Kim has plummeted.
The number of North Korean defectors has plummeted since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said last year there were 1,127 defections - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the large proportion of smugglers arrested were key factors of the change.
North Korea has not made public comments.
Most of the defectors from North Korea were eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most defectors fled through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and can easily cross the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two countries.
China considers the fugitives to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return.
Relations between North and South Korea – technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on denuclearization.
The moves come after a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, with both sides agreeing to extended terms to advance the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-Ho, blamed the U.S. sanctions for causing delays in progress.
“Without any confidence on the part of the United States, there would be no confidence in our national security and in such a case, there would be no way that we would unilaterally find our own disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh an "extremist," and says he's not fit for the position at the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi has called the nominee for the position in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, a "extremist" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview that took place Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help, but I think if a woman has ever done so then they would call it an ‘extremist,’” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh insisted on denying allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both minors.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh expressed a lot of emotion, at times when he almost cried out and was choked to talk about his family and five months of high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic Party in front of the committee, calling the charges against him an "well-planned assassination" over anger at Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he was unsuitable for the position in the Supreme Court, as he clearly showed behavior against the Democratic Party.
“I think he removed his own status when he made his statements and his treatment of the Clintons and the Democratic Party,” she said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would try to charge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democratic Party won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I would say this — if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only not at the Supreme Court but he’s going to have to testify to the court,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the appeals court in D.C.
Pelosi added, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s ability to make a ruling against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was seen as a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh evaded the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"This is not the time for a radical, biased person in court and hopefully we'll say, 'This isn't great,'" Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to take advantage.
This was really a heavy criticism, month after month, year after year the anger got bigger, and she couldn’t get over without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me after 45 years.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, and you?”
She went on, "I was helped a lot by a woman, she was the senior director, she said she cried too when she was angry but to form a reaction when she got angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And you keep crying.
And I think this is great.”
You are allowed to cry so that this behavior is part of the way out for rage because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my deepest memories of working at my first company was that it was a place just for men, I used to cry when there was a burst of anger, that was when an older woman — the cold manager who always scared me — pulled me up the stairs.
She said to me, “Never let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and happy because they’re with you.”
Patricia Schroeder, later a Democratic congresswoman in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught cheating on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Schroeder was deeply disappointed, arguing that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
30 years later she smiled and said to me, "It wasn't a wise decision."
“There have been seven other candidates in the race, and they need another one.
Some have called this race "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Due to her late involvement in the campaign, she lost the fundraising campaign, so she vowed that she would not run unless she raised $2 million.
The war has failed.
She found that some supporters gave her $250 instead of $1,000 in favor of the male candidate.
She asked herself, “Do they think I have a discount?”
When she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she overcame the emotion – expressing gratitude to those who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it more difficult for the fundraising process and targeted voters than delegates, she was angry at being sexist – that she was so excited she choked up.
“You might think I’ve had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled how the press had reacted to her.
“You thought Kleenex was the sponsor of my company.
I remember thinking about what they were going to put on my gravestone.
“Are you crying?”
U.S.-China trade war could be a good sign for Beijing
Experts say the opening lines of the trade war between the U.S. and China have stalled, and that the war will continue, the rift between countries could be an advantage for Beijing.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the US president, issued his first warning by levying tariffs on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Increasing escalation in recent weeks with tariffs worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) levied on half of Chinese goods imported into the United States.
Beijing retaliated by raising tariffs from five to ten percent to $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to retaliate in line with U.S. action, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to be shaken soon.
Getting Washington to make concessions means Beijing has to make demands, but publicly succumbing to the U.S. is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing can make the right moves, the long-term pressure of the trade war with the United States could be a positive signal for China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a political decision in Washington or in Beijing can both start an economic relationship in either country is actually far more dangerous than previously acknowledged,” Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research fellow at the Center for New American Security, said in a statement.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, Foreign Minister announces
Syria says it is ready for refugees to voluntarily return and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by the more than seven-year war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the national situation is more stable and safer thanks to advances in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to renovate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore living conditions
All current conditions are available for refugees to return voluntarily because they have left the country because of terrorism and economic conditions affecting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million other people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that the nation would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that finance the uprising.
Europe to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5–10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points in defeating the US team.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has participated in most of the tournaments, threw his shot into the water at his third spell at the 16th hole, admitting he lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of only four players to have won 5-0-0 since the current season began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5 & 4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world’s top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2–1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who may have played the last Ryder Cup match of his career.
A veteran player of eight Ryder Cup seasons, Sergio Garcia of Spain has become the greatest champion of all tournaments with a total of 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t stop it today.
This has been a really tough year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing and trusting me.
I am so happy to receive the cup.
About my team, I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said of the feeling after Europe’s victory.
He passed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who knocked out American legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“It’s proud to be able to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up and I admire him,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup tournaments.
The statistics of one of the greatest players of all time show that he has won 14 major trophies and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team did their best to find tickets for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were top players of the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of the players, they fought very well.
This morning we had difficulty with the high temperatures in Europe.
We were eliminated.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 players on the team played very well.
We will regroup, I will play the PGA in the United States and the Ryder Cup and we will continue to win the top of the group.
I love all 12 players and I’m proud to be captain.
I want to say hi to you guys.
We played very well.”
Update on Red Tide: Reduced Red Tide Density in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Association shows that the density of the Red Tide has decreased in much of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, algae blooming has been reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties – this causes red tide densities to decrease.
Red tides spread for about 130 miles along the northern coast of Pinellas to south of Lee County.
Small patches were also found within 10 miles off Hillsborough County, but fewer locations than last week.
Red tides were also observed in Pasco County.
Average coastal or offshore density of Pinellas County has been reported over the past week, low to high offshore density of Hillsborough County, low to high density of Manatee County, low to high offshore density of Sarasota County, low to high density of Charlotte County, low to high density of coastline or offshore in Lee County, and low density of Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory irritation has not been reported in northwestern Florida in the past week.
