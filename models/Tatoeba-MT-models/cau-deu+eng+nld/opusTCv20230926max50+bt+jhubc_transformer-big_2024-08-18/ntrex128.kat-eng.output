Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about "the similarity of the Dolls (muppet)"
Some members of the Assembly are seriously concerned about the proposal, with their current title being replaced by MWP (Manchess Parliament) in the name of MWP.
The problem was solved, as it is planned to change the name of the plugin.
There are a number of political parties in the country who have been able to make concessions to political correctness.
A Labour member of the Assembly says his group "will be inundated with Twp and Pwp."
No-no-well for readers: In Wales, twp means numerical twp, and in Wales ,pw k castings.
And one member of the Assembly said from Plaid Party that his team was "not happy" and presented several alternatives.
The Conservatives of Wales said they were "invented" to meet with a new name, but noticed that the word MWP was very similar to Muppet (British doll TV series in the UK).
In this case the letter w is used as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, currently working on the draft law on bringing the new name, says: "The final decision on the definition of the name of the Assembly members is, of course, the members themselves."
In 2017, the Welsh Assembly adopted the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission released the results of a public review of options, where it gained extensive support for the proposal to grant Parliament's name to the Assembly.
As for the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name "member of the Parliament of Wales", i.e. WPM but the MWP option received more support during public hearing.
Members of the Assembly are still choosing alternative options, so the achievement of consensus by the Chair, Elin John, would be of concern to submit the amendments to the bill in a matter of weeks.
The draft law also includes other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including the rules of disqualification of Assembly members and the system of committees.
Members of the Board of Directors will make a final decision on the status of the draft law.
Macedonians use the name of the country.
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to accept the country's new name "Republic of Northern Macedonia."
The vote was appointed due to the ongoing dispute with neighboring Greece for decades, as they also have a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that its northern neighbor, on this name, expresses its claim on its territories and is constantly in opposition to the establishment of its membership in the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia Giorgos Ivanov, an opponent of holding the plebiscite of the name change, said he would not pay attention to voting.
However, both sides, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, say the change of name is simply a fee for EU and NATO membership.
The calls of the Church of Martin were stopped because the churches in Harlem had difficulty in doing so.
"The people I spoke to say that there has been a bar and a church historically in all neighborhoods," Mr. Adams said.
“The day is no more”
He said it's clear that there are gaps.
"Today, people are interacting in a different way," he said.
"Battles are no longer a place of gathering of precincts, where their neighbors are constantly walking."
As for the churches, she fears that the money they received from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders suggest "and sooner or later they will return to the place from where they started."
Churches can be replaced by cooperative housing buildings, in which people will be accommodated who will not take care of the nearby temples, he added.
"The vast majority of the cooperative owners of these buildings will be white," he said, "so they will accelerate on the day when all these churches will be closed, because these cooperative buildings will not become crowded."
Both churches were built to serve white parishes until Harlem became the Blacks' metropolitans, the Civil Society Church in 1870 and the decade after St. Martin.
The original white method assembly was moved from the 1930s to the 1930s.
At the same time, the pilgrims of the skeleton had been given the right to protest.
The Church of St. Martin won the Black Congress by led by John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of Harlem's main trading district, 125th Street, against traders who refused to hire and encourage black people.
1939 Part of the fire building greatly damaged the building, but as the restoration plan was drafted by the father of Johnson's parish, the callers were called.
worthy David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to this Caribbeann, proudly called "recreating the calls of the poor."
In July, Carillion's artist named him "Cultural Treasure" and "An Unknown Historical Instrument."
Tiffany Ng, an expert from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was Dionysio A. Linde, the world's first black musician, who moved to the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr Meriter said the Church of St. Martin did not change it.
In the last months of St. Martin's Church, which was a difficult inconvenience by architects and contractors, part of the church's capellan assistants to the rest Bishop's Diocese were brought in.
The Church Council - the parish governing body of the Church, consisting of assistants of Capelani - was sent to the Diocese in July with an regret that the Diocese was "laying costs" for the ecclesiastical council, although the latter was not involved in the hireing of architects and contractors sent by the Diocese.
In a statement, the group said it was in a state of flux due to a lack of access to the perimeter.
A 13-year-old shark sculpted a 13-year-old killer in California
On Saturday, on the eve of the Feast of the Cancer Season in California, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who cried to collect the crabs.
The attack took place around 7:00 a.m., near the Shukura beach.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning for half an hour after he heard the screaming of the boy who asked for help and quickly swam out of the water with his friends to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was a scream of crabs, but then he realized that he was shouting!
"Shut up!"
When I came back, I saw that the man had a huge crush on me," Hamlet said.
"If everyone came out of the water, I would say, 'A shark is in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was taken to a helicopter in San Diego Radis Hospital, where his condition was critical.
It's not known what kind of squirrel was killed.
Larry Gilles, captain of the rescuers, said at a press-conference that shark was spotted in these areas a few weeks ago, but said that sharks of this species were not dangerous.
Gilles added that the victim has traumatic injuries at the upper part of the body.
Police have banned for investigation and security purposes for 48 hours on the beach from Pasadena's Ponto Beach to drinking Ecintasis in the beach.
Jill noted that more than 135 species of sharks are present in these areas, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
In contrast to Sainsbury's customers Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams, we offer a range of cosmetic products, which are available on the shelves of a supermarket warehouse and to help specialists in the area.
The 2.8 billion-pound sterling market for cosmetic products continues to grow, while sales of clothing and household products are down, the main disadvantageous element of the attack on such market is the cosmetic products provided on similar supermarket shelves, and in case of success there will be more stores in the country next year.
Investing in cosmetics is done as supermarkets hunt on the shelf spaces used once for televisions, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the list of more than 3,000 brands offered by cosmetics, including brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Already existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will become even more diverse in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket re-starts the sale of its Boutique makeup products, which do not contain products of animal origin and will be acceptable for vegans, the demand for young customers on such products increases rapidly.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will be tested in two markets in Sainsbury's, one of which opened last week in southern London, Croydon, and at the end of the second year it will open in Birmingham's Sele Oak.
Online shopping and in small shops on a daily basis with little to no food, the transition trend for supermarket owners makes it harder for them to work to get visitors.
Mike Cook, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, says the autiles will be very similar to the universals because supermarket networks are trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl with a frequent discount offer of more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has included hundreds of Argos auctions in the supermarkets, and has worked with lots of Habitats two years ago since the sale of these two networks, thereby improving the sales and purchases of food.
The supermarket's previous attempt to transform its departments of cosmetics and pharmacy was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but could not agree how to divide the revenue earned from its supermarket pharmacies.
Sainsbury's launched a new strategy three years ago from selling the Lloyds Pharmacy network to Celesio with 125 million pounds of pharmacy.
Lloyds has to play their role in this plan by expanding even more skin care brands with precious brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hiks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, says: “We have changed our way of life and we have met our customers with a cosmetic means.
In addition, they are also available to help with well-prepared projects.
Our list of brands meets all the requirements, and our attractive environment and convenient location through shopping in an old way has a serious competition."
Peter Jones “failed” by Hallie Wilson to cut <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, a lead television host, stopped his <0xC2><0xA3>11 million business contract with Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
There's no time like home for home-made clothing and accessories for their brand Truly.
The couple's business was linked to the Petilroy brand Goop.
The 37-year-old announced on Instagram today that he will be leaving.
Hallyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy when her last minute left their lifestyle brand-brand brand-y business, Marks <0x26> Spencer and ITV.
The source says Jones was "offensive" when at the Malawian Headquarters in Bakinghamshire on Tuesday, his business empire's Malawian Business Empire, a gold-minus-owned company, said the new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million deal did not give up time to participate in their home clothing and accessories brand's Truly.
The business is linked to the Petrou brand Goop and hopes to double the Ulyab affair of about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Wallaby, 37, announced via Instagram that he was leaving Trudy, Jones was leaving Britain for one of his summer villas.
Source says: “Truly Hall was a top priority.
This is what it was like for the next ten years to come.
The decision to remove all of this was entirely up to those who took part in it.
No one knows what happened on Monday, but it was so close to the start.
The company's headquarters are open to purchases."
Experts suggest the departure of this morning's lead, which is expected to cost Britain one of the highest-grossing celebrities, would cost the firm millions as solid investments were put into pads and plugs from candles to clothes and pyjamos as well as the possibility of a postponement of their release.
It will also be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three children Willaby and his wife, Dan Baldwin Jones and his wife Tara Cap have been close friends of each other for over ten years.
Wilab started with Trudy Cap in 2016, and in March, Jones, 52, joined them as chairman.
In addition to holding couples together for the holidays, Jones holds 40 percent stake in the firm of Baldwin's television production.
As an M<0x26>S brand ambassador, I'm a Celebrity will replace Saint McPartney with the ITV show's I'm A Celebrity.
The source close to John last night said, "We won't comment on his business activity."
"We fell in love after a difficult conversation"
He joked that news media outlets criticised him, some considered him a "non-presidential" comment, and also did not tolerate such a positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
Why is it that the President's inauguration is so high?
Trump said in a media-sounding voice.
"I don't give anything."
He noted that to take a big step toward the denuclearization of North Korea, Trump met in Singapore in June after his first meeting in Singapore.
However, the disintegration of the negotiations took place.
In June, three months after a meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Re Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North doesn't see "a corresponding response" to North Korea's disarmament actions.
Instead, he added that the United States continues to impose sanctions that aim to keep tensions.
The wording was much more powerful.
"Our affairs are doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“The war with North Korea is expected
Millions of people died.
"Now we have an excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to correct Kim's relationship had positive consequences - completing the missile test, assisting hostages and returning home the rest of the American service.
He also shared his story about his relationship with Kim.
"Presidential behavior is very easy, but instead of tens of 10,000 people trying to get through the arena, we have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of them.
In Indonesia, a tsunami and earthquake destroyed the island, killing hundreds of people.
To determine the results of the Lomboki earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
While 10 percent of the population of Lombok is dislodged, the National Disaster has not been declared, a precondition for the accelerated international aid.
“In many cases, they have been very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, which is a bit of an understated,” said Ms. Sumbon.
While Save the Children is already preparing the team for a trip to Palau, there is still no word on whether foreign employees will work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a press secretary for the National Disaster Service, said Indonesia's state agencies appreciated the situation in Palau to determine whether international agencies should allow it to enter into aid activities.
If we take into account the frequency of earthquakes occurring in Indonesia, we can say that the country is completely unprepared for natural disasters.
In this case, you'll find a lot of tsunami shelters, but you won't find them in other regions.
As it turned out, the tsunami warning alarm did not exist in Palau, although it was known that it was one of the reasons for the high number of deaths.
Traveling between many islands in Indonesia is actually quite difficult.
Natural cartilage is even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was put up for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake in Lomboki is traveling to Palau, but it will take three days to reach a new disaster.
President Joko Widodo placed a key place in his election program to improve Indonesia's broken infrastructure and lay lots of money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration has interfered with the funding issues, as he has re-election next year.
Joko also has a problem of confrontation between the confessions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are followers of the most conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and dozens of thousands of homes are slammed into clashes between Muslims, Muslims and Muslims through the streets, including mosques, children, and other weapons.

The number of victims of tsunami in Indonesia increased to 832
According to the National Disaster Service, the number of victims of earthquakes and tsunami in Indonesia rose to 832 on Sunday.
Many people fell into the ruins of the buildings on Friday when a magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused waves of 20 feet tall on Friday, a spokesman for the Service Sutopo Purvo said at a press conference.
The town of Palau, with a population of 380,000, is home to ruins.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man who was suspected of murdering a woman.
This morning in Birkenheim, a woman was arrested after finding her body in Mersaide.

"I also ask all taxi drivers, in particular taxi drivers, who may have been contacted by a video registrar, as this information could be vital for the investigation."
A police spokesman said a woman whose body had been found and found in a residential area.
The next morning, a group of friends, who had been in the hospital, told the police that they were going to meet him in the morning.
Police say they're trying to get the most out of the attacks.
The taxi driver, who lives in Miami, recently tried to get back into his apartment, but the police said no one had the right to enter or leave the building.
He couldn't say anything about what happened.
Residents said it would take a few hours before they were allowed to return to their homes.
The police officer told one man that the entire area is now considered a crime zone.

Construction of a new sanitary landfill in Adjara
Its eviction is a fictional punishment on many cultural and religious artifacts of England because of the Taliban invasion and destruction of breadwinners.
But the Cromwell Society calls Mr. Kryce's offer to be "stupid" and characterized as "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of Cromwell Society, said: “In the present debates, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s monument would be a target outside the Westminster Palace.
The struggle against traditional faith in the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out.
There may be some other croming punishable for the actions his predecessor Thomas committed in the last century.
The great work of Sir William Amorikroff is a wonderful proof of the 19th-century attitude towards Cromwell and is part of the history of the person, which, in many respects, is appreciated today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “It could be more in the second half of the 19th century than it is today, but still a lot of Cromwell consider it as an advocate for an outside pressure from a parliament outside the monarchy during the attack.
Historically, it's hard to tell how accurate the story is, but it's still happening.
One thing we can say for certain is that in the 17th century the conflict led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell was an important representative of one party in this division.
As a leader, he deserves recognition and honor as a leader."
Killer Pig Killed a Deadly Farmer in China
In the south-western China, a pig is attacked and killed by a farmer, according to local media.
A male with a damaged artery, found only in the genus "Yuan", was found in the market near the mouth of a pig on Sunday morning in Liumanjou Province of South China.
The pig is preparing vaccines for swine repellent poisoning in Chiang Mai, China, on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, she said, her neighbour, a resident of the Yunnan province, went to the market for 15 pork sales.
The next morning, his cousin found the deceased and noticed that the nearby pig's door was open.
He said that there was a large amount of blood on the floor.
The trial expert confirmed that 550 pounds of timber was broken and killed by a farmer, according to the report.
"The legs of my cousin were bloody and mutilated," said a cousin named Guiyang Evening News, referred to by the genus "Woo".
A security camera record shows how Yuan enters the market on Thursday at 4.40am to feed pigs.
They found her after about an hour.
An animal that killed Yuan does not belong to him or to his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs were locked apart to allow any further attack on the victim before the police collects material on the spot.
It is said that between Yuan's family and market leaders there are negotiations on compensation for his death.
It's rare, but the attack on a pig has occurred before.
In 2016, the pigs attacked a woman and her husband in their farm in Massachusetts, resulting in the man being severely injured.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound weight pig was dumped by a farmer in Wales before his fear of being shot by an animal by his wife.
When a biggie farmer ate a pig in 2012, one farmer told CBC News that pigs were not generally aggressive, but the blood taste could give them a boost.
"They just play.
Their sevens are very curious... They are not separated outside to harm you.
They just have to show respect to them," he said.
Hurricane Rosa is followed by large-scale heavy rains in the south of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will be followed in the coming days by flood-prone rains in the northern and southern regions of Mexico and the United States.
Rosa's storm surge reached 85 miles an hour at 5 a.m., this is a category of hurricanes on Sunday at 5 a.m. east time, and located 385 miles to the southeast of Mexico from Punta Eugenia.
Sunday's race to the north.
Meanwhile, a hurricane's thread begins to emerge over the Pacific, and it begins to move toward the east, the west coast of the United States. As the Rosa Baa Baa is approaching the California peninsula on Monday, heavy tropical storm is expected to pull its moisture towards the north, in the southern part of the United States.
On Monday, there will be 10 rains of rainfall in certain regions of Mexico.
Next, the tropical humidity in the coming days will form large-scale storms of rainfall in the southeastern region.
In places, between 1 and 4 inches of rainfall will lead to unearthed waterfalls, deforestations, and even cursed bears in most places.
Heavy tropical humidity will increase precipitation in 2-3 inches an hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rainfall is expected in the southern west, especially in most regions of Arizona.
Inflammatory flooding can be caused by a rapidly deteriorated rainfall due to the confused nature of tropical rain.
Especially reckless decision to go out and walk in the open space under the threat of heavy tropical rains.
With heavy rains, the canyons can be turned into raging rivers, and the steering wheel leads to strong winds and dust winds in places.
A nearby thread will cause a flooding of traffic in some parts of the southern California coast.
The total amount of precipitation is possible in half an inch, which will result in small rabies and traffic fields.
The first rainfall in this region will be in the presence of rainfall in the season.
The tropical rainfall in Arizona is nearing Sunday evening and Monday mornings, and on Mondays and Tuesdays the rain will be on a larger scale.
The heavy rains are expected to hit the ground running on Tuesday and will continue throughout Wednesday.
In October, temperature fluctuations in the United States are expected to occur as the Arctic becomes colder, but in the tropics are still quite hot.
Sometimes, it makes a difference in the temperature in the nearby areas.
An example of a dramatic change in temperature will be in the U.S. central part of the week.
The difference between the temperatures will be 20 degrees between Missouri Kansas City and Nebraska Omaha, as well as the attraction between Saint Luis and Demean.
Over the next few days, the warmth of the summer will continue to grow and expand.
The U.S. central and eastern regions of October's soft beginnings will be distributed at 80 degrees from South Plain to some parts of the North East region.
The temperature in New York City on Tuesday can reach 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term meteorological forecast for the first half of October shows a high probability of higher average temperatures in the east of the United States.
More than 20 million people have watched Brady Kavanaugh's interrogation.
More than 20 million people watched a spirited performance on Thursday at the highest court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accused of sexually abusing him in the 1980s, Kristin Blaz Ford in six television networks.
Meanwhile, political confrontation continued, broadcasters in the program stopped broadcasting programs for the change in the last seconds of Friday: the agreement was organized by an international senator Jeff Flack to conduct a one-week investigation.
Ford told the Senate's legal committee that he was 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh was drunk and tried to put his clothes on the party of high school students.
Kavano, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100 percent confident that this didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people have watched it, according to the Nielsen report published Friday.
The company was responsible for the media coverage of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
There was no immediate access to data from other networks that were also transmitted to it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen, as a rule, has a hard time figuring out the number of people who are watching programs in the offices.
To assess objectively, it's the number of people who watch football play or the Academy Award ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose experts are savvy for Kavanaugh's appointment, leads an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day among other channels, Nielsen said.
The ABC was estimated to have 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, 2.94 million NBC, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
After the hearing, there was a high interest.
It was the main character of the Saturday Night Live show.
The Republicans' office officially told the press after moderation that it would vote in favor of Cavano, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, when the opponents shouted at him to join the legal committee in an attempt to vote in the elevator.
It was only a few minutes before he arrived at the station, where he was greeted by CNN.
"I'm in front of you," said one woman.
“Do You Believe the Truth About the World?”
She said, "You have the power when so many women are powerless."
Fleyck said his office had released a statement and said that before the lift was closed, he could tell more about the committee's hearings.
Cable and broadcasting networks were broadcast live several hours later when the legal committee was given the candidacy of Kavano for the voting for the entire Senate.
But Fleming said he would do that only if the FBI could investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, which the Democrats said would be a minority of.
Fleik was partly convinced by his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Kane, in his speech.
After a few minutes, and then, with the help of a few others, Fletcher made the decision.
There was a choice of flutes, because it was obvious that the republicans would not vote for Kavano without investigation.
President Trump opened an investigation by the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanagh.
British Prime Minister has accused critics of Brexit "politics in the game"
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plan to quit the European Union in an interview with Sunday Times on Britain’s future “play of politics” and disregard of national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
While the interview was on the first page of the newspaper, a second interview was posted, where former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson pronounced his so-called Brexit deal, saying the goal was to collect tariffs on Britain and the European Union "absolutely absurd."
Eddie Sims: Police arrested suspect Daton Simpson in the murder of a LSU player
Police have arrested a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, who was suspected of shooting at Vede Sims.
Damon Simpson, 20 years old, is incarcerated and is in prison on the charges of second degree murder, Mr. Rouhani's police department said.
Authorities released a video showing the confrontation between sims and simpsons, police said they lost sight of sunglasses during a fight.
Police found sunglasses on the ground, and CBS branches of the WAFB said the DNA was found on the site.
After hearing the news, the police said it was clear that he had been arrested.
His cash commitment was determined by a $3500,000, says a lawyer.
On Friday, the Eastern President Ruiz's Parish Coroner office released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was damage in his head with weapons, in particular in the neck.
The department would like to thank Louisiana Police Crime Group, a criminal laboratory of state police, police officers at the University of Southern California and residents of the district for the investigation that resulted in the arrest of the perpetrator.
LSU Sports Director Joe Aleva expressed his gratitude to the region's law enforcement for their "good and consistent investigation."
Tom was 20 years old.
The 6 feet and 6 inches tall striker grew up in Mr Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball on the LSU team.
In the last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 assists in the game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Wil Vay, said the team was "defeated" and was "shock" due to Veed's death.
"You're always nervous about it," he said.
Vulcan’s ashes were drawn to Mexico City
The volcanic eruption of the Popokatepetl was called the southern districts of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, after the activity reached the crater, 183 gas and ashes were registered for 24 hours, the National Center for Disasters warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano.
The center has a lot of trees and grass.
On the pictures on social media there was a thin layer of ashes on the viscous glass of cars at Mekhiko City Hoshimilyko district.
Geophysicists (45 miles (72 km) from the capital to the south of the city have made an increase in volcano activities since the 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano named Don Goio is active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence referendum
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after clashes between pro-independence protestors and security police, thousands joined in a demonstration against the first anniversary of the polarized voting in Catalonia.
A group of separatists' masks were restrained by an order protective police, who shot eggs and loose paint, creating dust clouds in the streets, usually full of tourists.
The same day the police were involved in the attack where the handcuffs were used by the police.
For a few hours, supporters of independence sang "Don't Forget, Don't Forgive", which were harassed by pro-Unity protestants shouting "Long in Spain."
Some people have been arrested for minor injuries in protest, according to local press.
"Tensions still high in one year after a referendum held on October 1 by Madrid illegally in an attempt to seek independence in the region, Catalan separatists celebrate the anniversary.
A lot of people voted for independence, but more than half the opposition boycotted the referendum.
Catalan officials said about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the current referendum and clashes in the region's polling stations.
The pro-independent groups camped all night on Friday to prevent demonstrations and supported the national police.
The protests continued on with another round of protest.
Narciss Thermes, 68, was involved in a separatist protest along with his wife, saying he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had our best moments.
I looked at my parents crying with joy because they had the opportunity to vote for independence, but now we're stuck. "
Despite the victory achieved, even a small victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independent parties this year find it difficult to keep pace, as many of their well-known leaders either voluntarily left the country or are busy, and the court is awaiting a referendum due to their role and the announcement of independence.
Joan Poigi, a 42-year-old mechanic, is taking a mobile protest to support the police, saying the conflict was atrocities committed by politicians from both sides.
“Tensions are increasingly increasing,” he said.
Orioles Jeanc<0xC3><0xA1>r, one of the nine Catalan leaders arrested last year, said on Saturday that he intends to participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Europe's election is the best way to announce the desecration of democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
RICHARDS: A number of people have been arrested for driving a car into a house.
Three men, 33, 34, and 39 years old, were arrested after the car re-entered the house in London, London.
The incident occurred at Balinagar Crescent, on Thursday, about 19:30 BST.
As Dr. Balmings says, it's a waste of time, and it's built by itself.
It is possible that at some point in the car began shooting.
Manga Golf won a 1-0 victory against Livinston Ranger.
Doli Menga's first goal was to win Livington
Lyvinston previously pushed Reinger to be given to Steven Gergart in 18 games only due to his second loss as a manager of the Brooks Club.
Dolly Menga's Golf made a difference, with Harry Holt moving to a second level with Hiberian.
The team left the Premier League without winning this season, and then next week they meet with a leader holding a team that will be down by eight points.
In the meantime, Reynolds will return to the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Lyvingston continues his unbeaten move to Division 6, with the lead coach Holt still hasn't lost the match in the past month after changing Ken Miller.
The Red Sox didn't make use of the consoles.
Holti's team had to be promoted long before scoring a goal, their direct game created problems for Rangers in all zones.
Scott Robinson went well, but the front-runner hit the ball, then Alan Litgou could have hit the header along Craig Holkit's door just to reach the door.
The hosts were pleased to give the Ranger the opportunity to play in front of them, knowing that they would solve problems for guests after updating the game from standard situations.
And it was a tactic in which the decisive ball passed.
Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston worked at the opening ceremony, as well as Declan Galaher and Robinson united to give Menga a touch and scored a goal from the center of the penalty area.
At the time, Rangers had the advantage of possession of the ball, but defending the opponent was out of control, and goalkeeper Liam had no problems with Kelly.
It was the second half of the season, but Alfredo Morello knocked out the door and Kelly opened the door.
The goalkeeper of the Ranger shot by Scott Pittman has repelled Alan McGregor on foot, as well as Liwg<0xC3><0xB3>m from afar has been hit by another standard situation in Livingston.
There was holdings at the Livingston penalty area and the ball was always taken out of the penalty area, but two penalties were set - after replacing Holkit Glen with the metalton and playing with the other hand - both were vaccinated against the door.
"Phenomenal" from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland Alder Lamont on the macaroni Arena
It's a lynching game and outcome.
As an all-star player, he's always looking forward to the next big thing.
The style and composition of their game have changed significantly since they returned to the highest league, but it is very special thanks to Holt for incorporating the team after his arrival.
He had a lot of horses.
Captain Holkit was insensible, highly organized defense head, and Manna Conor Goldson and Joe Waral never gave a break.
In addition to this, the refs also have a tendency to overeat.
Sometimes they're too good to be true, but they're very good at this kind of stuff.
Their final ball was not scored - only once a team of hosts - the Rangers woke up, they found themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an Unification Meeting in Cologne
During a meeting with the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (29 September), there were lots of smiles and lots of blue skies.
It was the last day of President Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's controversial visit to Germany, the visit was aimed at improving relations between NATO member states.

This city is home to the largest number of tourists living outside the city.
The police blocked 25,000 people in front of a mosque for security, but still a large number of supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protestors, including many Kurds, have also tried to make their voices heard, criticized Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to convene his country.
A duel protest expresses a different attitude to the guest, the German Turks do it as a hero, the other is called Autocrat.

Eleanor Roosevelt: Six soldiers were killed in the line of duty
Six prison officers were injured during the upsurge in the arrest of senior security men, the prison officer said.
The riots started in Worcester HMP Long Larson prison on Sundays at around 9:30 p.m., BST and continue at this point as well.
Special officers of Tornado are called to solve the situation, involving eight prisoners and being held in one wing of the prison.
Doctors have found medical help in the area due to mild injuries of the face.
Prison press secretary said: “HMP Lang Lang Lang Lortney’s ongoing unrest processes involve specially trained personnel for prison.
Six employees have been found to be ill-treatment.
"We are not tolerated to violence in prison, we clearly say that offenders will be handed over to the police and will have to stay beyond the gyms for longer."
HMP Lounge has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
According to the report, in June, the prison staff needed hospital treatment, because they were incarcerated.
In October last year, security officers were called to put in jail to carry out serious sedition, during which employees were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Finn, Las Vegas, with sudden water drops in Salt Lake City (may also be useful in areas with water shortages)
Tropical depression rarely flares in Arizona, but at the beginning of the next week that's what happens as Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves west of the UDA, which is likely to lead to sudden aqueous flooding.
The National Weather Service has already announced sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona, South and East Nevada, South East California and Utah, as well as cities Finix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Solte Leak City.
It is expected that Roosevelt will take the lead in the direction of the fintech on Tuesday, the next Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix states that only "Ten tropical cyclone" could maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression 200 km away from the Phoenix 1950s!
"Catherine (1967) was a hurricane, 40 miles from the border of Arizona."
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center suggest 2 to 4 inch precipitation, insulated quantities from 6 inches to 6 inches in Arizona's Molodon Rim.
Other areas of Udaburi South-West, including the central rock and the grit in Basin are likely to be 1 or 2 inches, whereas the total insulated can be up to 4 inches.
For those who are at risk of sudden drop in waterfall, Rosa's rain can be useful because the region is very droughty.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some strong rains are likely to be useful as the South West is currently suffering from drought.
"Forty percent of Arizona's population is under extreme drought, the second highest category," he said.
Hurricane Rosa traces its trail to Mexico, Baia on the California peninsula.
Rosa, again with the hurricane power Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Puerto Eugenia, driving at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm interacts with the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and therefore calms.
Thus, in Mexico, the landslide is expected to be formed with the strength of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall can be a very strong warning of flooding.
"The total number of rainfall is expected in 3-6 inches of precipitation in Northern Western Sanora Bay, California, with rainfall up to 10 inches," weather.com says.
Rosa follows north through Mexico in the form of tropical rainfall before reaching the frontiers of Arizona in the morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression that then passes through Arizona and reaches South Utsa Tuesday in the late evening.
"The main threat expected from Rosa or its waste is very severe rain in the Northwestern Sonora's Bay of California and U.S. U.S. U.S. wild regions," the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and negroes in the desert, as well as landslides in the mountainous region.
Assassin's Creed: Unity was arrested for four counts of attempted murder.
A three-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man were arrested for killing a 16-year-old teenager with multiple wounds inflicted on his body.
A teenager was found on an elevated terrace in the area of Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition was "stable".
Police say the two 17-year-olds, 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested last night in the surroundings of Redstock.
The police came in and contacted anyone who could have access to the saw on any phone, what happened and what had taken place during the events.
As a result of the tyranny of the Democratic party, the party has become a symbol of democracy and freedom.
"The sound of Kavanaugh's voice is a dense and terrifying voice for the Democratic Party's condemnation of a brutal and terrifying tactics," Trump said at a rally in Wiling, West Virginia.
Trump said that the Kavanaugh influences and anger from a democratic party during the process of his nomination.
Before presenting a press conference on Thursday, Kavanaugh denied all the evidence given by Christina Blaise Ford, who sexually abused her ten years ago, while she was still a teenager.
Henrik also asked for the opinion.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw the beauty, quality, and purpose" from Kavanaugh.
"Every vote given to Cavanagh is a recognition of its voice as one of the greatest civil servants of our time, a fighter in the judicial space with the role of records and achievements of civil servants," he told supporters in West Virginia.
The President also talked about Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the situation of the Republican Party that they had during the interim elections.
"It's just five weeks away from the most important election in our lives.
I didn't really think I was going to die," he said.
"That's why I'm going to fight to the end with all of these great candidates."
Trump said that the current main mission of the Democrats is "retention and resistance."
The first procedure for voting Kavanaugh's nomination will be held no later than the next Friday at the Senate Hall, a GOP assistant said in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people died in an earthquake, tsunami, and huge rising waves in Indonesia.
State agencies said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed in a disaster and hit many huge waves while the tsunami and earthquake damaged the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands of people were gathered along the Palau coast on Friday, when the waves of a height of 6 meters (18 feet) hit the surroundings, destroying the lives of many people, and destroying everything that they had ever met before.
It was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami first appeared yesterday, people would not disappear and stay on the beach again and become victims of this catastrophe," a spokesman for the Indonesian organization Sutopuvo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta.
"In this case, there was no tsunami, he had to transport cars, wooden cars, houses and everything that he saw on the road," Nugroho said, noting that the tsunami would have been carried at a speed of 800 km / h (497 miles / h).
He said that even some of the trees were planted and that he was able to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 different centers in Palu.
Documentary footage posted by an emergency agency depicting numerous buildings, shops and bridges that have been sacrificed for this unfortunate accident were also shown a mosque surrounded by a large amount of water.
The events continued on Saturday night in the City of Los Angeles.
The earthquake had a population of 2.4 million people in the area.
The assessments and use of technology (BPPT) stated that energy generated during the disaster was 200 times greater than the events of the second world war in Hiroshima.
As for the geographic location of the city, it is located along the coast, which could be facilitated in the process of increasing the damage caused by the disaster.
Nugroho has named it as a "wide scale" and claimed thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and a hotel were sacrificed.
The bodies of the victims were found in the ruins of the ruined buildings, adding that 540 people were injured in an accident and 29 were still looking for them.
Nugroho also said the victims and losses could have been larger in Palau's northern areas, 300 kilometres (190 miles) from the city, in Dongala area, exactly where the earthquake epicenter was located.
Communication was "completely limited in the aspect of information transfer" between Dongala and other mediums, Nigroho said.
About 300,000 people live in the area," the Red Cross said, adding that their volunteers and employees were in charge of the event.
"It's been a long time coming, but it could have been worse," he said.
On Saturday the agency was under a lot of criticism for providing unconventional information about the disaster that took place in the city of Palau, officials said that the waves had spread to another city while the alarm message was still new.
On the content shared on social media, it is possible to see a man trying to warn the population on the roof about the approaching waves of the vote for them.
In just a few minutes, a huge stream of water was stopped at the beach and took the buildings and cars with them.
The time-honored media couldn't get the right information.
The earthquake and tsunami damaged the power supply between cities and made it impossible for officials to exchange information.
Soldiers started sending primary aid planes to Jakarta and other cities in the accident zone, but the victims still need food and other primary consumption items.
The city's airport will reopen only for emergency situations and return to normal working mode in October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the Palau evacuation center on Sunday.
In India, the tsunami has risen to more than 800.
That's very bad.
Mr Dodos said that when World Vision employees were traveling from Dongala to Palu, they had to see terrifying scenes and places before they reached specific areas dedicated to self-defense.
He said he saw "a lot of houses that were destroyed as a result of the disaster."
That's very bad.
Although many local rescue organizations have launched their activities and carried out various rescue activities or operations, several similar foreign organizations have been banned from entering the areas of Palau.
According to Indonesia's regulations, co-financing can be supported if assistance is available in the country only if it is recognized as an international disaster zone and acquires similar status.
It hasn't yet happened.
"There is still a low level of unrest in cases of unrest," said Alia Ariya, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government agrees that this is a national accident," we can receive international aid, but we have not yet received a notification about it.
After the Friday earthquake and tsunami of the second night, the friends and family of the missing still hoped their loved ones would survive again, and the dark traces left by the natural disaster would not remain forever in their lives.
On Saturday, the little boy was brought from a irrigation channel.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days, next to her mother's body.
The Indonesian paragliding coach trained two missing pilots in the disaster to compete in the upcoming Asian games planned in Indonesia.
Other people in the hotel are in the ruins of Rosa, and their students have been found.
"As a paragliding fly in experience, I have my emotional boundaries," he said.
Mr. Gendon stated how fast the events at Roja Roa's Hotel spread within just a few hours, with Paraplan flying to the public. He was desperate to send their messages to the recipients of their messages via WhatsApp, who attended the festival on the beach.
However, there was only one gray sign on his message, not two blues.
"I think it means that the message they didn't come," he said.
$26,750 was stolen from the bank's banknotes in Newport
According to a news team at the Newport Police Department on Friday, the thieves were able to pay $26,750 from the marine workers who were filling the bank machines at that time.
The driver cleaned up the ATM and was preparing a place for even more money, detective Denis Makharti said in the news.
When the driver was busy with his mission, the other "backed him to the border worker" and offered him a bag full of money, which should have happened.
Investigators have noted a number of suspects, who were involved in the process, but according to the report, police did not specify the number of outside people.
Anyone with information about the identity of the suspects should contact the police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The new name for the rapper is Ye
Ren<0xC3><0xA9> Keselowski changes his name to Y<0xC3><0xA9>.
On Saturday, he wrote on his Twitter account, "I am officially known as Kenny West."
The 41-year-old West's nickname for some time really was Ye, and he used it for his eighth album, which was released in June.
In addition, on Saturday's live show, Ken is expected to see a different visual, and here is the spread of his new album, Yandhi.
The company said it would replace Ariana Grande, who refused to come out due to the "emotional background."
In addition to the current professional name, which is a certain abbreviation for Ken, Vesti said the word has religious value.
"I believe 'yes' is the most frequently mentioned word in the Bible, and it bears your 'you' meaning," Ken said in this year's interview with Leading Big Boy on the radio.
"I am you, we are you.
From Kenye, which means only you, this name has been changed to Ye, our good, our bad, our unrest, and the reflection of everything.
"Album is more an attribute of who we are.
It is one of the well-known names that changed the name.
Sin Combs is known for their names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Daddy, but this year she said she prefers names like Love and Brother Love.

Mexico's AMOLO pledges to use force against civilians
Mexican President Andr<0xC3><0xA9>s Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has sworn not to use military force against civilians, marking the 50th anniversary of a bloody repression against students in Mexico.
Lopez Obrador promised the people at a meeting on Saturday in Tlatalloco Plaza that "he will never again use military force to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers attacked peaceful civilians in what claimed the lives of 300 left-wing people.
Lopez Obrador promised young people monthly subsidies and the opening of new public universities.
He said that the lack of employment and education leads young people to engage in crime in the criminal world.
The U.S. must invest in artificial intelligence.
Kai-fu Lee, inventor and artificial intelligence practitioner, with experience working in companies like Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that China is becoming more active in aspects of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its amount of money spent on research.
This comment was published after various parts of the U.S. government made statements on artificial intelligence, noting that the U.S. has no formal strategy formulated on this topic.
China announced its plan last year: it plans to become the No. 1 leading state by 2030.
"Doing research would be a good start for the U.S., given how many other countries are behind it, and we're looking forward to other new achievements," he said.
Domination of funds will further increase the likelihood that a new discovery will be in the U.S. by artificial intelligence, Lee said this week during an interview with CNBC.
Li, whose book The Superpower of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silk Road, and the New World Order, was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that invested in the organization of one of China's largest artificial intelligence superpowers.
In the 1980s, he worked on artificial intelligence systems that defeated America's highest-ranking players, Carnegie Mellon University, later becoming executive vice president of Microsoft Research and a Chinese branch of Google.
Lee Sympathia was articulated about technological competitions previously held by the U.S. government, such as defensive robots running in the direction of defense, and wondered when the next event would take place to make future prospects even better.
Li said that researchers in the U.S. often need a lot of work to get grants.
"No, we're not taking away the academic leadership; it's the corporations," he said.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies hire successful figures from universities to work with them in the field of artificial intelligence.
Li said immigration reform can also lead to the development of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically in the hands of people with a doctorate degree," he said.
China's State Consulate has announced the development plan of artificial intelligence for its next generation in July 2017.
Lee noted that the China Foundation for Natural Sciences is funded by scientists working in the educational institutions, as well as government agencies, and the US citizens can get this funding, but the degree of research is still lower than that of China.
Recently in the United States, the Department of Defense has set up the Center for Artificial Intelligence, the main goal of which is to unite people working in industrial and academic fields, while the White House has announced its readiness to form the committee for the formation of artificial intelligence and the election of its members.
DARPA has also announced a $2 billion investment that they are going to be implementing in the project called AI Next.
In addition, DAPRA invests 100 million people in artificial intelligence each year.
However, the U.S. legislative body, which requested a security committee for artificial intelligence, has not taken any step this month.
Macedonian citizens will take part in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, the Macedonians took part in a referendum where they expressed their desire to change the name of their country and become the "Republic of North Macedonia," a similar move to resolve a decade-long conflict between Macedonia and Greece, and which prevents Macedonia from entering the EU and NATO.
Greece, which is occupied by the province of Macedonia, said Macedonia had claimed on its behalf the territory of Greece and that Greece had vetoed Macedonia's NATO and EU accession process.
Representatives of the two countries agreed in July to change the name, but national opponents say such action would undermine the Slavic background of the Macedonians.
President Giorgi Ivanov has said he is not going to participate in the referendum, thus announcing a boycott and supporting those who are trying to undermine the 50 percent threshold.
The ballot paper presented in the referendum reads: "You want NATO and EU membership by agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, said that it was the price of the cost required to pay for EU and NATO membership, because Macedonia is one of the countries that have formed as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to speak for the future of the country, to voice for young people who will be able to live in peace under the curtain of the European Union, because it means a safer environment for all of us," said 79-year-old Oliver Georgievka, in Skopje.
Despite the lack of legal union, members of parliament said they would wait for the election results and observe if the votes became decisive for the country.
The change of the country's name requires more than two-thirds of the vote.
The board of directors said that no reports had been reported for an hour.
Nevertheless, only 16 percent of the population declared this time, which is significantly lower than the 2016 elections, where 34 percent of the population had already been declared and 66 percent finally recorded their opinion on the ballot.
"I have come here to voice my children here, our place in Europe," said Jos<0xC3><0xA9> Tanevski, 62, from the voting capital.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son, supported the change of name for Macedonia, which paved the way for NATO and the EU, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
At that time, in Skopje, ahead of the Parliament, Vladimir Kakadakov, 54 years old, was preparing a small scene, carrying chairs and placing them ahead of the tent, for those who opposed the referendum.
"We want NATO and the European Union, but we want to unify these organizations at the expense of helping others, not at the expense of helping others."
"We're a poor country, but we're proud of it.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can communicate with Russia and China and become members of the Euro-Asian Union."
Prime Minister Zayev said NATO integration would bring more benefits to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate is higher than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will make this choice, because 80 percent of the country supports NATO and the European Union," Zaev said while filling his ballot paper.
He said that "yes" would be a result that "confirms our future."
The survey, conducted Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Research, will involve between 30 and 43 percent of the population in a referendum that does not meet the requirements.
A second survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia said 57 percent of the population were planning to vote on Sunday.
About 70 percent of respondents are willing to give a positive answer.
In order to successfully complete a referendum, 50 percent plus one vote is required.
One of the biggest disadvantages of the pro-Western government is that they came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City footballer, Sergio Aguerreo manages to maneuver Briton's defense to score a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly played for Britons defending players during a match held at Etihad Stadium, Manchester, England and Manchester City, with a 2-0 victory.
The game's goal was a very simple one to score in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentine attacker received the ball in the middle of the field.
He split between three Britton defense players before he appeared in the open space.
After that, the aggro turned around between four green t-shirt players.
He was one of the defenders who had driven others to the edge of a meter of the edge of the line.
After that, he gave the ball away.
Sterling used the first touch to return the aguery of the ball, and Aguuero was able to score on the right foot for the Briggton's doorkeeper, Mateu Ryan, to score in the right corner of the grid of the goal.
"It's a matter of concern to the public," Peppa Pig told reporters.
"We're going to have to wait 55, 60 minutes for the game.
And that happened.
We were lucky he was able to make it to our destination at the moment."
However, they were able to get the blues to the advantage of the Premier League in the current championship.

You'll want to play Spoiler vs. Rockies
After the loss of a national flute, it wasn't so big that the idea was to put the roots into a new beginning.
But, there's always a competitive mixer to hope that his team will be able to win on Sunday, against Colorado Rockies, and only if the Rockies are still involved in the playoffs, and have a one-player advantage compared to the Western Confederation championship of Los Angeles.
On Friday night, Rockies was able to win 5-2 with the national tense game, but still want to withdraw their first title.
"Despite the fact that we are playing for nothing, we will at least be able to set a maximum pitch and to know that with the atmosphere and the opponent team created in Denver, it is possible to create the highest level of game that has been played in this year.
Why don't you want to participate in this kind of competition?
The Red Devils haven't been on the list for the week yet, but in this case, they're going to have to make a decision.
The 34th is the start, as it came out of Bulena on Thursday's game, which is why he will take the picker position for the week at the club.

President Almaty spoke of the events that occurred in the highest court around Bret Kavanaugh when he spoke about the situation of the Republican Party that they had in the mid-term elections.
"Everything we've done, we're going to do in November.
It's only five weeks away from the most important election in our lives.
"This is one of the biggest, biggest events -- I don't think I'm running, but I'm actually running, and that's why I'm trying to fight these great candidates at every place," he said.
Trump also added, "You're seeing terrible, terrible Democrats, and you're watching this for a second.
They try to regain power by using all their efforts, you can see this glossy and dirty.
"They don't care who they will hurt, the main thing is power and control, that's what they want, and we're not going to give them up."
He said the current main mission of the Democrats is "retention and resistance."
"And you see that in the last four days," she said, and responded to Democrats' "how angry, rude, and untrustworthy they are."
He also appealed to the Senate Judiciary Committee, the senator Diane Faintin, who has received a very noisy response from the attendees.
"Do you remember his response?"
Have you been exposed to official data?

The church doesn't leave the church.
It's so inconsistent with people who think what they're saying.
When I heard the voices of the activists driving my party, I was very surprised.
After all, I'm the last person on the Labour MP list that I don't want to accept - and that's all just because of what I think.
My parliamentarian colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar response as it came out in response to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement has given rise to criticism by Jeremy Corbyn because of disagreements with Corbyn.
Jeremy did not agree with the leaders on the same topics as the previous ones, such as handling responsible economic policy with the government's initial agencies, Europe and similar problems.
At a meeting with East Nottingham, a letter was sent to the attendees: "We would like to have a meeting inclusive and productive."
After eight years of being a local MP, this is how I met on Friday night.
Unfortunately, there is no such thing as a "good and polite" policy at this time.
It is quite clear that the Labour Party has an unhealthy attitude towards different opinions and each opinion is criticized only by the opinion of the party leaders, whether they agree with it or not.
It began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague he expected me to change my view on various issues and take a position that I would never agree on in my life, whether or not I would like to trade unilaterally with the EU.
When I speak publicly, you want to have all of this importance - on social media, there is quite a lot of violence at the request of early elections, at the request of the collapse of the political center and the departure of my party.
And that's not just my experience.
I have to admit, even though I'm a bit biased, that my political views are political.
I've talked to a colleague about the professionalism and effort they put in to listen to sexist and racist shouts on a daily basis, but they never escape.
In today's politics, it is unfortunate that such violence is normal for us.
In a statement last week, the White House said it had to establish a tradition of tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer like the Church, nor are we ever "unsustainable" a step or a change in the party's internal structure makes it even narrower.
Over the past two years I have received a lot of advice to be happy with, not raise a voice, and in such a case, "everything would be fine."
But that's not what I did in politics.
32 years ago, when I became a member of the Labour Party, and this decision was due to a policy set out by Thatcher set out in the classroom, I was aiming to serve them in the aspect of civil service who most need it - whether as a local or as a government minister.
I've never been to politics, even when it comes to politics.
No one in East Nottingham could have been confused about my political position and the differences I had with the ruling party at the time.
To those who thought of their Friday meeting to the top, the only thing I would like to say is that when your country is heading towards Brexit, which can damage real estate, business, and civil service, I don't understand why you should be willing to spend time and energy on such a loyal relationship with the leader of the Labour Party.
But one message I have, is not for Nottingham's members of the movement, but for my colleagues, labourers, and others: I am proud that I have the opportunity to serve you, and I promise that no threats or bad political intent can prevent me from doing anything that I believe serves your best interests.

Ezekiel 38:17 - RSV - In the Name of the King, He Was Abducted
The last two meetings could have had some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that Eiri deserved the triumphant victory that this team had achieved in the Tenente Premiere game today.
At the moment, they are at the top of the list of 10 teams, the only undefeated.
In the end, it was through their good protection and odds that the team was able to establish the dominant position at home, which is why they could have enjoyed coaching, Peter Marsh.
"For each game, we've tested opportunities, and we're still unsure, which is why I have to be happy," he said.
Robin Christie, from Melrose, said: "Honesty is air, and they've used the odds better than us."
At the 14th minute, the attempt by Grant Anderson, who was created by Fraser Climo, was preceded by Eire's team, but for the Scottish captain, the yellow card given to Horo Hughes, gave him a wide-ranging advantage and allowed Melrose and Jason Begoto to use the odds.
After that, Climax managed to increase the advantage of Eire through penalty, just before the end of the first half, and made the score 17-5.
Melrose started the second half quite well, which is why by Patrick Anderson's attempt and the Bagot finish, they were able to reduce their advantage to five points.
This was followed by a serious tragedy of Rurad Nott, who had to leave the field, but Eir was able to get away again and with the help of McDoval's services, climatic transformation took place.
Eyeri's active Captain Blair McFerson has won a yellow card again, as a result of which Melrose made an unsuccessful attempt to transform the players through the big pressing.
Players were able to turn the game around at home, and when Strawan Hachison deserved a yellow card to cut the climo, McPherson was able to land on Tachdaun and pull it off before Eir Maul.
Klim was able to score the ball and he managed it every time, after he sent a box of boxing to Gregor Hanris, five times at home for the players.
The TV series, a solid game star, is preparing to establish himself in a restaurant career.
The solid game star Ford Kiran is planning to move to the hospitality industry, and the story has spread since it emerged that he has been named a licensed restaurant manager.
56-year-old Jack Carvis plays the BBC's popular comedy series, in which he writes and collaborates with longtime comedy partner Greg Hampfield.
Duett said the series 9 is final for the series and it looks like Kirnani is going to make a variety of changes after the screening.
According to official sources, he is the ruler of Adrifmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but the Scottish source reports that Kinran intends to engage in the Glasgou trade industry.
'Sea of ours': Middle-aged Bolivia hopes the court will clear the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Riggin-Clear Division is patrolling in La Paz.
Blue flag flies at public institutions.
The following is a description of the sea from the sea to the Amazon: "The sea is ours."
It's our turn to get back on it."
The collapse of Bolivia's 19th Caucasian conflict, which ended with bloodshed against Chile, is what the conflict is all about: the Pacific Ocean.
Five years later, Bolivia faces the International Court of Justice (ICJ) decision to resign on October 1.
"Bolivia has momentum, a sense of unity and purity, and of course expects a positive response," said Roberto Calzadi, Bolivia's diplomat.
Plenty of Bolivians are airing live plans to march international court proceedings, and, of course, many believe that, after decades, Chile will be tasked to negotiate with the country and to give way to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic president, who looks forward to next year's elections, also makes sense for Monday's process.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he said last August.
But some analysts, however, believe that the chances of making decisions in favor of Bolivia are very low, and if the chances are right, they won't change much.
One of the centres of the United Nations in the Netherlands, established in the Netherlands, has no effect on the territory of Chile, saying that their intervention would have no effect on this negotiation.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) said the verdict would last six months, meaning the case was not "intended," Paz Zaratti, an expert at international law, said.
And to improve Bolivia's case, it may even be four years from now.
"The return of the boat to the sea was carried out by the Bolivian administration," Zarat said.
The mood of Bolivia's martial law may even drop Chile's last drop of beneficiary, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will start negotiations at a certain point in time, but they will continue to be very difficult after all.
The two countries have not been named after each other since 1962.
Former Bolivian President and country's representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodriguez Field, declined the notion that court proceedings were unusually fast.
Bolivia has announced on Monday that it will "open new opportunities for new relations with Chile" and will give it a chance to "to settle a disagreement of 139 years with satisfaction from both sides," he said.
Calzadi also denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used this conflict as a political handshake.
"Bolivia will never give up the opportunity to have a passage to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"It's an opportunity to prove that we've come from the past."
North Korea has said it will not start a nuclear armament process until it is believed in the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ryo Yong Hong, said they would never re-arm U.S. nuclear weapons until they trusted Washington.
He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the U.S. to follow the promises made at the summit between the two rival countries in Singapore.
Of course, in the United States, the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of reopening talks in Singapore three months ago with Kim Yong Un.
Ri says the U.S. sanctions and the declaration on the end of the war with Korea are "a false dream" to wipe out North Korea.
Washington plans to agree with the Declaration of Independence rather than Pyongyang to take the first step toward disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
On the other hand, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously considering abandoning the weapon, because that is what it considers the only way to peace.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in order to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show has revealed the latest collection of massive headsets that could wear your streets.
If you want to increase the size of your head, or completely protect your body from the sun, don't go far.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have revealed a set of huge and strange hats for their SS19 collection, which led to the Paris style to surprise the current fashion week.
There were a lot of unforeseen events that took place across the country this summer, and designers from all over the world watched the trend again.
The display version was made by Valentino, and the details included in it were like a massive boom that covered all the models.
The other huge accessory between them was cut watermelon, witch's hat and pineapple - but their main goal is not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also revealed his collection of strange masks - just when Halloween comes to the door.
Most of them cover the Tug Bagu<0xC3><0xB1>a and represent the Kanyebal lecturer rather than the fashionable representative of the Universe.
One of the creatures resembled the glacier Tanzania, with its swimming glasses and lasers, when the other had a melting ice cream form.
And if you continue to follow the trend of huge things - you're lucky.
Experts suggest that large bunnies may even cover the streets that are close to you.
In a huge collection of "La Bomba" high-heeled shoes, these hats have a two-foot upper edge, and they can be seen by people like Rihanna and Emily Ratayakovsky.
The cult-like creature in the form of huge hats that covered social media, laid the foundation for a new creature on the podium - a long coastal bag that is just as big as the model she wears.
The dark orange raffle bag is saturated with raffle headers and has a white leather handle, one of the pieces of the Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection from Paris Fashion Week.
The famous makeup stylist, Locksmith FEMAIL, said: "I expect large hats and coastal bags to cover the streets for the next summer - as the designer has so much influence, ignoring the demand, and ignoring it will be very difficult.
John Edwards: Possibility of foreign languages is an important skill for citizens of the world
The Scottish Independent Schools Association conducts monitoring of the results of academic success, and they continue this process in 2018 by paying attention to the good academic performance, which is further strengthened recently in sports, art, music and other public areas.
30,000 pupils are members of the Consulate of Independent Schools of Scotland (SCIS) and they are always available to students and parents to provide the highest service.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their universal citizenship.
As an educational sector that is capable of compiling the curriculum in schools, we see foreign languages as the most popular and demanded subject in the future, chosen in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to a person in a language that he understands, that person will directly reflect on his mind."
"If you talk in your native language, it goes straight to your heart."
This reminds me once again that we cannot rely solely on English, while we strive to build relationships and trust with the representatives of different countries.
Among the independent schools, from the results of the past years’ exams, it is unequivocal to distinguish foreign languages with the highest scores and ratings.
68% of foreign students received the highest score A.
According to data collected from the SCIS partner from 74 schools, 72 percent of students took the highest score in Chinese when 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French students and 63 percent of Hispanic students received the highest rating.
This once again embodies the fact that independent schools in Scotland support the development of foreign languages as an essential tool for the future of children.
Languages are currently attracting as much attention as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering Mathematics) in independent schools and other places.
In 2014, a survey in the UK revealed that 17% of applicants were against using the language barrier to filing the application.
Thus, more and more foreign languages are being taught in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
The increasing number of job places in different languages, the increasing demand for these skills as well.
Regardless of career choices, if someone learns a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future in order to always have a good grasp of the skills they possess.
Communicating with a person in his native language, the person always advances in the aspect of employment.
According to YouGov, among 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% were unable to communicate in any other language, and only 15 percent could handle simple dialogue in French.
And now that language learning is important to our children, that's why we invest in it.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those with a growing economy, will equip children with the skills that will be important for their employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of foreign language classes.
Part of the school concentrates on popular classical languages when the second part concentrates on languages that will be important to the United Kingdom by 2020, and those languages are Chinese or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a language that interests him and will be able to learn from experienced employees and specialists.
The unification of a Scottish independent school strives for creating the desired learning environment for children and wants to equip them with all the necessary skills they need for the future.
No one can deny that foreign languages play a major role in economic development of the country, and that all should be reduced to education.
In addition, foreign languages should be considered as "the necessary skills for international communication."
Independent schools will continue to offer students choice, diversity and top quality.
This needs to be done.
John Edwards Director of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron's debut in Lakers in San Diego
The fans are waiting for LeBron James to make his first start in the lineup of the Lakers.
Lakers coach Lick Walton said LeBron will play a pre-season game against Denver Nuggets in San Diego this week.
But as to how much time it will take, it's still unknown.
"The total number of players will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau said he is likely to play James for a limited time.
Last week, James was asked about his plans, which he had in mind for the seasonal games.
"At this point in my career, I don't have to make a career out of it," he said.
In Trump's West Virginia speech, Jutube Channel
President Donald Trump starts the series of election campaigns in Wiling, West Virginia today.
This is the first of five meetings scheduled to be scheduled next week, and then it will be on the list of places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
According to a letter requested to fill the Supreme Court, Trump intends to form support for mid-term elections as Republicans face a risk of losing control in Congress in the month of November.
What time is it in the West Virginia Times, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's West Virginia meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can check out the live stream of Trump via the YouTube channel link below.
Trump will present the highest court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been involved in sexual violence in the past few days in a conflict investigated by the Federal Investigative Bureau of Investigation.
But the main goal of this meeting is to gain some confidence in the November elections.
Accordingly, the Trump campaign office said the next five meetings aim to "strengthen the positive case and support, as Republicans are trying to protect majoritarians and strengthen them even further in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters said.
"The establishment of control over Congress is important because President Planned for as many states as possible during his ongoing campaign," a spokesman for the Trump campaign said.
According to West Virginia Metro News, the meeting, which will take place at Wesbanko Stadium in Willing, may appeal to supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and all of this will be reflected by the Pittsburgh media."
Last month, another Saturday, Trump visited West Virginia for a second time, in which he won more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Party Senate candidate for Patrice Morise, who is in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Memorials when a candidate goes in search of supporters," said Simon Heder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018: The U.S. is preparing to launch an international tournament on Sunday
After three single-sided seasons on Saturday night, a four-way competition might be exactly what Raider's Tai has been going on for so long.
The variability of push and twist is a completely fictional model in sports, but the athletes still hope it, especially in a race like Raider's Cup.
Now that you've said that, where's the momentum?
"We had six-point advantage and now we have four, which is why we also consider it a little push," said Jordan Spitt, who is today going to his destination.
Of course, Europe has four additional points and one more chance to win twelve points.
Americans feel that they have a very small sense of fear, because they have a very strong motivation ahead of the game, suggesting the level of gameplay between the Spit and Justin Thomas, who have won three points together.
The entire process was designed as an example, and for this example, it's a perfect example.
In the end, it was even more difficult to find the right balance between the two, because the skeleton and the squirrel had a double.
The 15-year-old's goal was to win this match by showing that Americans did not want to leave their country.
"The only thing that matters is to concentrate and be nervous about your game," he said.
That's what every player is up to at this point.
It's available for 18 stitches.
The only players who have scores more than on the spine and tomatoes are Francesco Molinar and Tommy Flittwood, the rival story from the Raider Cup.
Europe is not a great advantage, but it is a great combination of four and it is impossible to get rid of it.
"Molywood" is the only place they didn't shoot bogey either on Saturday night, they left Bogey's Saturday mornings, on Fridays, and on Fridays at nine in the morning.
Based on the meeting and the energy that both players have, it is obvious that the viewer does not have to be funny because none of the players will be able to cover the European victory and the sun will definitely be on Le Golf National or on Molinari.
They may be both, but there are different sizes.
However, there is still a lot of talk about the European Grand Prix.
Buba Watson and Web Wimpsson performed a small piece of work from Sergio Garcia, a four-pointer character from Alex Noren.
Bogey and two double points were scored by the Spanish and won by Sweden and never was so close to gaining that advantage.
But on Sunday, no one will be able to help you out.
The walkthroughs and couples' games are very interesting because they keep an eye on couples' relationships, the advice they give to each other and the strategy that could suddenly change.
Europe played really better as a team and gained a noticeable advantage over the last day, but the U.S. team also showed that they have a perspective to fight and are not going to stand on the side, so everything is still questionable.
For the European Championships, the winner of the race will be 10-6.
Europe will have a huge advantage on the final day after defeating the United States over the weekend and winning 10-6.
Tommy Flintwood and Francesco Molinar duett have won the title of Tiger Woods, who was struggling with hard times to make a pair, on Le Golf National.
Thomas Bourne, from Europe, is confident he will be able to win the Cup he won two years ago, as Europe dominated by a match of the morning pair and won a 3-1 victory.
The U.S. needs more endurance, even though two victories are not enough to achieve the end goal.
Jim Fry's team needs 8 points from 12 weeks to win the cup.
Flintwood was the first European to win four-pointers, after he and Molinar won a sensational victory at Mooliwood and approached the sensational victory of Raider Cup.
After the defeat of Woods and Patrick Reed, their main goal is to beat the American freshman, Brian DeChemau with a 5<0x26>4-point advantage.
While Woody showed an unusual game on Saturday, he lost 19 of 29 games, seven of which were lost.
Justin Rose is on vacation for the four-pointer, he is a partner of Henrik Stanson, with whom he lost the 2<0x26>1 in connection with Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coeppack - the number one and third players in the world.
In the south of Paris, Europe has not had simple games.
Winners of the three-way, Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, made a two-pointer margin after playing with the Americans on Saturday night.
Their 2<0x26>1 victories were deserved when they were dealt with Spanish, John Ram and Jan Poulter, and then returned to Poulter and Rory Maxwell's 4<0x26>3 scores, where the pair lost two of the first two openers.
In the entire history of the team, only four points have been scored twice, and it's worth noting that the team of Fiorentina only needs a score to win.
After two days of being best in a row, more than one week is expected to coincide with a counter attack.
North Korea says "in no way" it is going to unilaterally disarm without gaining confidence.
Speaking to the United Nations, North Korea's foreign minister said the sanctions lead to even more distrust of the United States and are not going to disarm nuclear weapons in a similar situation.
Ryong Ho told the General Assembly of the world that China has taken "no noble steps" over the past few years and stopped the test of nuclear and military weapons, and made it clear that it would not spread further nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we do not see the proper response and action from the U.S. side," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our state's security and we will not be relinquished our country due to such conditions."
When Ri was making a statement about what resistance they would have to do to the US in the current "Phase", in his statement it said that it had not completely rejected unilateral disarmament, the action that Pyongyang carried out two years ago.
Rie also noted that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's June 12 summit treaties and disadvantages, where he promised Kim Trump "to work on disarmament of the Korean peninsula when Trump promised North Korea's security."
North Korea at the end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said Pyongyang must put an atomic weapon first.
The Washington Post also discussed the sanctions imposed on North Korea.
"The U.S. requires "primary disarmament" from Korea and increase pressure on the Korean side to meet this goal, and also rely on the "declaration of the war to end the war," Rie said.
"I think that sanctions can make our squabbles, it's just a dream for those who have no idea about us."
The problem, however, is that our efforts to strengthen our credibility.
There was no mention of the planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader stressed at the United Nations meeting this week.
Instead, the Minister stressed the three meetings with South Korea's leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "The arms problem if it were to go to South Korea instead of America, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so difficult."
Nevertheless, what the tone of the speech was much different than what it was during the U.N. meeting last year, the General Assembly, which aimed at the talks of the United States and North Korea, became irreplaceable after Trump called Kim 'man's man's suicide mission.
Last year, Trump, who had promised to completely destroy Kim and North Korea last year, praised North Korea's leader, but said there was still more work to do and sanctions would be put into place than Korea did.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for "if it takes two years, three or five months - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia have agreed to reward the United Nations Security Council for the plenary step.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Secretary of State told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Safety consuls must continue the implementation of the orders in a unified manner without any failures in order to finally prove re-armament."
The Security Consortium unanimously sanctioned North Korea's sanctions in 2006 to restrict and reduce funding for firearms.
Pompeo met with Reuters at a UN meeting and told him that he would arrive in Pyongyang to plan a second summit next month.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last meeting did not go well.
He left the Pyongyang in July saying that progress has only been made by North Korea with the help of its "aggressive needs."
North Korea has vowed to look into the disarmament process this month and "take the necessary measures."
Kim said she had told Kim that "appropriate measures" to which she was striving were safeguards of security that Trump promised in Singapore and where he promised normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students have been given enough time to rest
Harvard University has delivered a special course that concentrates on teaching students to have enough rest, while the tendency to "night thes" and caffeine tends to grow day by day.
Academicians have found that students who study at number one university don't even know how to get ahead of themselves.
Charles Cezler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigrams and Women's Hospital, created this course that he believes is the first in the United States.
He started this type of exercise when he learned how to fall asleep.
One of the girls came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, during my graduation year?"
He said that he had never told anyone about the need for sleep so far, which surprised me, he told TVgraphs.
The course took place last year, and its main goal is to explain to the students how important it has an impact on academic and sports performance of a good night's sleep, as well as health in general.
Paul Barry, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and chief executive of health services at the University, said the university had decided to present a similar course after seeing how many children had fallen asleep over the course of a week.
The one-week course includes a set of interactive tasks.
The picture of one section shows the different things in the image, such as coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books, and follows the effects of the impact of caffeine and sun rays, and how their effect affects sports performance and what it means to have a sleep routine.
In other section, attendees are asked what level of sleep apnea, chances of ingestion, cancer, and depression may occur.
A map on the campus, with its signs, pushes students to think about their daily routine.
"We know that these things will not change the behavior of all students at once.
But we believe they have the right to know - just like they know the consequences of smoking cigarettes," said Professor Szysler.
The culture of night excavations still exists, he said, and added that modern technologies and increased pressure on students can help increase the problem of sleep disorders.
Good, quality sleep has to be a 'secret weapon' for students to fight stress, fatigue, and irritability - so as to avoid excess weight, because our body's lack of sleep scares the hungry and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sou, a 19-year-old California student who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped shape the course of Professor Sziller after she passed through him as a novice last year as a professor.
He said that the course had opened his eyes to him and he had the motivation to create a wider concept.
The next step in her hope is that all graduates will ask for a similar course before entering the learning environment again.
Professor Suzler advises students to set alarms both before bedtime and before waking up, as well as students should avoid "blue light" that reflect electrical screens and LED light, and can significantly change the rhythm of the heart, which leads to further sleep disturbances.
The Lion King 0:0 Reinvented the game against the Giants
Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga Gould defeated Steven Gerd with a score 1-0.
Ibrox's side was expected to record their first victory in February after St. Johnston's 4-1 victory, but Gary Holt's team overcame the yard and gave him a second defeat in 18 games as manager position and left his team with eight points behind Ledbrook compared to the Premiership leaders' heart.
Mmenga shot seven minutes before the end of the first half and broke the Rangers line, which had never before been at the height of calls.
When Reingers fell to sixth place, Livingston took third place and only one goal left behind by Heberian.
And in addition to the Rangers, there may be additional problems after the player of their core composition Calum Spencer was injured outside the square with an outside jet item.
During the game, eight changes were made to the part of the team that defeated Irene in the quarter-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, passed the same 11th one that managed to score him last week, and he's grateful for how the form of players reacts during each of the meetings.
The Red Sox may have had more balls, but the Redskins did more than that.
It should have been two minutes before the first match could be played, but the Rangers' attack was broken by the opponent's midfielder.
The penalty kick from Kigan Jacobs reached the skiper Creig, but the defense player, Alan Litgou, was able to send the ball back.
Rangers was able to win the ball again, but in the end they didn't have faith.
Alfredo Morello believed that he was given a chance to hit the penitentiary after he was hit by Stephen Lloyds, but the referee demanded that he lift the flag.
Rangers barely managed to carry out two shots in the first half of the game, but for the goalkeeper of the opposing team Liam Kelly did not find it difficult to repel the balls shot by Lasana and Ovie Ejaria.
At the time, the Solvent of Lewinsky could have been a turning point in the 34th minute, and no one could deny that.
The Red Devils were unable to keep up with the heavy lifting of the coronavirus.
Scott Arfield didn't have anything to do with the fact that Dekan Gallagher handed the ball to Robinson, who won the ball and handed the Menga to finish the attack.
As a result, the changes were made to the rays and the change had an effect on the flank, but the block that was made out of the protection player did not break everything.
But Livinigston was still able to maintain the desired pace and thus destroy the opponent, using the long pass between Lithuania and Haklete.
The Holt team could have taken advantage of the last time, but McGregor stood firmly on the square, and he didn't let each maneuver run away until Litgoum called an angle from afar.
At the end of the game, Glen Middleton also called for a penalty at the end of the game, but the referee refused to accept it.
Pros: The view from the viewfinder
And now the page from our Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the counting process...the day when future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hen" was born in Germany.
It was the first time that Audacity discovered and discovered the truth that led to the discovery of the Earth's atmosphere.
Since then, in science, the reader's goal has become part of the pop culture, as well as in the 1950 film "Colorado call," which is given by the dialogue between scientist Rogers and Dale Evans:
Me: "What is this world?"
RB: It's important to note that these types of fusions are used in conjunction with the use of metrics.
"When you do these headphones, you can understand the impact of atoms of minerals, which is caused by radioactivity."
Ian: "Well, he's really going to get this!"
He died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But it's an invention that bears its name that is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to detect lost cells.
A new cancer vaccine is teaching the immune system to discover and kill cells.
The discovery of cells transmitted through a vaccine is part of the treatment.
The method involves the release of immune cells from the patient's body and their laboratory changes.
After a change, you can "find" the proteins that are characteristic of many types of cancer and then re-inject them.
The drug has been shown to provide satisfactory results among cancer patients.
Its use resulted in the loss of ovarian cancer of one of the women for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells, changing them under laboratory conditions to "find" the protein HER2, which is characteristic of many kinds of cancers.
Professor of the U.S. National Institute for Cancer in Maryland, Jay Berzofsky, said: "The results show that the vaccine is promising."
"HER2 causes increased tumors, such as breast, ovarian, lung and bowel," it says.
This type of cell is used to treat leukemia.
Ken West began his pro-trump calls. On the program "Saturday Night Live" covered the cap with the caption: "Let's make America great again."
All of this didn't go very well.
In his performances, he was approached by U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president again in 2020.
During the performance of the third song, "The City of the Ghosts," he closes a hat with the inscription: "Let America Again Be Great". His emotional speech was directed against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"As many times I'm talking with a white man, they're like, 'How do you like Trump when you're a racist?'
He said this: "If I'm worried about racism, I'd go to America a long time ago."
The program "Saturday Night Live" began with a sketch in which the Hollywood star Matt Damon charged Bradt Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Although the show was not broadcast on television, it was broadcast on social media by Chris Rock.
It's unknown if he was trying to make a ruckus out of it.
He also expressed concern about the fact that the team is in a position to address the problems of the team.
"I've got my stage set up.
They said, "Don't go on the stage."
They've been squirming!
"And then they said I'm sinking," the Washington Examiner told The Washington Examiner.
Vest continues: "I wear a superman's helmet because it means you can't tell me what I'm going to do.
Try to love."
At least two times in a row, one of the people spoke to Variety: "There was a razor silence in the entire studio."
The singer was invited to the show, instead of her ex-girlfriend, Rapper McMillan died a few days ago.
There are a lot of people in the world who love "I Love You" music video for their new album.
Wess was supported by the head of the conservative NGO TPUSA, Kenneth Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the most courageous people on the planet: thank you for standing against the mob."
Karen Hunter, lead singer of talk show, said on Twitter: "The vest was just 'the one who was and that's great'."
"But I will not be able to award anyone (by selling his music or with the support of his "creation") who spreads an ideology that harms my society.
He is FREE.
"We are free," he said.
Before starting the show, the rapper wrote on Twitter that he changed his formal name and from now on it will be YE.
He's not the first artist to change his name in a similar fashion to Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and P. Diddy.
It's worth noting the legend of music - the prince who changed his name to "artist who was known as prince."

The public prosecutor's office is reviewing the allegations.
'Game of Thrones' star Kit Harington talks about "toxic masculinity"
Kit Harrington is known for his role in the HBO fantasy series "Game of Thrones."
The 31-year-old actor talks about the stereotype of the character Ma<0xC5><0x8D>, who says that guys watching similar roles on screens of similar roles believe that if there are black people, they will receive respect from others.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitty notes that "something is wrong" and wants to know how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in <0x23>MeToo era.
Kit, who just got married at the age of 31 on Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie admits she feels strongly in the face of this problem.
"Now I'm confused - what do we do with masculinity?" he said.
"What did we teach our kids when they were growing up, and that's why we're seeing these problems right now."
Kathleen believes that this problem has increased the number of suicide bombers on television.
He asks, "What is nature and what is it?"
What are you teaching in the street and on the TV that forces boys to stand on the side of a man being a man?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is: How can we change it?
"That's why it's not appropriate for young men."
In an interview, he admitted that he would not have access to the "Game of Thrones" previolent and sequels when the final series comes out next summer.
From November, Kit will take part in the remake film "The Real West" about the producer and his brother of the film.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing about playing "Game of Thrones" was having a meeting with his wife Rose.
"I met with my wife in this show, that is, in fact, this show broke my family, and this is where my life begins," she said.
Rose plays the role of Igret, a character from Kitty, John Snow falls in love with Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married Leslie's family land in Scotland in June 2018.
China: 14% of new cases
China has said that the number of HIV infections has increased by 14%.
More than 82,000 people have been infected in the country, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of them have passed through sex, which is different from past experiences.
Traditionally, HIV has rapidly spread through blood transfusions in different parts of China.
But the number of people infected in this way is almost zero, officials from China's Ministry of Health said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of HIV-AIDS infected people in China is increasing by 100,000 every year.
Transfusion of HIV through sex is a major problem in the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination still persists there.
Studies show that 70-90% of men who have sex with men are eventually married to a woman.
The transmission of the disease occurs during sex due to the incorrect use of its methods of protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has made a pledge to access AIDS treatment globally to overcome this problem.
Maxine Voters denies the leakage of data from the Republican party senators, calling him "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories of conspiracies."
A member of the American House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, denies widespread allegations over the weekend that his staff has released personal information from three Republican senators and posted it on Wikipedia pages.
He argued that the allegations were ruled by far-right experts and sites.
"The lies, the lies, and even more disgusted lies," Walters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Personal information covered the addresses and telephone numbers of the South Carolina senator, Lindsay Graham and Utah Senators, Mike Lee and Orin Haws House.
The information appeared on Thursday by an unknown person in the online space. During this time a panel hearing was held in the Senate on charges related to sexual harassment of the justice candidate Brett Kavano.
The information was leaked after three Senators asked Kavanaugh's questions.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, say uploading of the post took place from an IP address linked to the Walter's office.
"It's an unfounded claim, it's a false and absolutely travesty," Walters continued.
"My staff member is in no way responsible for leaking this information, we have reached a compromise on their identity, personal information and security.
"It's a false statement, and it's completely false."
Wouter's claim quickly followed critical assessments, including from the former White House press secretary Ariel Fluer.
“He’s angry to deny this,” the flash write.
"This is a fact that Vother does not have the temperament required for the membership of the Congress.
When someone accuses you of something that they didn't do, the person gets angry.
People don't make a fuss.
People don't ask questions about their motivations.
It keeps the peace and tranquility."
Fleaser seems to have compared the criticism of the Democrats to Judge Kavanaugh, who was blamed by critics for being too angry when listening to the news on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who votes for a position in the UOTER midterm elections, also voiced his views on Twitter.
"Great, if that's true," he said on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said his cabinet had warned "the relevant services and law enforcement agencies about this scam".
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified,” he continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all actions that are devastating and dangerous to any and every member of my staff.”
Johnny English's new hit review: The weak parody of a spy by Rowan Atkinson
Now it's a tradition to look for meaning in any new film with a British trend, and it seems this applies to this new version of Johnny English action-commercial parody franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English, and resurfaced in 2011, with Johnny English.
Is there a possibility for the Irish self-expression of our nation to become a new opportunity for our export of our nation on the subject of the obvious garbage?
Anyway, the lackluster, rubber-faced Johnny Ingles' license to spoil everything was renewed for a second time - it gives us that name more than anything else to signal that it is a broader comic created not for English-language film-lover territories.
Of course, he is a fool's secret agent, which, despite his strange claims about light glamour, has slightly claustrophobic properties, master's apartment barricades, and grown-up ULF features of the Jeell, who contributes to a single note at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
It was originally based on a traveler and an international secret man played by Atkinson once in a day in forgotten Barclaycard advertising.
One or two good moments is Johnny English in this last part.
I loved it when Johnny Ingli's mid-range helicopter dressed in a armored mercenary approaches the helicopter and the rotor blades are intertwined to the rear of his helmet.
The physical comedy talent of Atkinson is evident, but humor seems slightly weakened and strangely superior, especially when the "serious" movie brands such as 007 and the unfulfilled mission itself offer the comedy as an ingredient.
It's as if humor is intended for children, not for adults, and for me, Johnny Ingleshi's silly misfortunes are not as creative and focussed as the jokes of Atkinson's mute films in Mr Bing.
The real problem today is that the UK is facing a serious problem.
Cyber Hacker entered the UK's super secret web app, revealing the identity of all field agents in the UK before the concerns of spying - a small role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the last drop for a prime minister who is a pompous and fighter figure who is already suffering from a complete failure of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does a maximum of that quasi-Terez-Mei character, but there's not much to do in the script.
His advisors in the intelligence direction of him, according to the fact that every spy is compromised, he has to send someone back to his retirement.
That means Johnny Ingliss himself is an idiot, currently working as a teacher at a very good institution, but unofficially teaches you how to become a secret spy: here are some good jokes when an English school offers a role-playing academy in espionage.
Inglis returned to the Whitehall emergency briefing and reunited with his former multi-tasking co-mate, Ben Miller, who plays again.
Baffy is now married to the Head of the underwater boat, a groove role of fun hockey where Vick Pepperd is a bit lost.
So the Batman and Robin, who are in the secret service of his majesty, are reunited with the terriblely wrong performance of his greatness, suddenly meet Olga Kurileenko, a beautiful, handsome woman named Olivia Buletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the magic of a charismatic technological billionaire, which claims to be capable of resolving the UK's computer challenge: the villain Jason Volta, who plays Jake Lee.
Ingli and Baffy begin their odyssey with a curtain high ouija: disguised as waitresses, they fire into a very expensive French restaurant; they form chaos and steal a Volta on an expensive yacht; and in England, St. Anarchy leads to the use of a virtual reality device to learn about the interior of a Volta house.
All stops are certainly pulled in this last sequence, but as benevolent and energetic as it is, quite a bit of a child's television is for it.
It's quite an average thing.
And just as Johnny English couldn't care less about other movies, I was like, "Can't the British cinema industry give Rowen Atkinson the role that's really fair for his talent?"
The Labour Party rejects plans to launch a plan for the UK to work four days a week and pay five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that the British will work four days a week - but will receive five pays.
The party's leadership wants to give company leaders the savings they have earned through the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to give them an extra day of rest.
In this way, employees will be able to wait for three days, but they will be able to return to the same house.
Sources report that the idea was "moderate" of the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country happy for the benefit of employees.
The transition to four-day week has already been approved by trade unions as a way for employees to benefit from a changing economy.
A high-ranking Labour party source told Sandy Thays: “It is expected to announce policy review until the end of this year.
"It's not going to happen immediately, but a four-day work week is an aspiration in line with party approach to balance the economy in favor of employees, as well as party's general industrial strategy."
The Labour Party is not the first to adopt this idea, the Greens Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 General Election campaign.
At the moment, the lyrical nature of the game is not entirely clear.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not discussed by the party."
Northern Chancellor John MacDonald used the Labour Party's last week conference to make clear his vision of the socialist economy in the economy.
Mr. Macdonald said he was ready to defuse power for "uncutive directors" and "speculative" companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also suggest that the current shareholders of water supply companies may not fully regain their interests, as the Labour government may have to "exceed" on the grounds of perceived crime.
He also confirmed the plan to insert employees into the board of the company and create inclusive proprietary funds to transfer 10 percent of the capital of private sector companies to employees, which is equivalent to the annual dividend of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Linds Graham, John F. Kennedy, said that "60 minutes" would change the FBI's investigation into Cavan.
Investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation over allegations against Bret Kavanaugh has been delayed by at least a week and final voting process on his appointment to the Supreme Court and asks whether the statements made by the bureau force Republican senators to push them to support.
This week's interview of "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators, John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, whether they could tell the Federal Bureau of Investigation something that could change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing, I said I was going to talk to the court of Kawaii.
I called him after it happened, when the charges were announced, and I asked, "Are you that Kate?"
He was strong, he was strong, he was weak."
But the sound of the tingling sounds strange.
"My mind is full of Brett Kavanaugh, and it will be a similar accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Doctor Ford, I know what happened, but I know the following: Brexit has strongly rejected it," added Graham, referring to what Christine Blaise Ford said.
"Anyone who does this will not be able to prove it.
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the festival of people around the world and has it done to reduce poverty?
This weekend New York will host the World Citizen's Festival, an annual music event that has an extremely impressive composition and an equally impressive mission of artists stars; who must end world poverty.
Now, in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people heading to the big field of Central Park who will not only enjoy the fame of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes but will also raise awareness about the true goal of the event, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an international project of poverty, an international propaganda group hoping to end poverty, increase the number of people fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (except in case you would like to purchase a VIP ticket), participants at the concert should perform a number of tasks or "activities" as a volunteer, write to a world leader, make a telephone call, or any other important way to raise awareness about the true purpose of the event, which is to end poverty.
But how much of the world's population has changed over the past 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert of people to convince people to ask for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" when people think they make a real difference by signing an online petition or by posting a tweet?
Since 2011, the World Citizen has reported that he has registered more than 19 million "activities" from his supporters, pushing them to host different goals.
He said the activities helped to encourage world leaders to declare commitments and policies that equal to more than $ 37 billion, which could affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and statements pertaining to its activities, of which at least $10 billion was already distributed or collected.
Until now, the funds have had a direct impact on more than 649 million people around the world.
Some of these commitments include food power, partnerships with UK-based investors and performers to "help children grow their full potential," granting Rwanda $35 million to help end food shortages in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you are, we can hand over the social injustices of food inconvenience to the story," said Tracy Ulman, a food power ambassador gathered at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities were delivered to the UK, calling on them to improve food for mothers and orphans, the government announced it would fund the project, the food force that would reach 5 million women and children with food supplies.
In response to a frequently asked question on its website, which is, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
He said: "This will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and be defeated.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jean Monnet are among some acts that will be led by Deborah Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Jackman at this year's event in New York.
U.S. may use naval forces to "block" Russia's energy exports - Interior Minister
The U.S. may appeal to its maritime forces to disrupt Russian energy, the drum market, including the Middle East, to Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Interior Minister, as quoted by Washington.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - in particular, by inviting a legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to trade with energy, the same as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And, according to official data, there are ways and means to cope with it.
"The United States has the ability and the ability to make sure our Navy is open by sea and, if necessary, blockades to ensure that their energy does not flow into the market," he said.
Zinke appealed to participants of the event, hosted by the Consumer Energy Union, a not-for-profit group that present itself as the "energy consumer voice" in the U.S.
He went to compare Washington's approach to approach with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"Economic options are more or less leveraging and modifying fuel than Russia and Russia," he said, referring to Russia as "one specialty," whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The Trump administration's goal is to increase exports of its liquid gas to Europe and replace Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to abandon the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said has made Moscow a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the current pipeline's capacity, is a clean economic project of 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin claims that the corrupt opposition to the project in Washington is simply caused by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has caused dissatisfaction with Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading organization in the industry, the German Industry Federation (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with the third state meditating on our energy supply," said Dr. Kempf, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin after the last meeting between Germany and Germany.
"Elizabeth Warren is seriously considering the 2020 presidential election," says Massachusetts senator.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously take a serious look" in the run-up to the presidential election after the midterm elections.
At the Holoki City Hall, in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he is considering the participation.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and rebuild our broken government, and this includes the woman's presence," Hill said.
"After November 6, I take a serious look at the presidential struggle."
Warren led President Donald Trump during his visit to the City Hall, saying that he "was heading this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," he said.
Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Bret Kavanaugh, were sincere.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, before voting, we need to investigate the federal bureau."
But a survey on Thursday showed that most Warren voters don't think he should run for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Political Research at the University of Sapphire/Boston Glouby, "probably" fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said Senators should not run the vote.
Sixty-three percent support this claim.
The poll showed more support for former governor Daval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against it.
Other well-known names in democracies will be discussed in 2020 by Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said in January that he will officially make a decision, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Peylin cited the post-traditional stress disorder of Trek Peyllen during Donald Trump's rally
The 26-year-old has spent a year in Iraq since the occupation.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through, when he comes back, I'm connecting it to other families who are experiencing some of the post-traditional stress disorder, and the wounds our soldiers have brought back," Trump said in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Peyllen called his arrest "a blind eye to the problem" and said to his son and other war veterans, "They're going back a little bit, they're back, they're coming back and they're wondering why their friend and pilots and other military members are paying attention to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Alaska, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence against women, the words of Den Bennett, a spokesman for the police department, and the wearing of weapons during a stay-at-home order.
18 states, Colombia's District supports new law on asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges against a new U.S. policy that does not grant asylum to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 U.S. states and Colombian districts filed a jury summary on Friday in Washington to support asylum-seekers, inviting what policies, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case is not revealed by Grace Sessen, who filed an appeal against the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August.
He said his partner "and his violent children" had been abused by his violent gang members, but U.S. officials declined to apply for asylum on July 20.
He was trapped in a prison.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala who produce a large number of applicants for the U.S. asylum as these nations stand facing acute gangs and domestic violence.
A new US asylum policy lifted a 2014 decision that allowed immigrant expatriates to escape domestic violence and receive asylum.
In a statement issued on Friday, Colombia's Attorney General Carl Raszene said the new policy "resolutely violates state, federal and international law for decades."
"The federal law requires that all asylum seekers be based on specific facts and circumstances of demand, and this restriction violates the principle," the court said.
Convinced them that the policy that prohibits immigrants from entering is tarnished by U.S. policy, saying that they are becoming more entrepreneurs and "supply to supply the necessary work force."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions, in June, has been ordered by immigration judges to stop seeking asylum in the home of victims of domestic and gang violence.
"The security is available for those who leave their country for fear of persecution or political views, or for fear of persecution or for political reasons, or for any particular social group," she said in a statement on June 11.
The shelter has never been a solution to all problems -- even if there are serious problems -- which people face every day around the world.
The number of survivors in Palau, where the number of victims in the search for survivors' races has doubled
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"There's a lot of tension," said the 35-year-old mother, who was suffering from a fever in her evacuation center in Palu.
"Every minute of every day, the machines are in front of the camera."
There is no clean water."
People are returning to their houses in their ruined houses, bringing their bodies into the water, trying to save everything that they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were injured by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, have been evacuated.
Some of the injured, including Dwight Harris, who has fractured his waist and shoulder, are rested outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to prolonged strong attestos.
The tears were filled with tears when he re-entered the narrative about sensations when an angry earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where his wife and daughter lived with him.
"It wasn't the time to get away.
"I went to the ruins of the wall, I think," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had been in the city at the wedding.
"I was trying to figure out how to get my husband to talk to me, and then I was silent.
I don't know what happened to him and his daughter.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. Ambassador to China accuses China of "propaganda advertising" on "violence"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement, where the U.S. is demanding common benefits of U.S.-China trade every day, the U.S. ambassador in China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda using the American press.
US President Donald Trump addressed Des Moines Register last Wednesday in Des Moines Register, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after China's accusations of trying to intervene in the November 6 US Congress.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, which made it clear what U.S. officials told Reuters, have become a new phase of the campaign escalating Washington in an attempt to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to promote advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in the escalation of the trade war, where they raise tariffs on each other's imported goods.
China's retaliatory tariffs were designed to hit exporters in the United States, such as Iowa, backed by the Trump Republican Party, say Chinese and American experts.
Terry Brunsted, an ambassador to China and a former long-time governor of Iowa, is the main exporter of agricultural goods in China, according to Beijing, affected American employees, farmers and businessmen.
Bransted wrote in a Monday's Des Moines Register that China "has now doubled this violence by spreading propaganda in our free press."
"In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government enjoys the U.S. free speech and free press by placing ad at Des Moines Register for a paid advertising," Branstad said.
"In contrast to this, here in Beijing along the street in the newspaper Jikhuri, you'll find limited different opinions and you won't find any real difference to reflect on the trajectory of China's problematic economy, which shows that the media is under heavy thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most famous newspapers refused to publish" his article, but he did not say which newspaper.
With the loss of Kavanagh, the republican foreign women before the midterm elections, warn analysts
As long as high-ranking Republicans are waiting in line with expectations and defend the candidate of the highest court, Bret Kavano, facing several allegations of sexual assault, warned analysts that they will receive a negative result, especially from women during the interim elections.
The emotions surrounding it were extremely high, and most Republicans are already registered with Yo and feel that they want to move forward to vote.
"It is impossible to take a backseat to this," Grant Ryeer, a professor of political science at Maxwell School of Siracusa, said in a statement published on Saturday.
Rhymer said he suspects that Senator Jeff Flayke (Arizona)'s last push to investigate the federal bureau would be enough to convince voters to calm down.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, chief adviser to the progressive group MoveOn, and a national spokesperson for the Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration at the Senate Hall, protesters sang "November comes!" when Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to move ahead with the appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blaise Ford's testimony, reported Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of democracies will be at a very high level," St. Stephen Rosenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high; it's true."
But it can be higher, especially among voters in suburban and young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29 who do not like the president, often do not participate in the elections."
Even before the public displays of Ford's allegations of sexual assault against a high court candidate, analysts predict this would result in a negative result, or Republicans are pushing forward with evidence.
"This has become a silly mess for Republicans," Michael Style, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about voting for a committee, or voting for a final vote, it's also about how Republicans got into that and how they treated it," said Guy Sesley, U.S. priorities director of the group, which promotes the election of Democrats, according to the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat apprehensive about who should believe in the Ford and Cavano shows, and a little bit more supports the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows 41 percent of respondents necessarily or probably believe in the Ford Displays when 35 say they will necessarily or probably believe in Kavanos.
Additionally, 38% of respondents say that they are likely or unequivocally wrong in giving evidence when only 30 percent say the same to Ford.
After pressure from flutes, the federal bureau is currently investigating by Ford, as well as the accusations of at least one complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported.
Ford gave his oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavano Nasva was in a position of power when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez said the Supreme Court had shown him the genitals when they were at a party, during the period of teaching at Yale University in the 1980s.
Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet in order to capture Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new project to oppose Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company that builds Berners-Lee's open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is saved and what people have the right to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that his intention to Inrupt is "world domination."
"Now we have to do this," he said.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to access their own "Personal Online Data Storage", or POD.
This may include contact lists, case list, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s just like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are available in one browser and at the same time.
What makes a unique personal data repository online is that it entirely depends on the user with whom the information will be accessed.
The company calls it "administration of authority through data."
According to the CEO of the company, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring together resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Liss, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, with several employees from developers with whom the contract was signed to work on the project, and unify the volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized applications via tools that are available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team didn't talk to Facebook or Google about whether they could submit a full change, where all their business models would be fully restored in one day.
"We're not asking them to give up on us."
In an article published on Sunday, Berners-Lee said that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the Solid network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the Consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, the brand has been on the brink of extinction.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the future of this industry," said Berner-Lee.
George Bernard Shaw quote: World War One is a war criminal
As the only cleric in the Church of England in the First World War, the Cross of Victoria was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Priest Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Blingliss and Leicester.
However, he killed sniper four days later, never knowing that he received the UK's highest military honor.
On Saturday, at Paris, two of his children erected a memorial stone in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his children, Michael Van, said it was a "wonderful symbolic" that the stone was lifted from his grandfather's award exactly 100 years ago.
According to the London newspaper, on September 29, 1918, Colonel-Leitant Van led his battalion along the San-Kentin Canal "Despite a very thick fog and artillery fire."
And then he pulled out the fireworks and "manly manly" led the line towards Artillery in front of him and fired three of them.
Vladimir Putin was assassinated by German sniper on October 4, 1918, exactly one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could't have done, but that's humility."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also wore a crown after parading, led by the former Brentwood youth band.
Michael Van said he " feels very appreciated because he participates in Paris," adding "the courage of the true hero is shown with the support that will be given to many people."
The Martial Arts Fans have spent the night to watch Bellator 206 to keep their Goch Peppa instead.
Imagine you could spend an entire day renting a bellator for 206, and you couldn't see the main event.
The San Jose report included 13 battles, including six major cards, and was shown live on five channels in the United Kingdom.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, after Gerard Mussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet with each other, UK audiences were left stunned when broadcasting over the Gobble pepper.
There are some who have been waiting for them all night to get their hands on.
One of the nurses described it as "something that is sick joke."
"It's a state regulation that this transfer was inappropriate at 6am, so they had to switch to a children's program," said David Schwartz, the senior vice president of Bellator marketing and communications when asked for a transfer.
"Puppy, yes."
The bellator, CEO Scott Cocker, said they were working on their graphics to take into account the future of UK viewers.
"I think when I think about the repetition, I think we might have something to think about," Kocker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning, it's Sunday, and we can't work on it until our time is Sunday, and there's no Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when you changed, there were a lot of texts going forward and back and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical bug.
But that wasn't the case, it was the government.
I'll give you a hint, then this won't happen.
We will have five battles instead of six - as we normally do - and we've tried to show more for fans, and we just got too much.
That's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'cause he was sexually abused'
Tom Daley says he grew up feeling depressed over others because of his sexual orientation - but that motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old said she couldn't understand until she went to high school, where "not everyone is like me."
For the first time, while speaking on 4 radio about Desert Island Discs, leading by Lauren Lavern, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that when he became a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-awaited Yang Jiang, who had been suffering from illness for several months.
Daley explained that when he grew up, he felt "lesser" because he was "not socially accepted when boys and girls liked him."
He said: "Today, I realized that I felt less and differently than others, was a real feeling that gave me the strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone, when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
The bronze medalist from the two-time Olympic Games became a participant of the LGBT campaign and used his appearance at the Games of the Commonwealth of Nations this year to protest homosexuality in Australia in the presence of more countries.
He said he took out his vote because he was lucky to have lived openly without identifying others, and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time champion of the world said he fell in love with the man - the filmmaker Dustin Lens Blake, who he met in 2013, "inextricably took me."
Daley married Oscar, who is 20 years older than her last year, but she said age difference was never a problem.
"When you've been through so much at your age," he said at his first Olympics, "and his father died of cancer three years later," he said, "it's hard to find someone at the same age as him who has experienced such an uplifting and unlucky experience."
The couple became parents to their son in June, renamed Robert Rey Blake-Deilee, and Daley says his "total values" have been changed.
"If you asked me last year, the only thing I wanted was to win the Gold Medal," he said.
"You know there are more important things in life than gold.
It's my gold medal."
Robert's son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't get the fact he had to die and one of the last thing he asked was whether he had tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to stay in the front row.
"I can't say I didn't want to be your father," he said.
"I was holding her hand when she stopped breathing and it didn't happen until she really stopped breathing and didn't die, I finally didn't realize she was immortal," he said.
The following year, Daisy won a bronze at the 2012 Olympics and a bronze.
"I knew it was something I've been dreaming about all my life - to dive in front of my fans at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that," he said.
This has also inspired me to choose my first song - Proud by Heather Small - which with him led to a resonance with him at the Olympics, and still throws the Grummantel Griffantt.
Desert Island Discs will be on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15.
Michaelsson's ribbed body was found on Saturday
U.S. Phil Michelsson sets a record on Sunday when he will play 47 matches on the Rieder Cup, but he will have to retake the form as a stage of his misfortune.
Michelangelo, who will take part in a two-year series of events, was introduced by Captain Jim Fury on Saturday in Forball and Forsyth.
Rather than being in the center of the action, as often as in the United States, five-times-leader won a day between being a dirge and working on it in the hope of rectifying what he is suffering for.
Never the straightest driver, even in the peak of his career, will fit perfectly in a 48-year-old Le Golf Nassional course, for a long and rough routine kick.
And if the course itself is not complicated enough, Michaelsson, at the ninth match on Sunday, confronts the exact British Open Champion Francesco Molinar, who competes with novice Tommy Flintwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans start with four points below the 12-singles match, at the hot start, the Michelson match will be absolutely important.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much more.
"Man understood the role he played today, his hand grabbed my shoulder, and he said he was ready to go tomorrow," Fury said.
"He's very confident.
He's been in the hospital for a long time, and he's done a lot of things this week.
I couldn't believe it was a two-piece suit.
I've been meaning to do more, but that's how it works, and that's the way we think we're going to be successful.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
This week, Mikelsson will go ahead with Nick Faldo, the record for the most matches in the Riedder Cup.
This could be the beginning of the end of his career, which never coincided with the heights of his individual record.
Michaelsson has 18 victories, 20 defeats, and seven half, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangible sensations.
"It's funny, it's sarcastic, it's sarcastic, it's a language you like to joke about people, and it's a good type that you should have on your team," he explained.
"I think it's going to be a tough week, but I think it's going to be a good week."
It's much more than just playing."
The European Union's chief of staff, Thomas Bourne, said the big difference could soon disappear.
Thomas Bourne, the European captain, knows with experience that being ahead of the Rieder Cup in recent days can easily become an uncomfortable race.
Danes made her debut in 1997 on Valderam, where the side that Steve Balleros captained, had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but approached the finish line with the smallest difference, winning what was 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big difference in Valdera; we had a big difference in Brooklyn where we were defeated, and the Waldera where we won, but only," Bourne said after watching 5-3 victories on Fridays, as well as yesterday when he had the advantage of 10-6 Le Golf Nassion.
And so the story goes on and on to everyone's story that it's not over.
It takes full time to complete.
You go out and do everything you need to.
It doesn't work until the squirrels are put on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try to win the bowl, and that remains our focus.
"All this time, I've said, I've been focusing on 12 players that are on our side, but we know very well what lies on the other side - the greatest players in the world."
He was so happy to see his team play with a broken golf game, Bourne added: "I couldn't imagine that.
There's going to be another beast.
We're going to have a different experience, and that's a different thing.
It's a great feeling when you stand there with your partner, when everything goes well, but when you go out alone, then you check out to go full as a golf player.
This is the message that needs to be sent to a player, highlight your maximum tomorrow.
"Now you have your partner on the back, and he has to come out and show his maximum."
In contrast to the Bournemouth, Jim Fury expects his players to play more individually than in pairs, the exception is Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Fury himself was at the bottom of both major coups of the previous day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, before he became a loser when Europe gave birth to "the wonders of the media."
"I remember every word that came out of it," he said when asked how the captain had addressed his players in 1999 when he was led by his players on the last day.
"We have 12 matches tomorrow, but you want to get a quick start like you see in Brooklyn.
When this impulse takes one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the matches.
We've had a lot of people come up to us and say, 'You know, we're trying to make a difference, you know, we're trying to make a difference.'
Thomas tasked with resisting and met in the main match between Rory McElroy, Paul Cassi, Justin Rose, John Rem, Tom Fitzwood, and Ian Pulter in the upper half of the Europeans.
"I've gone through this series with this group of guys because I think it includes all the pathways that way," he said when selecting his single.
The German invasion of Germany was once again under way.
The German fleet's new frigate was due to be adopted in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warships, but could not be adopted until at least next year due to defective systems and increasing costs, local media reported.
The adoption of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates will be postponed until the first half of 2019 as the newspaper Die Zeit cited by the military representative.
The warship was supposed to be included in 2014, but the issue of supplying was complicated by the completion of this ambitious project.
The four-piece Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship, ordered by the fleet in 2007, must be substituted as a replacement for the Bremen class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a strong pitcher, a range of rockets against the zenith and rockets, as well as some stealth technologies such as radar reduction, infrared and acoustic technologies.
Other important features include long storage periods - it should be possible to place new frigates away from the domestic port for two years.
However, constant delays mean that the latest warships designed to strengthen Germany's naval force will be outdated when they get to work, say Die Zeit.
The Avdovite F125 frigate fell into the headlines last year when the German fleet officially denied the reception of the vessel and returned it to the Blohm <0x26> Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet had returned to the ship's builder after its delivery.
The reason for the return is little known, but the German media pointed to a number of important "soft and hardware defects" that would make the warship useless if it was launched into combat missions.
The software defect was particularly important, as Baden-Wuerttemberg's class ship manages a crew of 120 sailors - just half the personal composition of the outdated Bremen class frigate.
It's also found that the ship is dramaticly overweight, which reduces its effectiveness and limits the ability of the fleet to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" will be twice as heavy as the warships Germany used during World War II.
In addition to the problematic equipment, the price makes it difficult to involve the complete project crew training - another issue.
As they say, it has reached an impressive 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - from 2.2 billion euros.
The continued problems of the latest frigates are of particular importance in light of the latest warnings that the strength of the German fleet is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartlett, chairman of the German Parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that the fleet was actually "disabled from deployment ships."
According to the representative, the problem is curtailed over time, because old ships have been removed from use, but replacement ships have not been removed.
He said there was no way he could have been part of the Benedict-Wuerttemberg-class frigate to join the fleet.
National Trust keeps an eye on the secret life of bats
A new study carried out in Scottish mountainous areas aims to find out how bats are using landscape food for hunting purposes.
The findings hope to shed light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help us develop the activities of the conservation of nature.
The survey of Scottish National Trust scientists tracks ordinary and small bats, as well as brown bats and bats, invading gardens in the West Roses.
Special recorders will be set up along the main locations of ownership to control bat activity during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers also conduct motion monitors using hand detectors.
All the experts analyze the sound recordings of the sounds of the sounds will determine the frequency of bats and what type of creature they do.
Then it consists of a habitat map and a report to create a detailed picture of their behaviors across the landscape.
Rob Davar, a national trust advisor for nature conservation in Scotland, hopes to reveal the results, which habitat areas are the most important for bats and how each species will use them.
This information will allow you to identify the benefits of habitat management jobs, such as building meadows on how forested areas can be kept for bats and other types of associated with them.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom declined significantly over the last century.
They threaten the construction and development works, which affect their habitat and destroys the habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning are also at risk, as well as adhesive paper and some chemical facilities of building materials, as well as domestic cats attacks.
Bats aren't really bats.
However, because of their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a victim.
They use sophisticated ecolocation techniques to identify the location of insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The Scottish National Trust, responsible for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious.
They have ten trained experts who regularly carry out research, inspections, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization also organized the protected area for the first and only bats of Scotland, on Triw's land, at the Dumbled-Galwave, representing the eight houses of ten bats of Scotland face-to-face.
According to David Thompson, the land is the ideal area for them.
"We've got a large area in our neighborhood," he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees with a lot of good habitats.
But there are a lot of things we don't yet know about bats, so the jobs that we produce here and other lands can help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
It stresses the importance of bats inspection, over the conditions prior to the protection works, as unintentional destruction of one maternity nest could kill up to 400 female and young people, most likely resulting in the total destruction of the local population.
Bats are protected, and they are killed, burned, or burned, or their destruction is not illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer for the protection of bats, is a guild to the public to help them.
He said: "We have so much more to learn about our bats and our species, we just don't know how they live."
Ronaldo has been freed from charges of rape, and lawyers have complained about the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news," claiming that people should be "declared" by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which was published by the German newspaper Der Spiegel.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman in the Las Vegas Hotel, 2009.
He is also charged with a $375,000 fine to prevent the incident from being heard, the Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video posted to 142 followers of Taw, a few hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, called the allegations "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
"What you said today is false," he said in front of the winner of the Ballon d'Or.
"They want to use my name.
That's normal.
They wanted to be known as my name, but that's part of their job.
"I'm a happy man, and I'm all right," the man smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the sake of a claim, which they have called "an unidentified report on suspicions in the field of private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Shertz says the player is compensated "for moral damages, in accordance with the gravity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of privacy rights in recent years."
The incident occurred in June 2009 in Palms Hotel and Las Vegas Casino.
After the meeting in the night club, based on the information, Ronald and Meiorga returned to the player's number, where he was charged with anally, according to the completed sheets, in the Clark District Court in Nevada.
According to him, after the incident, Ronaldo landed on his knees and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who stole "one percent."
According to reports, the couple had sex with each other, but it was mutual.
Meiorga also states that she came to the police and showed her at the hospital, taking pictures of her injuries, but then agreed to deal with the settlement without a dispute because she felt "a fear of prosecution" and feared that she would become "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says he is now trying to incite a dispute because he is still traumatized by the incident.
Ronaldo was on his way from Manchester United to Madrid, in an attack on the defendant, and was handed over to the Italian giant Yuvei this summer in a 100 million-dollar agreement.
Brexit: the loss of the UK's "inanimate" car manufacturers
Due to the loss of the status of the world leader in automobile manufacturing in the United Kingdom, business secretary Greg Clarke says after Brexit.
He added that the fact that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the European Union without a deal, that would lead to temporary disruption of production at its plant located near Derby in Burnaton.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said that the impact of border delays, if the deal is implemented, would affect Brexit jobs.
Burnaton's factory (which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis) has produced about 150,000 cars in the previous year, and 90% of them have exported to other EU countries.
“I think if the UK leaves the European Union and at the end of March, we will see a stop to production at our factory in Burnatson, Toyota CEO Marvin Kuk, said in a statement.
Other UK automotive manufacturers fear of the UK's departure without agreements on the sale of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini-quarantine in Oxford after a month of Brexit.
The main issue, which concerns the opinion of car manufacturers, envisages the risks of setting up a supply chain in case of carrying out a Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line operates on the basis of a so-called "timed" where spare parts are delivered every 37 minutes for vehicles ordered in the EU as well as UK suppliers.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, it can lead to irregularities on the border that will cause delays and a shortage of parts in the industry.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to stop the inventory for more than one day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, so the production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's check-up plan on future relations with the EU is "exactly designed to avoid such checks on the border."
“We must accept this deal. We want to get the best deal that will allow us, as I have said, to achieve success at this point, and also to take advantage of that opportunity in the future,” he said on BBC Radio 4’s Today Program
Based on the evidence received from other manufacturers besides Toyota, we definitely need the opportunity to continue delivering highly successful delivery networks.
Toyota has not been able to comment on the period of termination of production, but we have warned that if this continues for a long time, this will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately reduce jobs.
Peter Tsuvalari, who has been working at the Burnton facility for 24 years and is the head of a professional union at the factory, says his members are very concerned about this fact.
A spokesman for the government said: "We will deliver a precise and rational plan for our future relations with the European Union."
The White House's announcement of Trump's visit to the White House may be delayed
According to a statement released by the White House on Sunday, high-ranking meetings of Donald Trump with the Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein "may be postponed for the next week" as the fight against the Supreme Court-elected candidate Bret Kavanf continued.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of a special adviser Robert Mueller, who seeks to investigate Russia's interference in the election, ties between Trump's help and Russia, and potential misconduct by the president.
Whether Trump will oppose the Deputy Minister of Justice or whether he will pose a threat to Mueller's independence, this rumor has been on the ground for months.
Earlier this month, during an interview with New York Time, Rosenstein said he was considering using the hearing equipment to talk to Trump, and the possibility of delaying the president based on the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein declined to comment on this report.
On Monday morning, he returned to the White House, and on his return he was scheduled to resign.
Therefore, a meeting with Trump, which he visited United Nations, was held in New York on Wednesday
Trump said he didn't want to make any differences with Rosenstein, but after the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate's legal committee, which at the time was listening to Kavanagh and Ms. Christie Blaise Ford's testimony on her sexual crimes.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into Kavanaugh's complaint against the FBI, and then handed it over to the Senate plenary session.
Last week, the Trump press had a crush on Sarah Sanders on Fox News.
Regarding his meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The exact date has not yet been determined, a note may be made this week, in my opinion, the meeting will be postponed to the current issues in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and we'll definitely hear the news.
Several Reporters are appealing for evidence: Sanders did not conduct a briefing at the White House after 10 September.
The owner was interested in the reason.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not related to the lack of "action" of teleporters, but also added: "I agree that this act is intended to achieve a special effect."
He later revealed that the relationship between crime and crime is growing.
“The president holds more Q<0x26>A sessions than the previous presidents,” added the respondent, and added without quoting evidence: “We have looked at their ferocity.”
In a statement, Sanders said, "If the press has the opportunity to directly ask the question of the president of the United States, it is much better than talking to me."
"We try to do a lot, and as you can see in the last few weeks a great job has been done, and we also plan to hold briefings where you will have the opportunity to directly speak to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly listens to questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions and high-ranking press conferences.
Special press conferences are rarely held.
This week in New York, the president is likely to demonstrate why ideas are free to generate and show an original image in front of reporters.
Minister of Health has written to EU employee NHS on Brexit fears
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the EU staff at the NHS in Scotland and expressed gratitude and desire for the country to maintain their jobs after Brexit.
The MSP wrote a letter to Jean Fr<0xC3><0xA9>man at least six months before the departure of the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the required compensations of applications for EU citizens working in public services.
In his letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote that "all summer talks are going on between the European Union and the United Kingdom, which is very likely to be decided in the fall."
However, the UK government is also preparing for a scenario of failure of the deal.
I understand that this can happen to you at a certain time.
Therefore, I would like to remind you once again of how I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
colleagues from the European Union and other regions share a very valuable experience and knowledge, which strengthens and improves the health performance, and benefits of our country's patients and society.
"It's actually your homeland, and we really want to stay here."
Christion Abercrum is given a surgical operation after an injury in his head
"Tennessee of State" the junior Christopher Abercrum underwent surgical operation with Vanderbilt Comodores after traumatic injury in the game ended 31-27, he said.
Tennis State's top coach, Rod Reid, told reporters that the player received a trauma before half the game.
"You came close to the line and it happened immediately," he said to Reid.
The trainers and medical staff at the hospital gave the oxygen to the place before it was moved to the cell and withdrawn for further examinations.
Tennessee's official told Harry, who was in charge of WSMV, Tennessee, that Abercrum is preparing for surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harry added that he "does not have any additional information on the injury at this point" and that the State of Tennessee is trying to establish a place of injury.
Abercrombie, a red-haired athlete, plays her first season in Tennessee after arriving in Illinois.
On Saturday, he collected an attempt to capture five balls, and in total, 18 such attempts were scored this season.
Foreign buyers will be credited with a higher sound fee when purchasing ownership in the UK
Foreign buyers will be credited with a higher wagering fee when they are buying property in the United Kingdom with extra cash that is used for the vulnerable layer in accordance with the new plan of Tor.
Move Neutralizes Corbin’s Success in Moating Young Voters
The increase in the wagering fee will be imposed on those persons who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The company expects to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
According to today's announcement by Theresa May, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher sound fee with additional cash when purchasing ownership in the UK, which is used to help homeless people.
Movement is considered as an attempt to neutralize the Korbin success of the younger voters with mortgages to provide more affordable housing and to raise citizens with high incomes.
The increase in the wagering fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK with additional funds that will help government efforts to tackle the problems of homeless citizens.
The sub-departure, which is added to the current camp fee, including high levels, which were introduced to the second housing two years ago and for renting homes, is determined by the interest rate of three percent.
The company expects to increase by 120 mln per year.
13% of London's new built real estate owners are buying non-residents, thereby increasing the prices and encouraging people to enter the sector of the first-place buyers.
Many rich areas in the country, especially the capital, have been transformed into so-called "institutional cities," since most of them are purchased by foreigners who are not present in the country.
At this stage, a new policy is being implemented following Boris Johnson's request for a reduction in theger's fee to enable young people to purchase their first housing.
He blames large developer companies for maintaining the high level of prices, and urging Ms Mae to cancel quotas for affordable housing.
Mr. Corbin made a statement on the important reforms of the real estate sector, the control of the recruitment and the completion of non-essential accommodations.
It also has the option of adding more (recommended) resources to build new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year, I tried to promise myself that I will dedicate all of my premiership to fulfilling the British dream, and life will be much better for the next generations.
This means that we will be able to re-evaluate the mistrust of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
Nevertheless, it will not be right if we will facilitate the real estate acquisition procedures for those individuals who do not reside in the UK, or foreign companies, in contrast to those who work in the UK.
"A lot of people have a dream of buying their home and staying a nightly sleep debilitating community is a reality."
Jack Ross: "I'm going to make the most of Scotland."
Sanderland's head, Jack Ross, says he has made his biggest ambition at any stage of Scottish rule.
Scott, 42, enjoys the pleasure of restoring the North-East Club, which now occupies the third place in the first league, and has dropped three points to the highest level.
This summer, he moved to the Stadium of Light in the last season of the Scottish premiere.
"I wanted to speak on behalf of my country as a player.
"I got the B limit, what I wanted," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland Sportsand.
Since childhood, I have been watching my father in Scotland in Hampden, and it brings me back to childhood.
We're going to use this opportunity only to succeed in the management of the club."
The predecessors of Ross to Sanderland were Dick Advocate, David Hayes, three Alvardasis, Martin <0xC3><0x81>neil, Roy Kene, Gus Poett, and Paolo Di Canyo.
The former Alloa Athletic says she has not felt discomfort with such celebrities while working at a large club, and has previously refused to take initiatives from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"What's wrong with me at this point in my life, do I want to go back to the drawing board?"
"If you look at the construction and infrastructure of this tower, it's undoubtedly a place in the Premier League," she says.
"It's not an easy task, but it's very likely that I'll consider myself a successful manager, and my club will be in the Premier League."
Ross began his career in management three years ago, re-establishing the position of senior co-chairman in Dubarton, and spent 15 months in the Hearts' coaching group.
He then helped to move to the third group of "Alloa" and reached the rank of Myron for St Mirren in the next season.
And Ross says he feels better than ever before playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falcon, St Mirren and the Hamilton Academy.
He tells her it's a real treat.
"I really believe that management is the right move, much more correct than the game.
It's weird, but I feel good, I get rational incomes, and I've achieved some heights.
But the game is difficult.
During the week, you will have a lot of challenges.
I will deal with this stress and pressure that is characteristic of my work, but I still feel that I have not failed in management.
I've always had a passion for this business, and now I'm working on it, and I'm happy with it."
You can listen to an extensive interview on Sportssound on Monday, September 30, between the Scottish Radio frequency between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to the survey, Saturday, 17:30 is a good time for a pint.
The summer heat wave of Niava increased the income of the British pubs, but the cargo burned to restaurant networks.
Sales in Pabe and Bars increased by 2.7 percent in July – but in revenue restaurants decreased by 4.8%, according to the calculations conducted.
Peter Martin, CGA's business consultant, who carried out the calculation, said: "Remained warm weather and participation in the unexpected World Cup for England in the unexpected England led to the same figures in July last month, which in the last month when the club's revenue increased by 28 percent, and the restaurants saw greater losses.
In June, the decline in restaurant sales was 1.8 percent higher in July.
The beer vendor pubs and pubs have cemented their position in proportion to the rates of restaurants.
Food vendors have been plagued by heat, but not too seriously, compared to restaurant operators.
In other words, people just want to get involved.
While sales of beverages in Paces and Bars have increased by 6.6 percent over the course of a month, food products sales have dropped by three percent."
RSM Tourism Analyst Paul Newman said: These results continue the trend of the last April.
The influence of weather and main social or sport events is the most important factors in the sale of domestic market.
Undoubtedly, restaurant groups continue to struggle because their sales are declining by 4.8 percent per year, which is especially painful as a result of ongoing tax deductibles.
Long hot summer is not a good time for food vendors and time shows us whether the expected moderate temperature will be grounds for inhaling in August.
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, among them new establishments, reached 2.7 percent in July, and is reflected in the development of the brand.

A study of more than 20,000 students in secondary schools showed an increase in "instagram rigged" profiles
The news raises fears that sexual content is perpetuated by the country.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "priority" page to show their parents
One out of every five children under the age of 11 create a social network account that hides their parents.
According to a study conducted by 20,000 students from secondary education institutions, an increase in "fake" profiles – is taken from the Instagram photo sharing site.
It has been shown that the fear of sexual harassment has increased.
Twenty percent of students say they use a purely "subjective" report to show their parents, and also have their personal accounts.
One parent took her 13-year-old daughter to a secret site, where the girl was offered to others to rape her.
According to a study by UK Digital Technology Awareness Workshop and independent schools directors, 40 percent of students use two profiles between the ages of 11 and 18.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is worrying when a lot of adults open online space that is not known to their parents and teachers."
Ilya Doli becomes the "Sportsmans Map" in Scottish Athletics Choir
Eilish Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as non-executive director in the governing body of the Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is a well-known Scottish athlete and chairperson. Jan Bitt has characterised this transition as a good opportunity for those who want to benefit from sports in the last decade based on their extensive experience at international level.
"William has enjoyed the great respect of Scotland, the UK, and the world athletics community, and we are confident that Scottish athletes will be useful to its appointment board," he said.
Doyle said: "I'm glad that I'm going to have to take action as athletes and I hope to contribute a lot to the development of this sport in Scotland."
An American who passed 200 and 400 metres distances in the 1996 Atlanta Games and is the owner of 4 Olympic gold, is currently a regular BBC commentator, with difficulty to move after a transitional ischemic.
He wrote on Twitter: "Just a year ago, I had a stroke.
I had to move.
The doctor will tell you when and how much time I need to take care of my health.
With great effort, I achieved complete recovery, first learned to walk, and now I'm moving on to living an active life.
Thank you for the giveaways!"
The story of a mother's love affair with her son, who lives on the internet
The company has published its findings on the web through advertising, which compares the comparison with the insects of nursing mothers.
To celebrate new initiatives, as they say it should be "the world's first silent breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie has released a promotional video video in the style of a music video used to show freedom that the new pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real moms who dance like a clay full of cows in the background with the song "Yes, I'm a sucker for milk, but you don't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not a joke, it's my boobs"
She says, "I'm going to do this, I'm going to take care of my kids, I'm going to have kids, I'm going to have kids, I'm going to have kids."
However, the ad that was posted on the company's Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reaction from the viewer, and many said it sheds light on the “dangerousness of the dairy industry”.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows in the advertising of this product.
"They need to step down and give birth to milk in order to bring out the milk, except for their children after a few days after their birth," he wrote.
Elvi<0xC3><0xA8>e's breast pump can't go unnoticed by her nursing mother in the elevator (Elvie/Mother)
Another added: "It's a bit painful for a mother as well as for her child.
But why shouldn't they use the word "supposedly" to protect the children who are being abused?
Someone once said, "That's a good idea."
One of the women had a voice, and the other said she wanted to hear the song "Sweetheart."
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
If I had been one, I would have been one.
I felt like I was a real human being.
It's a bit crazy, but I found it.
It is a generic product," writes one.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers, intended for mothers, burning milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feeling cows."
It's not a matter of retaliation or disciplinary action."
At the end of the video, it is said that women are dancing with hidden pumps in elevators.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that most women who are grieving say they feel cows.
Elvie's pump is completely inexpensive, with no wire or pipes, and runs unnoticed in the elevator, allowing women to move freely, hold their hands and even get out of the bathroom.
Anna Balarin, a partner and ECD mother commented: "Elvie's pump is so revolutionary that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
While drawing parallels between women's self-expression and older cows, we wanted to pump milk from breast milk and get all its problems to the center of attention, during which, in an entertaining and exciting way, we will demonstrate the sense of incredible freedom that will give a new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvis has hit the news headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium at the show of the designer Martha Yakbowski during the use of the product.
Hundreds of thousands of children fled peacefully to the tents camp near the border with Texas.
The number of children detained has dramatically increased, but the monthly border crossing has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration introduced strict rhetoric and politics, which made it difficult for children to place sponsors of children.
Traditionally, most sponsors were selfless immigrants who were afraid to jeopardize the possibility of being in their country when the child was asked for.
The risk rose in June, when the federal government announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their family had to submit fingerprints and transmit their data to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigrant and customs enforcement officer, testified in front of Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who demanded sponsorship of homeless minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior charges against them.
About 80 percent of the family members of the sponsors or sponsors are illegally staying in the country and a significant part of them are criminal residents.
We will continue to prosecute these people," Mr. Albenz said.
In order to speed up the process of children, new rules have been introduced by officials, according to which some of them must be brought to court within a month of their detention, not 60 days after the previous standards provided for in accordance with the asylum workers
Many will appear via videoconferencing and not in person, in order to announce their legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who don't get help will soon be deported.
According to the report of asylum workers and reports that emerged from the system over the past few months, the longer children stay in custody, the more likely they will become distracted or depressed, which can lead to violent manifestations or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these problems have been strengthened in larger institutions, such as Thornil, where signs of the child's struggle with difficulty are ignored, depending on its size.
They also added that taking their children for emotional training without giving them enough time and time to calm their friends, moving to the city of their tents could exacerbate the trauma that most of the people already are already struggling with.
The U.S., France and Turkey have called for the "occupational forces" to pull their troops out immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valed al-Mulame also called for the return of Syrian refugees, even as the country's war continues for the eighth year.
Mualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syria's soil, under the pretext of combating terrorism and "consequenced."
“They should get out immediately and without any conditions,” he told the congregation.
Mualem argued that "the terror war in Syria is almost over," where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions have been expelled from their homes since 2011.
He said that Damascus will continue this holy struggle "until the release of the entire territory of Syria" from terrorist groups and "from any illegal alien existence."
The United States has about 2,000 militants in Syria, mostly trained and trained by Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the border with France.
As for refugees, Mueller said their return conditions were good, and he accused "some Western countries" of "disrupting irrational fear" that forced refugees to return to the country
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to encourage them to return,” he said.
"They're just going to have to deal with what's going to be a hoax."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not receive any recovery assistance until the end of the war between the Assad regime and the opposition.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of the buffer zone, the last major rebel forces in Idlib, has the opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement lifted a large-scale attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
Mualem, however, stressed that the deal had "blind dates" and expressed hope that military actions would be directed against jihadists, including the Nunra-related al-Qaida front fighters, who would "be eliminated."
UN Representative Stefan de Mistura hopes to have the first meeting of a new committee soon, which will include representatives from the government and opposition to develop the country's post-war constitution and pave the way for the elections.
Mualem defined the conditions of the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the commission's activities should be limited to "examined articles of the current Constitution" and warned of interferences.
Why Trump wins for a second term
Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, if, like many liberals, the impeachment and scandal will not complete his presidency prematurely.
And, of course, there's always the "Best President of all time!"
At the moment there are no signs of aging.
Since 2014, Prime Minister Time has doubled its net worth to 1.05 million on CNN and has nearly tripled to MSNBC's 1.6 million ratings since 2014.
According to Nielsen's data, an average of 2.4 million Prime Time viewers on Fox News, which is 1.7 million compared to 4 years ago, and MSNBC's "Reichelle Madow Show" exceeded 3.5 million on the cable news evening in the ranking of the main news channel.

Beyond money, it has grown into a tough mid-term elections for the Revolution House.
Unsurprisingly, 17th districts of Pennsylvania are experiencing flow of money, thanks to restructuring of Congress election districts, who took two positions in the same battle.
This newly converted suburb of Pitsburgh surrounds the House of Representatives, the member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lambs - who won in the second round of special elections last spring.
Lemby goes against Rothfus, another senior official, who is currently the 12th district of the Old Pennsylvania, partly coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were reorganized when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January proved that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of republics.
The new 17th round led to a reduction in funding for the party's financial department, the Democratic Congress Commission (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lemby became famous in Pennsylvania, following a narrow victory in the general election in March, in the 18th District of Pennsylvania
This place has been occupied for decades and President Donald Trump beat the Republican Party with 20 points.

Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama before the partners evicted the management team of the Trump Organization.
The State Department's representatives have decided to retake the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama, "the last decision to reject Taiwan's recognition," a spokesman for the State Department, Heather Naver, said earlier this month.
But fines were given to El Salvador, who received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including financial assistance and reduced targeted visa restrictions, will be painful for Central America's countries, and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
Local meetings in accordance with development will be postponed to a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being after last year's meetings as a step forward to prevent migration to the United States.
But by the middle of September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead and actually stop discussing penalties for El Salvador.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will deliver a speech at a conference scheduled in mid-October as a sign that the administration is changing the places of gathering.
And the three American ambassadors quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without any harsh messages or punishment for Washington.
White House spokeswoman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal discussions on anonymity.
Their reports have been confirmed by a third-party analyst, who is close to the administration and who also spoke about anonymity.

The next step may be a report by a special attorney Robert Mueller on the possible instruction of Mr. Trump's justice, which is very important today in public reports.
Mr. Muller also reports that his investigation was directed at whether Mr. Trump's campaign during our elections was a conspiracy with Russia.
If the Congress passes, Mr. Trump himself finds himself in the position of accountability, as well as he is preparing to speak to voters, and ultimately facing a jury consisting of his colleagues.

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people died as a result of a strong earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palus on Friday and expected to increase the number of deaths.
Due to a cessation of communication, officials could not get information from the administration of Donggala, in the area north of Palau, which is close to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster in Palau.
Here are some important facts about Palau and Dongale, on the island of Sulvesisi:
Palau is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located on the western coast of Sulevez Island at the end of the narrow district of Sulevez, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is located 300 km (180 mi) northeast of the Sulawesi island.
The administrative region was listed below the province in 2017 by 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main areas of the Central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal zone
The province is also important for the extraction of nickel, but mainly in Morov, it is concentrated on the coast of Sulawesi.
The Indonesian Disaster Mitigation tsunami has occurred several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed the lives of more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggalo.
In 1996, the West Indies lost nine lives.
Indonesia is located in a seismic Pacific seal, where earthquakes occur on a regular basis.
There have been several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004 - On August 26, an earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Acheih Province led to a tsunami that destroyed 14 countries, killing 266,000 people on the Indian Ocean.
2005 - In late March and early April, a series of strong earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nia, on the Sumatra coast.
2006 - A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck the Indonesian island of tsunami in the southeast of Japan, triggering the tsunami that destroyed nearly 700 coastlines.
2009 - A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the West Sumatra Province near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010 - An earthquake of 7.5 magnitude occurred in the Mentawai Islands of Sumatra, an intensified tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck Pidi<0xC3><0xA9>e Jaya in Acheh, which led to the destruction and panic because it reminded people of the destruction of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
It didn't happen this time around, but more than 100 people have been killed in the earthquake.
2018 - A major earthquake on a tourist island of Indonesia kills more than 500 people, mostly north of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were left on the island.
Sarah Palin's son has been charged with domestic violence.
Former governor and vice-president candidate for Alaska, Sarah Palin's eldest son, Trek Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
29-year-old Pauline, Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, contrary to domestic violence and reports of resistance to arrest, according to a report published by the Alaska government soldiers by the Interior Ministry.

When declaring a crime in court on Saturday, he said he was “completely innocent”, reporting networks.
Palin faces a penalty of three A-class minor crimes, which means one year of imprisonment and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with class B for minor crimes, which means one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first case against the criminal justice system.
In December 2017, he was charged with his father's Todd Palin for violence.
His mother, Sarah Palim, called police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the Alaska Court of Veterans Affairs.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, for falsification of the report on domestic violence and for possession of weapons in the subject-matter of the incident.
His girlfriend said he was going to put it on the line.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for linking her child's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder in Iraq.

The federal prosecutor chooses a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City.
The federal prosecutor's office in New York calls for the death penalty for a suspected New York bombing that killed eight people - a rare sentence for federal crimes since 1953.
A 30-year-old squirrel was allegedly used to hire a home Depot car in October, along the western highway on the lower Manhattan for assaulting cyclists, pedestrians and cyclists.
Prosecutors must prove that the find "intentionally" killed 8 people and "intentionally" committed people to serious bodily injury, according to written request to execute them in a district south of New York.
Both of these are considered a possible death sentence, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal high court charged 22 charges involving eight counts of murder, attributed to Banditism used by federal prosecutors in organized criminal cases for allegations of violence and car destruction.
According to the prosecutor's office, the attack needed a "detailed planning and premeditation", in which he described how he had "grained, brutality and eroding".

Five of the dead were wild cardiac arresters.
It's been 10 years since the New York City Department of Criminal Justice has not launched a criminal case against the death penalty.
Carly Barnes was found guilty of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
In New York City, the federal case was filed in 1953 by Julius and Etel Rosenberg, a married couple accused of espionage during the Cold War by the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenberg was killed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
The resident of Uzbekistan Sipp hasn't revealed any major regrets after the attack that day and a few months later, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he did what he did very well.
According to the prosecution, Zeifov told the authorities that he was inspired after watching the ISIS video on his phone.
He also called on the Isis Hospital Room to hang up the flag, police said.
He didn't get a penalty on the 22nd offense.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders of Saifov, said they were "uncertainly disappointed" by the decision of the prosecutor's office.
"We think that the sentence for the death penalty, and not the deprivation of life without amnesty, will only prolong the trauma that has been inflicted on all participants in this incident," Paton said.
In the early days of the investigation, prosecutors had asked the defendants not to file a death sentence.
Tory MP said that Nigel Farage should be responsible for Brexit talks.
Nigel Farage has vowed to " mobilize the people's army" during a protest at a summit in Torri today.
The former British leader said that politicians "should feel the heat" from Eurosceptics - as suggested by parliamentarian Theresa May - should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bonne, a member of the Conservative Parliament, said the UK would be "Already Gone" if Mr Farage was Secretary of Brexit.
The task, however, faced by Ms. May, in line with her sharply pronounced titles, was highlighted by Pro-Remain Tor, joining a separate protest against Brexit (the exit of the UK from the European Union).
The prime minister is trying to keep his deal with the bloc's compromise plan against Brexiteers, remainers and EU attacks.
The allies argued that it would still try to deal with Brussels, despite a negative reaction - and force the Eurosceptics and the Laboratories to choose between its package and the Kao.
Mr. Bonham in Soleiho during the protest Leave Means Leave said he wanted to "enter the hatches".
He said he would become a member of the House of Commons and take responsibility for Brussels' negotiations.
"If he was responsible, we'd have to go now," he said.
Wellingboro MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we need to weaken the checkers"
When confronting the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars, in order to be obedient.
"We want to create our own laws in this country."
Mr. Bonn denied that public opinion changed after 2016: "The idea is that British people have changed their minds and should stay, it should be, it's a complete lie."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also on Mars, and reporters said, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people."
"It's hard to believe that people are not going to vote for us, our party and our activists, who are really going through the streets and are choosing us first.
"Shut up your pants and start listening to them."
In a message to Ms. Meyer, she added: “Primary ministers keep their jobs while promises are being fulfilled”.
Mr Faraj said that politicians should " feel heat" if they are going to betray the 2016 referendum decision.
"It's a matter of trust between our people - between our political class and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betrayed Brexit, and today we're here to say, 'We won't let that happen.'
In a message to enthusiastic people, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the verge of treason, to feel the heat.

Russian Grand Prix: Luis Hamilton is approaching the title of the World Cup, after the team demands him to win over Sebastian Felt.
Since last time, it has been reported that Walter Bot was ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, and Mercedes orders have played a big role in the competition.
Bottas started well and almost ran out of Hamilton, after he defended his position in the first two lanes, causing a vet to attack his teammates.
The veterinarian first entered the pitstop and left Hamilton to throw in the tail of the traffic group, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes introduced a circle with a delay and came out from the vetel, but Hamilton went ahead with several wheelbars on the wheel, leaving the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner space at the risk of retention after a double pass to protect the third corner.

President Donald Trump accused Sen. Diana Feynstein of not spreading a letter from Christina Blaise Ford, a candidate to the Supreme Court, who was accused of sexual assault by Bret Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly direct to Ford before the Senate Court Committee, instead of commenting that the events in the Senate showed that the events that took place in the Senate showed that people were "troubled, hateful and liars."
“The only thing that can happen and the wonderful thing that lasts for the past few days in the Senate is when you see anger when you see people who are angry and disgusting and deceptive and liars,” he said.
"When you see reels and leaks of information, and when they say, 'Oh, I haven't done that.
I didn't do that."
Do You Remember?
Dr. Feynman, do you have any information about it?
Don't forget the answer to your question: "Oh, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not suffocating."
Then wait for a minute.
"We didn't...we didn't spread out," he added, noting that he received impression from the senator.
A letter to Feynstein describing in detail the charges against Ford against Kavanaugh in July, which were disclosed early in September - but Finsstein denies that the leaks came from his office.
“I have not met with Dr. Ford's allegations, nor have I been circulated,” Feinstein told Hill.
"He told me it was confidential and I got it as confidential as he asked me."
But his rejection apparently didn't like the president who responded during the Saturday meeting: "I tell you it was really a bad gesture.
It may not have been the best show ever, but it's the worst I've ever seen."
With the extension of the candidacy for the Supreme Court, which accused three women of sexual assault, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations for their purposes.
"They're trying to get power back by any means.
"You see abuse, harassment, all of whom they're going to sacrifice for gaining power and control," MediaTimes reports.

Analyst releases her chronology of the night when the woman is burnt alive.
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office launched a case against a man charged with the murder of a woman who committed in 2014 in Mississippi.
The United States, an analyst at the Justice Department, Paul Rowlett, spent several hours arguing as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used mobile phone recordings to gather together the 29-year-old accused of moving the Clinton tee and the 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night when the murder occurred.
Rowlett said he received the location data from a runaway mobile phone that showed that Telia and Jessica were together in the evening of the death, contrary to previous statements made by his predecessors, Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that her cell phone was with member when she said she was at the time talking to her friend Michael Sanford, police said.
Sanford testified on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the accused asked whether Telia was telling the truth when he said that he was in a Sanford truck at night, Sanford said he was "the liar because my truck was in Nashville."
Another mismatch was that Telis said he was familiar with Chambers for about two weeks at the time of his death.
Mobile phone numbers indicate that they have only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after a certain time after Chambers' death, the Telis deleted the messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He saved his life," said Helen.

There's another black man?!
The New York Times reported that the New York Times was a "sympathetic"
New York-based nanny sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly redirected text from her mother, where she complained that she was "another black person".
Spouses deny that they are racist who compares the suit with "exercise".
Lens Plasco-Flacsman, the mother of two, expressed concern when he found out that his new childcare provider, Gisele Morris, was black when he came to her first working day in 2016.
"There's no such thing as a black man," said Plasco-Placeman in her husband's message.
But instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her two times.
After realizing the error, Plasco-Flacsman, the woman who was discovered in the spine, released Morris and said that a nanny from them, a nanny from Africa-American, did poorly for his job, and instead waited for the Philippines, according to the New York Post.
He was forced to return to work for a few days, after which he returned home with Uber.
Now Moris sued a couple for compensation for their dismissal and is demanding compensation for up to $350 a day for a six-month period on which he was initially hired but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look at how you don't do anything like this," he told the Post Friday, adding, "I know this is discrimination."
The couple responded to the allegations that they were racist by saying that the release of Morris was reasonable because they feared that they would not be able to trust him again after they insulted him.
"My husband sent him something he didn't want to say.
It's not a bad thing.
"We're not the only people in the world," said Jolie Plasko in a press release.

Your baby's name?
Well, what."
Plasko said that his wife had only two months of maternity leave and was "in a very difficult situation."
"Are you going to kill someone like that?"
That's not a bad thing," he told the banker.
Despite the fact that the trial continues, the Public Opinion Court has condemned the couple immediately on social networks, where they were accused of behavior and logic.
The publishers were afraid that the reader would not be happy to talk to them, says the new letterer.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after taking the book, wrote: "It's hard to imagine yourself instead of someone else, first of all, reading it before it is published."
Now it's really fun to know about the huge success of Paddington."
To say his father who worked as a BBC operator before inspired him to write a book on a small toy bear would be optimistic because his work was rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "Tooth-burned" was a year after his death.
On Paddington, whom he referred to as “a very important member of our family,” he added that his father kept silent on his possible success.
"He was a very quiet person and he wasn't an embarrassing person," he said.
"But since Paddington was so real to him, almost like you had a child who describes some success: you're proud of him, but it's not your doing.
I think he's seen the success of Washington.
Even though he was his own creation and his imagination, he always respected Paddington.
My son is dead and I am on my phone.
Her daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors in vain tried to save her.
"The band regularly calls her to say it's really bad that she didn't want to do it," said Ms Ednan-Laperus.
"After that, my sister called me and said she'd be dead in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her."
And I did that.
I said, "I love you very much, dear.
Soon I'll be with you.
I will be with you.
The medicines that doctors gave to his heart slowly slowed down and left his body.

He's leading the flood.
But we all must continue and fight ".

In the face of the coronavirus pandemic, the FBI is starting to investigate.
“I thought we could do what he was asking — within a limited time constraint investigation, limited scope — we could have some unity,” Mr. Fleyck said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "open up" a party for the pore.
Why didn't the FBI and the FBI take over the White House?
They don't have time for them.
By-elections will be held five weeks on November 6 - if, as expected, the case of Republicans will go badly wrong, they will seriously weaken the efforts to get the person they need to choose in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators, and lobbied them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time, and that he met his wife Ashley when he worked as a personal secretary of Bush.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
It will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Caucasian Senate will accept at least 50 votes that will allow Vice President Mike Pence to terminate the union and approve it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans sitting under the kiosk
After Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the number of apostasy from North Korea dropped, South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Beeong-sage, based on data from the South Union Ministry, said 1,127 were aborted last year, compared to 2,706 apostates in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, tightening border controls between North Korea and China and high rates of smuggled by smuggling were important factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Koreans are finally being offered South Korea's citizenship.
After the Korean War ended in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border.
Most travel through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the two Koreas, a reliable demilitarized zone (DMZ).
China considers apostates as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often accepts them for forced repatriation.
The relations between the countries of North and South, which are still in the state of war, have significantly improved over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met at a meeting in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stopped nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting of the US President, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they generally agreed to work on the Korean nuclear peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Rie Yong-ho accused the United States of sanctions because of the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such a situation, we cannot unilaterally disarm," said Mr. Rie in his address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said she was not fit to work in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader Nancy Pelosi, a candidate for the Supreme Court, calls Bret Kavanaugh a "hysterical" and said he was not fit to work in the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made a comment in an interview on the Texas Tribunne Festival in Austin on Saturday.
“I would not have been able to, but I think that if a woman turned into a filler, I would have called her ‘hysterical’, Pelosi said in response to Canadian testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanag vehemently denied allegations that he had sexual relations with Dr. Christina Belle as a teenager.
In his introduction, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost crying and drowning in conversation with his family and the school's time.
He also unequivocally condemned Democrats in the committee and called it a "coordinated murder of the grotesque and characters" organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said in his opinion that the show of Cavano confirmed that it would not work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he is biased against democracy.
"I think he's going to disqualify himself through these statements and in the way in which he went after Clinton and Democrats," he said.
Pelosi was shocked when asked if he would try to impeach Caino if he was raised, and whether Democrats would accept him in the House of Representatives.
"I will say so - if he does not tell the truth to a Congress or the FBI, then he is not suitable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he is in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the District Court of Columbia District Court.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's available medical aid law or Roy W. Weid as he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing on the approval of his position, Kavanaugh avoided questions about the matter, whether he would revoke any decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time when an hysterical, biased person will come to court and have the expectation that we will say 'How beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to use it.
It's fair to talk, for months and years of anger, and he can't show it without crying .
"We're getting married," she said, after 45 years of marriage.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "I was very helped by a woman who was somewhere in the government who said she was also crying when she was angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and began to cry, she tells the person she was talking to: 'You might think I'm bored because I'm crying.
I'm upset."
And then he just continued on his way.
And I thought it was wonderful."
Tears are allowed to express anger in part, as it is fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most bitter memories of the early work where men dominated, was when I found out that I was crying for incredulous rage once, one of the elderly women was mesmerizing at Ketchum - one cold manager, whom I was always afraid of - and that she gave birth to staircases.
"He'd never seen me before," he said.
"They don't know you're upset.
They think you will be sad and happy that they got what they wanted. "
Patricia Schroeder at the time worked with Colorado's Democratic Congressman Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart caught in the time of unregulated marriage, on a boat called Monkey Business, and left Asparesis, Ms Schroeder, very disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he should not depose his presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said after 30 years.
"In the past, he was the youngest child, but he wanted to add another child to his life.
Someone said, "A boy and a girl."
Because it was too late for the campaign and it turned out that it was behind the campaign to make a pledge that it would not take part in the race if it did not raise $2 million.
It was a wasted battle.
He found some of his supporters who gave him $1,000 to men, giving him only $250.
"You think I'm going to get a discount?" he asked.
When he spoke and said he didn't start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed with emotions - gratitude to those who supported him, frustration in the system, which made it difficult to find funds and focus on voters rather than delegates, and to focus on sexism -- that he was banging on.
"You think I had a nervous crisis," said Shreder, who had a reaction to the press on it.
"I think you're the one who said that Clint was my co-founder.
I wonder what I'm going to write about in my neck of the woods?
"Does he cry?"
How can China be good for the U.S. trade war?
The initial reasons for the trade war between the U.S. and China have shattered, and while the fight is far from over, the fever between countries in the long run can be useful for Beijing, experts say.
President Donald Trump shot the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important escalation started this week with new tariffs that have affected $200 billion ($150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing reacted every time, at least five to ten percent of the tariffs on American goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to make sure the U.S. is keeping an eye on its share, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to blink at any moment.
Coercioning back to Washington means the satisfaction of demand, but the assertion by the U.S. in public may be very embarrassing for Chinese President <0x58>i Jinping.
Experts, however, say that if Beijing can draw the right cards, the pressure of the US trade war can have a positive effect on China in a long period of time, by reducing the relationship between the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for an economic downturn in any country is actually far more dangerous than it was previously reported by the observers," said U.S. Gesey, an associate researcher focusing on Asia, the new American security center.
Syria is "ready" to get refugees, the Foreign Minister said
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntary returnees and asks for help to rebuild the war-torn country that has been devastated for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid al-Mulame said the conditions are improving in the country.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and thanks to the progress in fighting against terrorism," he said.
The government has continued to rehabilitate the territories destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
Now all conditions have been created to allow refugees to voluntarily return to the country, which had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures, which affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been expelled from the country since the war broke out in 2011.
More than six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mulame said Syria's regime would gladly receive assistance to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he said that he would not give aid to the countries that had been financed by the rebels.
