He died three years ago.
A flying bird.
Tom said Mary didn't think John did that.
The more I get, the more I lose.
I used to get used to working hard.
I don't need to answer your questions.
I thought they'd hear us.
That's very clear.
I said good-bye to Tom.
God created you with a purpose.
There's something you need to know.
I don't understand.
Where's your father?
If you're interested in telling me, then I'll give you his number.
Where's your school?
The will will be judged by the court.
God loves you.
Where did you go to school?
I've seen dogs.
The elephant eats grass.
What is that?
That could be what influence their decisions.

He's been a poor man for a long time, but now he's good.
She respected her boss, just like her father.
Do you know who broke the mirror?
I told them to send another ticket.
I said it.
You ready?
Listen carefully.
Because they're watching TV.
I'm thirsty.
I hate Tom for a lot of reasons.
Awesome!
Don't mess with me. What are you doing?
It's just a word.
Jump.
Sometimes it takes to cover the truth.
So soup is too hot. I can't eat it.
Tom warned Mary she had to do that today.
Tom really has to do that today?
It's a pit.
Tom's the guy?
Who knows?
Follow me.
Stay with your own business.
Did you eat peppers?
Mary's keeping the cherry in the woods.
Two elders.
I know.
I live here.
Open the door for love.
I'm the one they want.
These are for you.
He looked at the sky.
Don't worry.
You gotta be kidding me.
Take this.
Take care of yourself.
Are you busy?
Where are you living?
Can I borrow your phone?
Let's try something.
Tom said he asked for that.
I'm a reporter.
There's plenty of islands in the sea.
I got it!
I forgot his name.
We see things different, whether we're rich or poor.
My love for him has fallen.

I've got 100 million dollars a day.
Is it far away from here?
I'm 19.
I don't have time now.
Tom said he was happy to do it.
I won't do that.
I like your offer.
Do you think Tom can help us?
I can't eat chocolate.
Is that what you're saying?
I always liked a mysterious character.
We saw him as a good senior.
Does your husband have a lot of enemies?
We're the people who love peace.

Have you found the book that was looking for?
I just don't know what to say.
I'm learning the language.
Perfect!
I need you.
You need to control yourself.
Respect yourself, and they will respect you.
Social change is necessary for that.
What motive did Tom have to do?
He decided to be a pilot.
How's Australia?
Unbelievable!
I can't help her, even if I feel sorry for her.
That's the dumbest thing I've ever said.
Please, don't let the doves food.
I have a lot of work to do.
Shall we watch a movie right now?
The real problem is you don't even know we're in trouble.
Did you really tell Tom that?
This is a pen.
Yesterday, I ate some peppers.
I can't eat this.
Your answer's wrong.
Show me.
I'm swimming in the ocean.
We love you.

Don't worry. I'll protect you.
It's Harp.
He asked me what my name was.
Don't let the cargo go up as a very fast shell in the city that's very successful.

What do you want?
I'm hot.
There's a blue book on the table.
You can speak French.
It depends on you.
Some say you shouldn't check the email first thing in the morning.
I have time.
I'll cook.
Tom said how much time he'd be coming.
I won't die.
What do you want to eat?
Where are you in a hurry? We've got a lot of time, so we're safe driving.
It's soft and soil we're wet.
What kind of person is she?
Life is beautiful.
He bought a new car.
I'm out.
Nothing happened.
Accept what you say. I think you're wrong.
What are you talking about?
How many best friends do you have?
Free!
See, humans don't create time, because if we can, when they're not done, they're not done.
The book about the best life is life.
You're not my mother.
Tom, do you need to go?
He ran.
What is it?
Help Tom.
Tom's at school?
I'm a chef, a kitchen cook.
I don't know how I did it.
Get a job.
Why can't you come?
Nobody but Tom do that.
I like R and B.
How old are you?
Once there was a bridge here.
Do you want to do it with me?
Wow!
I'm a cop.
There's a solution.
Tom's lost.
How are your mom?
Whenever I find something I like, it's too expensive.
You missed that, didn't you?
I have the right to criticize.
I miss you.
I'm trying to look at the positive side all the time.
We'll be there at 2:30 a.m.
The Arabic language will read from right to left.
That's what Tom said.
She's smiling.
He's got a lot of money.
You can't live without water.
I won't say that.
This is a cat.
I've seen the FFF plate.
I don't blame you.
Tom's dog is bigger than Mary's dog.
I'm leaving.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get back.
We have a problem.
I'm sick.
Try it.
Why do you ask?
Can I borrow the book for a moment?
It's a TV.
The word is the foundation of language.
She's a dog.
I can't eat.
Answer the question.
What do you want from me?
How did Tom do that?
That looks good. I'll taste it.
She asked him.

Who wash your clothes for you?
They opened the door.
It's okay.
I'm a teacher.
I'm a pig fan.
I'm fine.
You should let Tom do what he wants.
No problem.
She was afraid that cancer would kill her husband before their pregnancy was born.
Any work may be painful.
I'll be fine.
He's been collecting bugs when he was a kid.
Huh?
I think it's best not to be polite.
I was in him.
Here's the lemon tree.
She's pregnant.
He believes they destroyed it.
Tom said Mary was coming for dinner.
Tom likes Mary?
The clock has two hands on it.
We went to the boat across the river.
Look out!
You bet.
I like him.
You look so pale.
You're so impatient with me.
He likes adventure.
Tom lied.
I can't eat pig meat.
The bus's here.
We're the first one.
I wonder how Tom had a reason to do that.
Please open this door.
Have you ever seen how to make a dog?
You're not gonna like this.
Don't waste your time on nonsense.
That's impossible!
Who's Tom?
I'll be there even if it rains.
Look at me when I talk to you!
Let's write what's in it.
These words are two meaning, but one situation is a really bad day.

Answer me.
Let's consider the worst thing that could happen.
I can't go.
No new book.
Are you tired?
He translated poetry.
In Canada people speak English and French.
Aren't you gonna do it?
I found that thing you've been looking for.
He doesn't know anything.
It's time to wake Tom up.
No, my passport is gone!
Most of us want to do that.

Good-bye!
It's not my fault.
He's drunk.
It's raining.
Are you writing a letter?
Hi, my name is Tom.
What do you mean?
I'm going with Tom and Mary.
Tom's not very good in French.
She'll build a good wife.
Is that you?
Tom doesn't want to talk to Mary.
We'll have lunch together at noon.
Tom fell.
Should we do this?
I'm looking for a washer for me.
What does that have to do with me?
Co-19 changed the cell cells into the virus factory.
During the summer, I went to the sea during winter, and I went to the mountains.
Have fun.
I wonder why Tom didn't come to Mary's party.
I'm Thailand.
Keep the drugs away from the hands and the eyes of the children.

You guys want to drink tea or coffee?
Tom wants you to do it.
Where did you come from?
I love you.
Do you have a pen in your car?
What time is it?

This is what it always was.
Do you like orange?
We agreed.
I like apples.

I love you more than you love me.
I lost my wallet.
Your watch is ten minutes late.
Tom ran.
Tom and I are fine.
I convinced Tom to stay in Boston until Monday.
It's cold.
If you miss your plan, you're planning to miss it.
I feel deep with you.
I only have one book.
It's not your business.
Tomorrow he's going out of Chicago.
I looked around.
I hope we didn't wake you.
I don't know if there's any time.
You should study more.
We're okay.
Tom, what do you want?
I'm faint.
He doesn't have children.
Tom!
I don't know how old she is.
Turn on the radio.
Do you like Japanese food?
Don't do that.
Who are you?
My mom's gone crazy.
I wonder where Tom gave me.
I don't eat apples.
Tom and Mary have to do that?
Is that from Tom?
My mother opened the door carefully.
Of course!
What made Tom not yesterday?
Every morning, I went out shopping every morning.
I can't live like that.
These are yours?
That's it.
I'm sad.
Where is he?
Give me a day.
I think it's right for the best.
What do you think of Tom's poem?
I'm afraid they don't get along very well.
I'm sorry. I can't go.
How lonely the world would be without you?
This chair is so comfortable.
We've got a lot of positive answers.
I'm going to let things go as they are to avoid trouble.

I like tea.
It's hard to take attention to relax, rules.
I'm a professional.

How was your job?
Tom's waveing.
I want to take a walk in the countryside.
Yeah?
Say goodbye.
Take Tom.
We should celebrate.
Everything's ready.
What are you doing?
Please come in. The door's open.
It won't happen.
