Do not forget who you are.
Tom watched Mary leave.
Tom has heard of you.
The sun is getting brighter.
He struggled to win the contest.
I had to go to the toilet.
Tom would walk.
You realize that I’m angry.

Did Tom say why he would not come?
Tom had a big explosion.
Flowers invite bees.
Do you think that he could take me there?
Should we not give up?
He arrived at Japon two years ago.
Tom was dying.
What do you have?
Tom did not feel that the idea appeals to you.
I left that behind.
I wanted to apologize for my son.

He heard.
Since Sunday was my last day, I had to wake up late in the morning.
I’m not going to think about chimney.

The rains did not stop their work.
Did he not like me?
Get out.
He asked me when to buy a new car.

The cats do not like what is read.
What worry do you have?
Tom was not a coward.
Pay me the bill.
If I were alone, I wouldn’t correct anyone.
Who is calling at this hour?
Tom did not think that this could happen.
Take your leave!
What was my room number?
I couldn’t sleep.
Tom made everyone his own.
Tom needed this.
Happy to be called, Muriel!
What would you have done?
There was no way out.
Tom closed one eye.
A little effort, it would have been successful.
Tom exploded violently.
What a huge car!
Envy.
Tom was saving money to go abroad.
He put the ring in Mary’s finger.
What about you?
What is this for?
I miss you.
Who do you not know here?
He entered through the window.
I agree with your plan.
I paid three hundred dollars for this guitar.
I was beaten up.
She was cold to me.
I do not want to live with regret for this.
