The term techological determinism embraces much in its actual application, from the point that technology operates all to the strict claim that mankind’s fate is guided by scientific logic and that it emerges from technology.

For example, someone may conclude that the presence of cars is that he tells me that there is a need to travel by road.
It is not right, however, to spend money on the roads around the country for just a few cars and to learn the new way to build a car to cut down the cost of those who want to own a car.

romanism played a major role in the culture of determinism, extolled by such writers as Geothe, Fichte, and Schlegel .
