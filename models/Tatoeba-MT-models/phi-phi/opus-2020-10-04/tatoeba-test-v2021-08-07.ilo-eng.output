Note Tom.
Water is life.
We were so exhausted that we had to spend the whole day savings.
We caught him trying to get out of his room.
We celebrated his birthday.
Let us look at November 28 as Tatoeba Day because this day Turkish, Esperanto and Greek were added.
It is better to get deeper.
To our surprise, many came.
We had three airplanes.
We have a dog.
We have work to do.
There are many factors to consider.
We had a measure of dignity to protect us.
We need to be careful.
We knew it well.
We knew what to do.
It Reaches Tatoeba!
Let us walk.
We do.
We may no longer need to sell our home.
We may not need to sign a scripture.
We moved the project to a new service.
We need to be careful.
Again we need to do so.
We need success.
We needed proof.
We need help.
You need more than ten boxes of beer for our gathering.
We must call the police.
We need to stop.
We were born between urine and takki.
We were married in October.
We are not cowards.
We were hungry.
We laughed.
Were there witnesses?
We returned to Boston in October 20th.
We were on our way.
We must go home.
He or she must get married.
We need to move about.
Now we must get out of here.
We need to start.
At times, we try to limit others by their actions.
We got started.
We tried.
We were shown.
We were searching.
We looked at each other.
We decided to drop the meeting the following Sunday.
We did nothing wrong.
We need to take action in this regard.
We wanted a government that had little to do with a moth.
What a huge car!
What a huge people!

A little effort, it would have been successful.
If it had been a little patience, you would have succeeded.
With a swift scramble, the door was cracked open!
Would you like to drink beer?
CAN you not sign our petition?
Yes, but it is?
All of you seem to be busy.
I was hardly able to find him.
You always lie to me.
Always try to get what you want.
You are beautiful.
You were guilty of murder.
You are a new student.
You are just a student.
You are very beautiful.
You realize that I’m angry.
You can add talks that you do not know how to translate.
You cannot blame them.
You are afraid again, my wife?
You would have said no.
I wish you had written down.
It is best not to go.
You do not have to tell me your name.
You drive a car.

You have to admit your burden before you can forgive.
Be cautious.

He knew that he was real.
You lack self - confidence.
You cannot guess what Tom did.
You look so beautiful.

No doubt you do.
You need new clothing.
You must be at home before midnight.

You never told me anything.
You are a coward.
Take your leave!
Take your leave!
Take responsibility for your actions.
You are their only hope.
You are a good person.
You are big.
You are just a coward.
Is it not yours?
You are the doctor.
Win.
You have a big shot.
You have a small button.
Your plans were good, but I had a better plan.
No doubt your plan will succeed.
Your plan will require a large sum of money.
Both of us face up to the problem.
Your son is very much like your father.
You have said that before.
You told us we could go.
You should not restrict a person by his creation.
You need to sleep.
All three of you are happy too.
You must be busy together.
You are too late for your job.
You can’t recognize Tom anymore.
