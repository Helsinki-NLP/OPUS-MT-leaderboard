I should be here yesterday.
It’s not heavy.
That is why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me that he probably cried.
I thought they would find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom did not want to do that.
Think seriously that Tom did so with a view to it.
You think you might be busy now.
Tom said that he thought we should do it on our own.
I think this is not the exception.

There is no need for Tom to do that.

Tom and Mary said they were ready to help me.
Tom was not the one who told me that Mary should do that.

Tom’s, a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said that they did not really expect anyone to do that.
