Norveç's rakfisk: Is this the most cool fish in the world?
Norwegian's five million people enjoy the highest standard of life, not only in Europe, but in the world.
Can the secret of the country’s success be associated with the local employees of some of the fishing fish?
Get the past pinches for a time.
Put them in the middle of the futbol for a piece.
Leave a week.
Now, you have a big Norwegian shot, a rakphosk smooth.
I'm in a little Fagernes city, about three hours away from Oslo.
She's got a great manzara, and this smell is always on the air.
Rakfisk is a fertilization of a year, depending on how cool fish you love.
When the wake of darkness and the air is cold, Norwegians are assembled here for a most famous meal.
Airard Halvarsen says, "You're eating it, and then you're eating a squander aquatic aquaint."
People around us eat little fish pieces and have a lot of drinks.
Airard says, " Some people like aquavitite more than rakfisk."
He can kill the smell.
I call a few parts.
If you can avoid taking under the blue, it's not bad, it's quite different from a suitcase after a long bus trip.
Before Rakfisk Norveç's buzzdoc, it's a very different kind of fruit in water and tunnel.
Then, when the throat is in the deepest depths of the winter, it will be brought out, and it will certainly be overcome by the inner sense.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country and often moved to the United States.
Now the people are spreading fast - more than 13% out of work, higher payments, and widespread division systems.
The old rakip and the Swedish, who is more rich than Norwegian, is in the Swedish.
Rakfisk represents something important, but it's a part of the life of Norveç's past.
It's among the most precious food you can buy.
But you'll give it to a small bargain or a sandwich $9.14.
Norwegian often doesn't come to the world's day, and most people like that.
The people here are still unwilling to talk about the name Anders Breivic, 77 men, women and children with weapons.
Instead, it's called the murder case "22 July".
The Norwegians are hard to believe that one of them could be such a murder and murder in peaceful lands.
From the beginning of 1970, the growth of one of the biggest collapses of the world has been grown from Norwegic's wealth.
Our Gasponent Anna Nordik's famous famous blue hairs, and the rakps of the ratio of the ratio of the ratio, says, "It's not the only reason we're so good that we're so good."
How do you say we are a humble people?
English, like most people here, perfect.
We're not a lot of shower, we don't like the pepper.
Norwegian was so careful that the money's little money from industrict has been distributed to the benefit of the future generation.
While the other people had no money, the world's frequent crizs were closed to the throat of Norwegian vacation.
Anna says, "We're happily happy if we can be able to get a shield to the mountains."
He adds, "Even rakphsk."
I'm standing in the snow, and I'm waiting for some food, I've eaten enough rakphsk.
Now there's a hand hamburger, of course, something different and more pleasant.
But there's more tonight of that smell fish.
One of the numbers that I'm staying on the hotel rakpsk, the guests here are the best, and maybe they're giving the burning, perhaps the most difficult.
There's a living television connection on a paponent server.
It's like the Eurovision song.
"How much do you have for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Our pants are here, Airard."
Rings, they've got heroes.
A man falls down from his chair, maybe under the influence of aquavit.
Or maybe from all the fish.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto starts hard
As the new president of Mexican Enrique Pena Nietois, Will Grant looks at the challenges of the BBC, and expects his people.
Mexico's traffic is especially bad now.
While there was a traffic city in the best time, he was led to a crazy people who had broken all the main roads since Sunday.
But the purpose was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching the meclass.
On Saturday, the new president of the Mexican Pena Nieto will take the lead of the nation.
It's a hard task.
The government of Felipe Calderon continued to have a good economic faculty, but the war of a war that led to 600,000 deaths in six years.
Mr. Pena Nieto said to the U.S. Oval officer Barack Obama to the Mexican people to reduce the violence of my government.
I'm going to give you a new security strategy to reach our purpose.
Before the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto's former political experience in Mexico.
The crowd around the capital is divided by the idea of a new leader in this country, which is grown up.
He's a huge speaker
For example, Western Valle del Bravo is remembered with love.
Those who live here are honoring him who made his television on the vacation, and he created the books.
You can go through the new roads of Mr. Pena Nieto to get to the cave.
And the plakets, who have the name, are also the foundations of the modern spot center and an impressive climate change.
"We're looking at him so that he can make a permanent change," says Mr. Pena Nieto's friend and political colleague PRI, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez.
Especially for security and economic, we hope that our country needs a very interesting and real change.
After 81 years of independent power, PRI was released by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Olvera, a district member of the convention, admits that in the 12 years after the Los Pinos President, Enrique Pennia Nieto had a lot of hope in the party.
And the opposition refuses a new president's independence.
A man who's openly called himself with a great country visa.
It's a great government man, and a man who knows to listen more than they are.
But it's not the idea that many in the other parts of the state have the idea of their old governments.
Ciudad Nezada, known as Nezaalcoyotl, couldn't have been more struggling against Valle del Bravo's parked streets.
In many ways, a banquet of Mexico City under the train.
And the problems in the capital are too difficult and city.
This year is called to help you to fight drugs with the military surroundings, and the violence against women is especially great.
The body of the woman was thrown into the body only in the empty part of a large accuracy area in the past two years.
In the time of Mr. Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, which is more than Ciududad Juarze, known as the murder of innocent women.
Those who criticize Mr. Pena Nieto were in the best way, says the woman couldn't make enough for the murder.
The worst of all, they have been accused of disregarding his rule.
She's trying to fight with her tears when she showed me the photos of Marina Luna.
According to the artificial version, Mariana was introduced in 2010.
But his family believes that he was killed by his partner.
He recalls, "When I went home, it was as if the body was washed the body. ”
There were traits that she was struggling, and death's a gravity already started.
When her mother recounted the story, she looks at Marina's picture from the wall, near a single word on it: Justice.
But he said that this family was completely unbelievable.
The government officials treated me like old accusation, a problem, an advertising person.
What they want is to do to accept people's words simplely and shut their knees.
"But it's not true when there's so much disorder and inconvenience."
President Pena Nieto comes with heavy responsibilities on Saturday.
In the past six years, tens of thousands of families were affected by the terrible crimes in Mexico, and they promised to put them first in the new president.
The PRI Council of Olvera says in Valle del Bravo, "I hope he's a president."
But the family of these victims in Ciudad Naza were most afraid.
Bradley Manning claims that Bradley didn't talk about what was bad.
Savers try to oppose Bradley Manning's claims to be bad.
Consumption focuses on the time Manning's Quantico in the military in Virginia.
Savunma wants to close the case because Manning's imprisonment was hardly hard for him.
Plays all thousands of documents in the army
The Saturday of Saturday said that Bradley Manning, who was accused of the largest secretary of the symptom of the United States, lost his chance to murmuring a few of the bad practices that he had suffered during the military guard.
F. Meade Maryland's pretending talk was Maj. When Ashden Fein Manning asked him for a frequent question, Quantico showed that he had been watching for nine months in Virginia, he did not show a refusal about the visitors of the weekly visitors.
One day when the Celsede was forced to be imprisoned, and he was forced to end Manning's case in the case of the defense.
The army arrested in June 2010 is charged to play thousands of secret documents on Irak.
Materyal was later published by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning's information source.
In Sauma, Fein studied with Maning when he was arrested in Qantico's military prison from June 2010 to April 2011, when he was in prison with maning after a meeting with Maning.
The officers asked Maning and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about forms on Saturday, Manning told me that the actions of the prisoners were "mokechemical" and that all the practices in the system were "a lot of professionals".
Forms don't make a complaint, and the officers say, even if they ask Manning a direct question about what's done.
He told me about man’s concerns, and the visitors talked about their concerns, and said that they would turn to them, but they did not have the answer.
Mann said, "You don't have what you have written, and it doesn't mean that it doesn't speak anything."
The judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why did he not murmur about the rivals that he had introduced for several months during the 2011 meeting.
Manning answered that his intention was to be removed from the "foreseen" situation.
The army said they put him in a position to protect him and others.
"I asked something to know that I was good, and I wanted to leave the POI in the case of POI... to make a taste of a life that has grown out of my mind."
Manning was arrested in Irak on Thursday, and in June 2010, Marine Base Quantico was transferred to Kuveyt, about two months before he was transferred to the military in Virginia.
She said she thought about the suicide in Kuveyt and she loved it once because she was hot.
He told him that he would not let him know what happened and what happened in the outside.
"My world's caffee, Camp Arafjon." Manning's Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cafe.
When Manning went to Quantico, he said that most of his days have been lonely in a small cell, less than 21 hours or 23 hours.
Man's only said he was given a bed, a bed, a blank, a finger-strokes, some clothes and eyes.
He said that he was trying to move on because he said that sleeping in the day, and even the rules of wake up.
Man's always slept with light from the outside of the cell.
When the prisoners returned the night, he told them that if they couldn't see his face, they woke him up and returned.
Manning's lawyer's investigation in January 2011 was independent to Manning.
On April 2011, Manning moved to Fort Leavenworth, a military prison in Kansas.
On Saturday, the judge Manning asked Manning about a question that was hardly hard to sleep in a cell in Qantico, which was hard to sleep at night, and in one morning he was trying to stand before the prisoners and others.
By the number, man said he had no chance to cover him with the battery.
The judge questioned on Saturday, Manning said he had to throw a battery from the command of the jail, but nobody had ordered to throw him.
Manning said that he was trying to wake up for the first night because of his proposal to show him no danger.
The man's officer said he could not hurt himself by using a mirror's capital, or his fingers, but he didn't do it.
Manning said he was taken from the capital of the inner wheels, the fingers and the eye cells.
The judicials hope that at least the court will at least take care of his experiences in prison, and he will lessen his sentence in the next year, which was to be executed at the beginning of the next year.
The Savunma said that Manning would accept his sin in smaller crimes and be planned to deal with a lot of crimes.
The meeting was planned to continue in the end of this week, and the prosecutors are expecting to have the issue of the issue of the overconfidence.
The Pentagon Manning said that all the most of the highest investigation rules in Qantico were complied.
Those against Manning against Manning are to help the enemy, the independent procedure is wrong on the Internet, sending national defenses of national security, and thieves or records.
If he's judged from all my legs, he's going to be in prison.
Mexican American identification crisis
Many people say that because of a limited opportunity here, they have been forced to leave Mexico.
The Mexicans are in the criticism of separation, and they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times.
Navarrette says the Mexican American Americans are struggling between two worlds.
In a nearby trip to Mexico City, I came to a group of people, and I was surprised to see.
The signs were shown in two orders: one for the Mexicanos ("Mexicanos"), and the other for the "Extranjeros" (Applause)
I stayed there for a few seconds, I wasn't sure where I was going.
Because I grew up in the center of California, I was called "Mexican" all my life.
My friends in Boston, on this ethnic steno, said to them "Island" or my friends in New York "Italian."
Then I decided in Mexico America.
But it was Mexico.
And my grandfather didn't need stenoya or hair in the country.
I was a simple America.
I'm talking Spanish, I'm fine to control the two sides of a conversation in that language.
But I don't have local words and I can't get rid of my American agent.
That's why I got my U.S. park, and I went to the order for Enjeros.
This week, when the president of the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto President Obama, I was thinking about the white Saray.
Every day, it's always always the way to move, drugs, and commercial when I meet two countries.
Pena Nieto was eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican Economy until the Mexicans try to enter the United States now.
The United States and Canada want to share in the United States and make a trade block in North America in Europe.
Pena Nieto doesn't make clear, but he swore that the Mexico will continue to fight with drug cards.
Association with the United States is full of hard feelings and negative feelings for Mexico.
Most Americans probably didn't think that the United States had taken Mexico in 1848 and was forced to force their leaders into half of their land.
But not a minute, but the Mexicans who think about some of the centuries are a reminder everywhere.
So when an American official speaks a little critical thing about Mexico, you start to hear a complaining about the Americans' in the Mexican base and among the capitals.
And Montezuma's children go to war.
And yet, the difficult relationship for Mexico is with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about bad feelings?
There's so much.
In Mexico, there are people who have a chance for the country, and people who haven't been created.
The only reason for living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, and San Antonio is that there may be only one of our parents or grandparents in Mexico and maybe their grandparents would have to stay in the north.
And mostly this guy follows a profile, a big ten, a small education, a poor village.
We are their seed, and We will say to them.
Not Mexico.
And we're not living in the American Reason now, but we can never forget the fact that we're going to go to high schools and find a good job, not Mexico, but the American Religion.
Sometimes our identity may be incomplete, but our integrity is obvious.
It's in the United States.
And we know that most of the Mexicans in the school don't love us.
That's the feeling.
They view us as a reminder of a humiliation, and they look up above us like we haven't got a bit more Mexican.
Our Spanish language will never be good enough, and our connection with Mexico isn't enough.
We're in their eyes about the failure.
If our family hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And we couldn't find ourselves close at the back of the shield, but they're still missing spirits.
My wife, born in Guadalajara, came to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that the Mexicans were more close to who the Mexicans were, and that the Mexican Americans were involved in this.
Even though he is a citizen of the United States, he views himself as part of two countries.
And most of the Mexican Americans, they don't feel like a part of the two Mexican Americans.
We like to listen to Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You're taking the best of the two worlds, but you're not a root in any of them.
We look like America in Mexico.
We are recognized as Mexican in the United States.
Just as I've learned to break the relationship now, some Mexican leaders and some of the lights want to reconnect with Diaspora.
The Mexican American Americans want to run as temporary Mexicans to show their interest in the United States.
We're going to tell the Americans how beautiful it is to visit the Americans, and we're going to force political leaders to strengthen their bond with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't happen.
There's a lot of negative feelings.
And we're not sure that it's a wonderful country with equality, and the widespread degradation and drug violence.
I'm afraid you're alone, friends.
That's right.
At least some Mexicans have not yet been ready to forgive Mexico for a fifth century ago, and then some Mexican Americans still have to admit that they still have been enraged about the behavior of their family.
Hmmm.
Maybe it's better than I thought, "We're Mexican."
Old Wars, New Middle East
The fires between Israel and Hamas can be a foundation of peace.
Can there always be peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The other blood blood is proof that this hope is empty.
Among the misfortunes, there were a lot of buildings, more than 140 Philistines and six Israelites were killed, and the first time they came near the Tel Aviv and the holy city of Israel to the city of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
But the Israelites and Philistines seemed to be stubborn in the old conflict, but there is a change in the Middle East.
The Arap frequent ceremony cheered on the air, and the Philistines and the Israelite pollution.
Maybe it makes their struggle more bloody than before.
But there are reasons to think that this could destroy their killings.
What's that won't lose?
The first looks like it's hard to justify it right now.
While it's continuing on November 21, this week's war strengthens the throats on both sides.
Since 2007, the Islamist who led Gazzaza, the leaders of Hamas, who were defeated by Gazze, will claim that the Israelites were forced to turn back.
Some of their leaders and 1,7 million people from the world's population were unable to destroy Israel Hamass.
Of course, the other part of Hamas Filistin's capitals in Fajat now won the Middle Eastern Convention in the Western Scheira.
More than that, the leaders of Hamas could make it clear that they were with the time.
As the Muslims won in Arabic, Hamas became strong and rich friends.
To Turkey Hamas's purpose, one of the most rich and most religious people in the Körfez's country, is Katar.
The people of Hamass said that he was hurled to the Syria, a Roman soldier who led a Jezbullah army around Israel from the north of Lybnan, a Muslim Muslim army, and he threatened the king of Hamas's company.
In addition to all, in the southern country of Arabs in the Arab countries of Israel, the president Christ Morsi changed the highest and most important region of the land of Mussia in Egypt.
It's just a little time for Hamass, who led Egypt for 30 years.
On the contrary, brotherly brother Hamas's cousin and leaders are more subjects on the cult.
The next diplomama can be identified as a actor, even Israel and America.
In this time, Israel's guards are going to produce the opposite consequences.
According to the soldier, he was back to the Hamas box.
Israel's Demir Kubbe's anti-fire system was valued, and most of Hamas's freaks were destroyed.
The Israelites will be more comfortable for a while.
According to Diplomatic, the American is as determined as never before, and most European countries have accused Hamas on starting the last violence.
Besides all of them, Israel was grown up under the headquarters of Minijamin Netanyahu, who had not overlooked his peace.
The rokets from Gaz have been killed over 30 Israel since 2004, but Israel was able to save a few of the Jewish farmers from the eastern part of the Philistine, who had been in the northern state of Filistin and who had continued to expand their lands, even though they continued to spread the international legal revolution.
Likud participation on January 22, Mr. Netanyahu is more comfortable when Avigdor Lieberman's war team in the western part of Livigdor.
Why are you excited to give the Philistines their own governments?
If they really manage West Shiria, wouldn't they shoot the hole like their neighbors in Gazze?
It's better to hold them behind the wall and punish them when they get their heads.
Maybe the guards can win, but Arap can change their account.
The Muslims have gained power in Egypt and the other lands are very little to love Israel, but the first priority is to deal with challenges in their home.
Israel's defense is greater than an Arab neighborhood.
Fighting with the local power will not help new Arab governments to reform their economics.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked along with Barack Obama, and maybe they could start something.
The Israelites should take care of a long time.
When the rest of the Arap world's remaining democracy, it's a bus, like a bus that was spreading in Tel Aviv in the country of Israel.
The pressure in the Jewish government is already choking the democracy and the Arab people grow up in the ratio of demography.
In a few years, there will be a diplomatic price that grows up against Hamas.
There's a need to get out of here on both sides.
Most of the two sides are announced to the external world and this newspaper, which represents the two countries that Israel represents security.
It's a little hope in a short time, that's going to make it a little more power to pressure foreigners.
Now, with Egypt, Turkey, and Katar, to stop the guns to stop the guns, it's better for the Jewish government to convince the Jews to change their idea of the earth and the commus in 1967.
And the foreign Arabs should force Hamas and Fatha to unite them.
This is more useful than a medicine procedure in BM that approaches a Philistine government.
Mr. Obama is playing a role in bringing Israel into the table.
In the first century, he ignored his plan of peace.
It looks unwilling to get in the white Saray.
He doesn't see the future in a painful way.
America has an important expense in the Middle East.
This means a peacemaker between Israel and Philistines.
Smoking packets go to Australia.
Smoking warnings and disease organs are placed in simple green boxes for all the teeth marks
In the world, the first laws of the Australian law of cigarettes and tobacco have been taken into the world, where the marka logos and colors are covered with red olive olive nuclears, and the pain of the diseased organs and their mother's smoking cigarettes.
The only difference between various health warnings and visions is to be printed with the same type of market names that will be complicated since Saturday.
It's the hardest rejim in this world to put a torture package.
Australia's federal government says the purpose of the young people to stop smoking from the habit of smoking.
This is based on scientists that if people don't start smoking until 26 years of age, they may never start.
"You can see that even when you've been very young, you know that your kids are trying to sell the telephones through the markets."
There is one of the lowest smoking in the world of Australia, and changes may be a little impression on the necks of many nations, but other lands have similar steps.
They've made it hard against the law.
He told them that if they were black, they would support the trade and make it more expensive and more cigarettes.
British American Tobacco in Australia, Scott McIntyre said, "It's going to be unnecessary results."
Those from China and Indonesia will bring more of these fruit to sell in Australia's streets.
Others say the law has increased.
Six months ago, when Zity Import is a small family company in Sandra Hatdran, he almost lost a bit of curiosity in the Britain Tobacco, Imperial Tobaco, Philip Morris and Japon Tobaco in England, when he lost the highest courts in the Sandra Hat.
He says Zico was selling more than 6,000 selling lands, and he's waiting for a new skirt.
It's a good job for us.
Experts say the plan of the potansibility is the social media in the demography.
A number of Australia lawyer banned television relaxation and sports, and asked that many of the seller's smokings were hidden from the visible places.
Australia forbidd the Internet relaxation of local colleges and sites, but the seas cannot be restricted.
Becky Freeman, a people at the University of Sydney University, said, "If you're in a minimum, you're only in this small window, and you're going to be participant."
Freeman reported that the markets are growing in social media, such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
We've got to ask this Marlboro, who really loves his smoking cigarettes and videos, or is there a banquet company?
British American Tobacco said he was focusing on the new rules before the industries of Australia.
Industry has progressed until the currency of the Industration of Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic of the Dominican Republic, and these countries claim that the trade was unfairly restricted, even though no country was in the world's Ticaret Organization.
A WTO's in the middle of 2013.
Pliber said that the government had contacts with other countries, thinking that the same supplies are the same packages.
In 2001, the first country was in Canada, who made photographs banned warnings.
Now these are scattered over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
In England, New Zelanda, South Africa, and India, there are more strong laws.
Most people in Australia are smoking.
The pictures don't touch me.
I'm overlooking them.
When she buys a packet with a mouth-fucker, Victor El Hage said, "Take a cigarette and place it."
If you should be honest, there's only one reason to leave, and that's my little girl.
In the center of Sydney, James Yu, who constructed the King of the Packet, said that it was hard to collect the traffic traffic traffic.
Yu said, "It would take me one hour before, and now it's my four hours."
He said, "The government must have been banned all the way, OK, that's all right, we're done, we're going to shut up the packet."
It's not bad in a world that is a constant diversity.
I spent five hours in the airplane when we were under the mechanical conditions and when we had to wait for another airplane.
So I've had a lot of time to think about smoking.
I won't lie to you.
Even though we've been waiting for an airplane for half a day, even though it's sorely distressing, books, magazines, and iPhone.
But in some way, some academics and physicians are commended to make a child grow.
Sometimes they say it's normal for us and our children.
He forces his brain to go to interesting tangents and maybe he's getting creativity.
And most of us don't experience the benefits of flashing because we're connected to another screen.
So we should be hungry, huh?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll be back to this.
First of all, I thought it was a new idea that it's like a lot of people, like many people.
In Calgary University in Canada, a professor of Greece and Roman historical Professor Peter Toohley, who is not a professor of life.
He said, "It's really a long time for you to get through."
Pompei's walls have a Latin wall written on the first century.
Then we're going to explain how we're going on.
The problem is, it's been identified in many different ways, and it's discussed by Ontario in the University of Canada, John D. Eastwood, a psychology psychology.
After looking at the research literatist and put the idea before a group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues said that it was a "noying but satisfying."
It's something that's not busy, but it doesn't want to be.
He said there's no way to do anything in the capital.
The corpse experience of suffering said, "That's a good sense of timing and a slowness of time is the disturbing process."
The pain can be like a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood may be involved, but the people who are frequently trying to see the problem as a circuit or the world, but people in depression view their problem as themselves.
Sometimes we think we're strained when we're trying to be a consent.
In September September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues suggested that the "Certain Uncle National Science: Definitely Not to Define Suffering" was published in the journals of a journal reader's news story.
Some groups heard a high voice and interesting television program in the side of the room, and others heard it as little as little as little as they could, but the third group never heard.
Those who heard a low-level television reported more severely than two other groups, they found it difficult to be a concentration, but they didn't know why it was.
One of the work authors, and Mark Fenske, from the Guelph University in Ontario, said, is a problem when you try to focus on a hard or busy task.
On the other hand, when you read something that can help you to look at bad tools in a fabric band, and music that distracts your attention.
In fact, the leprosy, which often appears to be a sign of distress, can make people more physically obscure.
Professor Fenske said, "The investigation has shown that the kids who have been allowed to move on have more than they have learned and have received more information."
We're all experiencing suffering in some parts of the planet, a monoton speaker, a flash movie.
But some people's in a more competitive enthusiastic enthusiasm by others.
In the 1980s, the researchers had developed a "Scadeal Educational Scheduling".
And there's a lot of things I have to do, "I have a lot of interest, I don't have time to do."
In West Florida University psychology professor Stephen Vodanovich, the researcher Steven Vodanovich, found that man has the ability to have more and more to need more external investment than the girls.
But it's usually a small group of teenagers.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor in Illinois's University, interviewed with a number of 400-year-old men and mothers every day.
The 32 percent of Ergenes found that they were flying at school and paying at school only 23% when they weren't at school.
On the other hand, they said 3 percent of their parents were stuck.
Professor Larson said that 21 years later, they didn't know whether they would be lower or lower.
But the kids and kids don't have control over what they want to do, so they know that "there's a bad period of adolescence."
That's why I'm back to my first question: Is it good for people to suffer?
No, because scientists sometimes show that when they are excessive, people can enter physical dangers, gambling, or use of material.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who has been working over two decades, said that many philosophers and writers are discussing the connection between creativity and creation.
Gary Marcus, a psychological professor in N.Y.U. said, "It's a way to tell you that you should do something else."
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you're struggling and use this energy to steal and eat, you'll be happy.
But if you watch the television, it can make you happy a little while, but it doesn't happen long.
So if your kids are hard to give him a iPad, he's not going to be troubled, but he says, Professor Fenske.
And he said, "It's going to be transferred to another situation."
Your kid doesn't just learn to be fun, but he's controlling himself in other areas.
I don't think we really want to be happy.
We shouldn't be so critical.
Rather, our objective should be to be far away from being free from playing the optimism and technologies about the technical and the technology.
Professor Eastwood joined.
He said, "We need to make it more exploited, but it's the desire to be close to something hurtful and depressed."

No Senaryo for New Marihuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a 19-eastern college student in Colorado, and a futball player in the country soon will be charged with something to be legally executed.
In September, Mr. Orosco told him that he and his friends were stopped in Lamar, near the border of Kansas.
When the police officer found the marihuana in the car, Mr. Orosco each of them received a call for a $100 total crimes, movement and drug tools, and the court history was given.
He said, "It was treated us like a criminal."
But is that someone?
The answer of a hundred little drug case of Colorado to make a conscientious use of fun.
Hundreds of frequent marijuana's case is already closed in Washington's state, which confirms a similar prediction.
The police units are 21 years old, and the adults in the weeks of the weeks, when the laws were performed, he left the charge to carry a small scale that would be approved.
But the prosecutors in Colorado, in more reliable areas, swore to keep the current marijuana cases, and they still invite people to the court for moving.
Also, they use the wave to prevent the lisans of the new lisans from the literary litrees from Denver to the West Mountains.
The police officer of Denver's eastern Aurora said, "I don't know what this is going to happen so quickly."
The editors in Washington State are shifting their heads.
And they're looking for a lisans system to build the production, planning, distribution, and selling in December 1, 2013.
Well, I'm using Colorado first or first, and now they're saying that there's a lot of creativity on the medicine in the medicine.
The Washington Eyalth Committee speaker Brian E. Smith said, "Colorado has a regular physician, so they will be a better guide."
But no place or system doesn't do more than tell us what's going to do. Mr. Smith.
He said, "There's no real example we're going to get it."
The law called Washington's I-502 law will be acting in December 6 December, and the state lisans system hasn't yet existed, but it will leave a definite year to move.
There are hard mechanical questions to solve during this period, like the restrictions of schools, parks, child parks, or child-cleaning lint marijuana, in license, the liquia, the limania, the liquia.
The new investigation group Ben Livingston said, "It is not hard to find a license in anywhere, especially the area of Seattle.
On November 21, the chief officer of Aurora sent an e-mail to the officers of the city's lawyer, who will not have a 21-year-year-old, and the police will let the people stop the crimes.
The chief Oates told us that the medicine medicine was going to make laws and follow the drug traffickers and sellers.
In North Colorado, the district officer of the West, Ken Buck, represents a more strong idea.
He said that his office would often continue watching the cases of the marijuana, as a way to force the users to heal.
Now, when 119 people are charged to move to two tens or less marijuana, many of them have been charged with other crimes.
Mr. Buck said, "Our office has a challenge to succumb to crimes in the case of the situation."
Even in lands, in the village of Mesa region, the provinces who refused the marijuana's attempts, the answer was hard.
The police in Grand Junction in the largest city of the region are not present to the adults.
Pete Hautzinger, the district of the region, supported that decision, but he decided not to stop the movement.
He said, "I don't think I'm spending my time with continuing to follow the law."
The 55 percent of those playing in Colorado, but it wouldn't be easy to put the funny marijuana into the government and legal system.
And the dissension in the state of the state brings a deep conflict between the local authorities about the largest green neuron of the country.
Denverian lawyer and Marihuana, who represents the lawyer, says Sean McAllister, says the local Organization of the Reformu National Organization.
He said, "They have spent much of their lives in court, so they don't still recognize that this is legal."
In the first part of Marijuana, in the first part of the world, Colorado and Washington, are ready to be national tests on administrating drugs.
The lawyers and government officials are also waiting for a new set of restrictions for legal merihuana, and they are expecting a federal government who plans to approach them as a federal crime.
He hopes that the lawyer's accompanied merchants are looking back to the Republic of Justice.
Despite the medical marijuana and the physicians were arrested with high profile, the federal government permitted the medicine marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and in 16 other countries.
In Obama, a former drug politician of Kevin A. Sabe will probably not be able to smooth the doors of drugs, but they will not allow them to be allowed to make fun of the country where the revolution is given by new laws.
Some towns in Colorado don't expect federal governments to move.
Even before the voyage of the Decision, some local governments agreed that the new marijuana, a year more than a year, to open it.
Montrose, last week, brought a six - month ban on Montrose city, and it's important to accept the next week.
Bob Nicholson, a member of the city's Council, said, "We don't want to get someone license to get a big federal problem."
Our region used a vote against the change.
We're looking at the area playing against the government.
There's a lot of questions.

It's not because I'm a little weird name or because I'm coming from a special school.
I was just judged for only one reason, and this was a shift and a barbert in the beach of this word. Dad, my father, Woodrow Wyat, Margaret Thatcher was a high-of-profit, and I was supporting the Muhahazazazaars.
You can ask why I've opened this.

I've been a single person in the first few weeks in Oxford.
In September 1986, I was ashamed at 18 years of age.
It was the most fierce time against the Party.
The past year, because of their university higher education, the old student Margaret Thatch graduated to renounce his honor.
This atmosphere was frightened by a Stalin frightening.

This was a second class of English students named James who identified himself as a OUCA member.

That's not enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatch, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the doctors are doing the first class class, like the workroom party.
Then I tried to make a traffic in a local bar, fearful.

One of the first class students found in Eton, the first class, said, "You are a fascinating dollar girl."
You're kicked.
The other disciples were holding them.
I'm wrong, I was dirty.
Somebody asked, "How do the people have sex?"
They're striking each other, aren't they?
I felt like homosexuals felt before the liberal law of the gold.
Would I ever have been able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been trying to meet people with the same idea only when they're dark?
Would I go back to the college party?
Three years behind me were like a transport and loneliness.
The only public report in my college was Norman Stone.

It's short.
Oxford was my dad who shot at my career.
Then, she wrote two centres each week in Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I slipped inside, and those behind me were down in five minutes.
When they went, I prepared a brush, and I got the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a smell.
But no one should be scared and scared in an 18-year-old education.
More tragedy, Oxford's 14 capital capital of Oxford is a curtain and a equality that doesn't deserve this day.

What's Maullen's a precaution?
A MALLNA'S SSK is nearly 60 percent of the age of freezing age, and the SSK and the probability of the United National Court, which is considered in the law of the SGK requirements that they have been able to handle the lives of the SSK and the life of the Cyclopedia.
In contrast with the workmates mentioned above, they are still able to revenge if they lose their ability to earn their jobs in a position where they can't do.
Who's counted as a bullshit?
I write from the Diarbakur, my name is Mehmet Gullin, I have 920 days and I have a jury in 540 days, and I have 1460 days with my soldiers.
Also, I'm a brush disease.
I'm connecting to the dialias machine.
I'm still working at a workplace.
Can I have a wealthy month?
- May Mehmet Bey be the first time.
You didn't tell the first time when you were working in your problem.
But let's tell you how to connect the wealthy month.
First of all, the conditions given in the law have to be investigated for over 10 years and have to be a whole day of 1800 days.
Also, when SGK is discovered that you're at least 60 percent of your work forces, or your work accident, or a job disease, you're almost 60 percent of the power to win in the medicine.
But, because you're a dialiased, you're giving 60 percent of the number of primary days here, you can't connect the month because you don't fill the number of 1800 primary days.
Of course, we don't know how long you're working.
The day you're finished for 10 years and 1800 days in the day you're finished, you're going to have a month in the SGK.
The Challenge of Material Real Efforts
Is it not possible for anyone who hasn't been registered for 10 years, 1800 days, who hasn't been in the financial license?
- 1800 days must be finished.
But there's only one constitute, and he's connected to the report of the receptive conditions for those who decide to have a regular need for someone.
It will be discussed in the following chapters of the books that we will see in which people will always need their care.
The condition of those who have been fertilized before starting to work
I'm Ahmet Gyeler.
Although I'm carrying all the conditions in the SGK law, they said to me, "You can't take the money before I first entered the job.
I'm so lucky.
It's not wrong, isn't it?
How am I going to be exhausted?
Ahmet Bey, you have written all your circumstances in the Law, but one of the conditions in the law and the SSK and the Uncle of Mountains who are in the law must not have been available before the loss of a disease in the work.
Because you don't move this condition, the wealthy month can't be connected.
But you can resent you when you carry the procedure conditions.
- I've got 3980 days, and I've been insurance for 16 years.
The SGK was identified before I entered the work.
They said to me, "You can't have the money.
I'll do what in this case.
I'm not going to be working.
Will you guide me?
- Yeah, you heard it right.
You can't be free.
But in the SGK law, there's a reception registration.
Well, there's two cases before October 2008 and later.
If you start working the first time before this date, SGK will determine that you're investigated for 15 years before you're working, you can take a half of the age of average and the number of 3600 prim days.
So we'll recommend you to be in the monthly sum of a nearest SGK administrator.
- Well, if you had been working in 2008, you could have been able to have an aged month in which you had been investigated for less than ten years, and at least 3960 days of financial wealth, old age and death.
Do you have to leave the job?
I'm still working in a workplace as a driver.
When I went to the hospital, he's got me a cancer.
Malulen I want to be free.
Should I leave the job?
Can't I use the wealthy month without leaving?
I don't want to stay without work until the month is connected.
- You've heard it right.
You need to leave the job to give you a monthly connection.
But before you go to the month, you have to count it in the law of SGK.
But if you have wealth, you will have a month.
There's no meaning for giving a monthly connecting, you have risks to stay without work.
That's enough for you to be 1800 days.
When you go to SGK, you're going to find out my wealth, SGK will lead you to one of the doctors sent.
And when you get the health report you get from here, SGK will examine this report in your own health installation, and if your cancer is determined that your medicine's power has affected over 60 percent, it will be a cause for you to be connected.
But if you have to fill the ten years of independence, you'll be able to connect you for a month.
I mean, it's not wise to tell you that the SGK colleagues who work investigate the SGK's health medicine, without seeing the decision of "You're unsteady."
But if the SGK is carrying all kinds of conditions that do not work, it's the same time that the SGK will be able to determine the financial situation and connect the monthly connection.
If that's the case, if it's a wealthy, and other circumstances, it can be useful for him to start a little early morning.
Will the captain of the team be registered?
I'm a connect- Kur's investigation.
I'm throwing all the conditions.
But they said, 'I'm borrowing, you're not going to pay the money.
I have to do what.
- I'm a precious reader.
Who told you he was right.
You don't write what the other conditions are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, the law is hard to pay your debt.
But I can give you a special tea.
I'll advise you to pay your debts by means of the banks or such coins.
How early the morning is the morning, it takes so much months, and you'll pay your debt a little while.
These organisms are easy to pay for what you have done.
What statistics is connected to the wealthy month?
I worked as a SSK as well as a team and a team number.
Where's the moon going to connect me?
I'm highly read, if you work on a more than one statute, the U.S., and the SSK, you're going to be connected as the last investigation. So if you're just the last of the SSK, you'll leave a job and carrying other conditions from the SSK.
Original SGK reports in SGK
How's the money supplies?
Which patients can I get a health report?
- You need to use social security engineers or social security centers for health reports.
SGK will lead you to the hospitals of the University, except for the University and Vacational Civility, to the hospitals of the Turk Silah Civil Civil.
But if these patients are not available in the country, they can also be sent to the full-fected patients of health care.
Isn't it possible to move to a special hospital?
- It's only possible.
In the old arrangement, the reports of the medicine is also applied to the medicines, and the life - threatening patients, who are infected with a new administration with SGK, with a new addiction infant in medicine in medicine in 01.09.2013.13.
What conditions are called for love operations?
The SEVK propin is enough to make 1800 primins to determine the independent condition of the SEVK procedure.
The currency curves will be paid by SGK.
And it's not gonna be called for ten years of rigidness.
In the case of a financial connection, if a person is in need, he's only a monthly connected to the medicine report for the ten - year period of investigation investigation.
So when the first time a person is identified by his material resources, he's going to look at SGK only on the days of 1800.

In the writing, it is asked to tell the person who finds the poison, where, when, and how he finds it.
It's also cheering in the pocket to pay for a colleague and mail payment.
In New Jersey, a 16 - August 1963, a total of 16 miles (35 km) away from the ocean in the New Jersey City, was given to the owner in the last days.
Comsa, who was 12 years old in 1963, pointed out that it was a surprise to see the ocean, and said, "I was thrown into the water, thinking that some of them would find it, but I never thought it would return to me."
The sound frequency is in love.
I was surprised to see what the first sound engineers were to do with the Pamir sound frequency of Turkey.
When the sound technologies or the sound engineering, it's probably the sound systems of everybody's thinking about music.
But did you know that the terrorism can prevent you from interfering with sound technology, the point frequency of a sound frequency, that you might be able to introduce someone you want to, a secret, or a recipient of the world's rituals?
After Pamir finished the University of Billing Mimari University, the sound engine from the CSE college in England and made the audio technology on the Middlesex University.
The Communication Technology Technology Academia in Galilee also produces audio engines, audio technology, performances, electronic music, and advance recording technologies.
Territory submistry message
"What's the sound technologies?"
"A technology that can be used in many areas in the world.
Our brain understands everything with electric scales.
And the sound frequency is a type of electric accelerator, energy.
By using this energy, you can change people's altogether, you can move on with the command you want."
One of the most important substances of the audio technology is the subsequent message.
It's put in a frequency message in a music or song, except the limit of humanity, but it doesn't define it by high memory, but it goes down to the bottom.
For example, when a terrorist attack was taken, Pamir said that he could make a music literature in that area.
If a message is replaced by the license of the printed song, it's a message like "Do not do this" in the terrorist alphabet.
He doesn't understand what he hears, but his substantial memory gets to see it and it's a voice from the inside, "Don't."
He sees it to him as a message from Allah.
But in the world and Turkey, these messages are banned and punished without the security of the people.
And from the Sweden Pamir is a subsequent message that has been prepared to tell the students about the subject in the Stanbul Technology University only once.
"I listened to a music at the time of the Conferans.
I put a sound frequency in the music called "Suu'".
At the end of the presentation, I asked students if they were suspicious and suspicious.
They said that they're so thirsty in some way."
According to Pamir, there are people who use a liminal message, saying, "We've found that some radio channels have made it, but the details are not yet known.
In Germany there is a channel called "Kara Audioin Radiosu", a radical fertilization of Islam.
It's spreading messages that are excessive, industrious, industrious, industrious, fighter, who promote drugs.
And the German police know this, and the Turkey police know it, but they can't start because they change frequency."
Also, in the music world, these dangerous messages are used.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal groups...
According to this, there was no terrorist in the waves, and it was performed by the sublime commands that were sounded in the underlying pilots.
Password table
The audio technology can also be used in crimes.
In the United States, it's particularly useful for the bank banquet.
For example, when the police's telephone, the voice engineers are able to determine where a person on the phone is on the bank, where he's on the bank.
It's different when a sound is hit by metale, tag, plastics, walls, or something else.
It's also possible to define the size of the room that the sound is composed according to the format of the sound, even to define the shape of the room, which is the shape of the room.
So the body of the criminal is able to determine which types of items are, how large and in a room.
And there was a computer program that used to do so, and Pamir even made an opera building from Tataria, and I thought "I could have a perfect sound order if the 175 folders were put into the building."
It's not a prime technology, but it's worth 4-50,000.
The sound frequency is also used in the mimari and deterioration.
Pamir has a lot of work on this.
For example, in a restaurant, in a restaurant of high-hour meeting, the sound table cannot be out of the sound table.
Only those on the table can hear the talks.
Someone on the other side can't hear anything that's talking on the table.
The general system of these different orders is: "If you want to destroy a sound, you can compare it with the same molecule structure in the same frekans, and you can turn it into a warmer sound of the current sound.
Nobody could go on the plane without this system.
Because the voice of the plane engines is high enough to be able to endure.
These sounds in the plane are blown up, and they destroy themselves.
Even if this system and your windows are open, you can make a peaceful environment in your house.
Did the Egyptian piamits be sounded up?
There's also other interesting things that Pamir did with the first sound engineers of Turkey.
For example, he made an arrangement in a clear air disk in the Movale, where the music can't be heard from the outside.
The sound cannot go beyond the border, compare with another sound frequency.
If he asks, even in a room, he can be silenced after a certain line.
Pamir also made a spontaneous graduation for sports and concert.
It's a couple of use.
Because you need a basketball playing, but you need to have no concert.
In the openhava concentration camps, only a sound quality of music can be sounded only with sound technologies.
"We use frequent frequency to destroy the sounds of sounds that seem to be unreasonable, reform the human traits, so that your music gets clearer.
MTV's too much about this.
The openhava conservators are organized and they're sounding like a studio record."
That's what Tybitak did.
Dispose two album levels with sound frequency.
There were scientists who claimed that the Egyptian pyramids were sounded.
They thought the Taghs could be lifted up by the sound.
I'm asking you, "Isn't it free to use bad motives?"
"I'm so afraid when I read the work of the University on the Internet or because others would read it."
'Cause if the writings are even tested by well - intentioned people, they can lead to unsuccessful results.'
"Full Arabic"
Sweden Pamir explains why this is because all the sounds of the voices that you hear are on your brain.
True, man hears the voice of a single consent, but the other sounds are actually transmitting to his brain, and he's tired.
It needs to be empty, so it's good to walk on the earth, and do the natural moves.
I think it's supposed to be set up in schools to suppress the voice.
So the student will be conferred in the voice of a teacher and can have a long concentration."
Pamir says that the sound frequency of the sound frequency is a very rich frequency of the Arabic frequency, and he observes that the sounds are ordered to put a very good effect on the side of the sound.
"I need to read a voice of prayer, and when I read Jasin's trust, I think I'm thinking."
Love pattern with frequency
"Can there be anybody in love with sound frequency?"
Don't investigate in the love of Pamir, the frequency of the person's feelings, says, "You must first find a frequency that you want to talk to someone you want to love.
You can influence it by using a higher frequency than this frequency.
Consider, for example, 300 of the man’s traffic frequency.
And you want to play a music that can make your feelings impressive.
And if you drop down the power of those who're playing on the 300 frequency of the music, and you're able to make a double number of people.
Maybe it could be a love for anyone who's standing on that moment."
And Pamir, who mentions special sound systems in the world to be more effective to speak, can feel as a politician, as a politician, as a politician, as a politician of nature.
And the answer of Pamir's answer is, "It's a voice near to the voice of a man's voice, because it's most impressive."
It's as if it were created from a human breath."
"The Golden Defenses will be up."
Canadian Jennings Capital Inc.
In the first half of the world's fertilization in the world's fertilization tool, the first half of the year of the world’s fertilization, and the growth of the AA investigation in the payment of the payment of the prices, as it appears to be, as if it were, in Hrushewski, China, and India, supporting the traits of the fantasms of gold and the traffickers, and the traffickers of the China.
He remembers that Hindistan was the biggest gold alternateer of India, and he said, "I believe their attempts to undermine the government by restricting the gold epidemics of the machines, and now it's no more rapidly.
People'll find a way in this box."
Hrushewsky suggests that they should make a long summer supplies, saying, "Alt, it will continue to serve as a safe builder.
It's forgetful of the expenses that have many Western governments.
The governments try to reduce their debts by decreasing the value of money units.
So the gold prices will be upside down from the current level."
"In a short time, gold, the ability to reduce the risks of the piace."
The World Revealing Grubb, the Grubber Marcus Grubb, says that it is a physical creature who offers the finances of finances and volatile probability, which is more complicated and more complicated than a finance and trustable physics, "If you're not going to fall in the vacation of gold, the basic features of gold and the risks of the purchasic risks of the world's.
The gold portflage, with small numbers, shows that the literary is improved, has often proved that it's better to cope with more stability and inconveniences."
Grubb, who points out that the Golden Age has been lifted up in the last ten years, says, "Although, the whole world's nuclear products are depicted less than 1 percent.
This means that the pyramids are still important to grow up in the golden bucket.
In this cycle, 78 percent more than 78 percent of gold and scale, in the last year, is evidence that the shield is protected by the investigation of the investigation.
"Hindia has to multiply national gold tablets to support financial growth."
Grubb, who answers the biggest gold piano of the world to Hindistan and China, has encouraged in the second milk of the sixth price of the gold, the talents of gold and scales in the second year of the Asia, to increase the expenses of the expenses in Asia.
Grubb, he reminded of the 54 percent of China's mechanism, and in India, 51 percent increases.
Grubb said that when the Chinese cheapers bought gold from the lower price, they sold their sellings, if there was a higher trend, they would be quiet at the second part of the China.
When the gold prices fell unexpectedly on April, the quarrel took place, and the cubits fell fast."
In Grubb, in India, in India, the government has a lot of preparations to support the Republic Bank and decrease in the six perimeters of the Alted Bank.
The world believes that the Golden Consey should be viewed as a strategic policies in India.
And in addition, in order to support financial growth in the long-time political politics, he has to multiply the national gold tables.
Global Alternatives
The World Revealed World Convention of the World Trends reported that in the second summer of this year, there were 508 tons of the whole world’s 856 to3 tons, global sikke and clusters.
In the second year of the country, a significant increase in the country, according to the same year in the past year, the celebration was 54 percent in China, in India, in India, 38 percent, and 38 percent in the eastern East.
In the same year, in China, the expansion of the investigation in China has grown strongly, and it has increased the same amount of gold as the last year that the equivalent of the prices would grow in the future, and it has reached 276 tons of 276 tons.
In India, the government raised up taxes in order to prevent the first gold colleague, but in the past year, the expenses increased 310 tons.

In Trabzon's Czech Republic, 12 September 1980, is the subject of the film of what happened at the end of the 1980 Cyclopedia:
"Filmin's main character is working in Germany's father of young wisdom.
One of the biggest dreams of the wisdom in the winter school and in the summer months is to be a doctor.
But it's not a lot of events to read and work.
And it's always hard to do with the love she loved Zuleyha, the most rich family of the village's family.
This love she has been hiding for years, under Zulylyha's father, Sabri Ain.
There are other plans for Sabrie Aa's daughter.
On the other hand, there is one of the biggest 'tepe' they' in the surrounding villages, one of the biggest catastrophes, and it's a war against the villages.
Long metraja from a short movie...
In Galada, the artist and the leader Dr. Iismet Eraba's small floor, explained about 1980:
"When we started this movie, our goal was to make a short movie.
But he saw the first shifts in social media so much so much that we started to be excited to get us to a long metraj.
And when we went to a district company, they said, "Do you have a vocabulary?"
I said, "We don't have any credit, but I have 86 black 86 players you can't find anywhere."
The films and televisions that have been used so badly on this day, and they've been misrepresented to the blackman.
You'll watch the 86 original Karadeniz in the movie.
I tried to get a blacker movie.
I wish the others had brought before me, but we would have watched an unbeliever movie.
It wasn't wrong to tell the black man, but I wouldn't have put that movie on me.
We first put a Turkish record in the Turkish movie.
That's gonna be the first one.
That's what we did to get better the seat.
And we also put the English talk statues in the movie, and we set up subscriptions that were translated into the Karadeniz.
If we turn the camera back to this movie, the player came out.
It's our first movie.
My faults may be missing."
Don't miss this fucking movie that brings a new squad film to the blackening movies!

Problems in the Smoking of Smoking
In Turkey in the first six months of this year, 10 percent less than the same year, with 41 milliards of 779 million independence.
In Turkey in the first six months of this year, 10 percent lessened by the same year of the past year, and they returned 41 billion to 779 million 1900,000 in 560.
According to the Court and Alkol Piano (TAPDK), the University Instructional Instruction of Turkey was finished by the University Education of the University Instruction in Turkey to make a decision for adults in Turkey.
According to the scientists, the most commonly 15 percent of the Turkey, and more than 16 million people, every day and every day, that is 27,1 (14,8 million) in 2012, and the exploitation of the smooth production was reduced to 13.4 percent.
The men's 41 percent,5, and women's 131's cigarettes.
The number of those using the milk is 47% from 47,9% to 41,5, and in women is 15,2 percent of 131 percent.
According to research, ten of those who use the tobacco products, six of them think they're thinking to quit smoking.
The number of those who were planning to leave the milk in a month was exposed to 35 percent of those who planned to leave it in 129 and 12 months.
And in the research, there's the following ideas:
"The crucial result of the exploitation of the socket products defines the law of tobacco and the Universal Control Program and the Plan of Action.
Thus, the number of those expenses has been reduced from 2008 to 2012 to 2,2000,000, and the use is reduced to 4,1 percent.
According to the 2013 World Encyclopedia Criteria, the World Encyclopedia Criteria was the first and one country that gave the Turkey the highest level of control of the teeth.
The report was asked to follow Turkey and follow the example."
The law of smoking is still being influenced in decent areas.
During the first six months of this year, the smoking amount of cigarettes was reduced by 10 percent of the last year, and it was reinstated for 41 billion.79 million 1900,000.
This number had 46 billion in the same time of 2012.
The walls will be locked screen!
Ubi Interactivity gave up a very interesting expense using Microsoft's 'Kintene' technology.
The year we spent to support Kintes for the Windows projects, the 11 new company included the Kincle driving program.
The software had money, the earth, the device support for these companys.
One of the most interesting software demographed by the Kincle Accelerator was shown by Ubi Interactive.
A simple projector in Demoda meets Kinque for Windows and the projects in the wall are converted to an unusual lock screen.
A new sending on Windows website has a few companies to test this technology.
The software which tests the ceremonies on the ceremonies over 50, now is trading to everybody by Ubi.
It's possible to get the payments from Ubi's web site.
You have to check the 149 dollars for a 45-ch-unch screen.
A 100-hour locking screen that can be detected from 20 points, and you'll have 1.49 dollars.
You need to buy Ubi's software and Kinque for Windows's prices, but you have to buy the projector separately.
Another new to Android!
Google will make it easier for this patent to get the 'dos and send-adder' with this patent.
The patent of a new International technology, which was the first time with Android in the mobile operations, took a new International Technology to work with friends.
It's not quite different from Android Beam and Apple Airdrop's examples, such as NFC and blue.
The last renewed in Google signature, which allows you to distribute the group of users around the world and offers it to the users to leave it easy to leave.
It's as if you're going to get a new feature in the future, and you're sure that you're going to get in the Android versions...
Here's the first local phone of Turkey.
Turkcell, too, went into a smart phone.
It's gonna be in Turkey the curiosity of the smart phones to be shared with China.
T40's name
Turkcell explained the first local phone of Turkcell.
TCELL will finally offer TCELL the smart phone that will be produced in Turkey and with China in Turkey.
Turkcell University Ciliv, U.S.A., was developed by the medium collaborator of the U.S.A., and in February, they planned to sell T40 in Turkcell's work.
Cilivia, who made a presentation in the T40s, said that they also have contact with the Turk productors, said, "The part of the T40s is in China, and it's going to be constructed in Turkey until 2013.
HOW WOULD YOU ANSWER
Cilvie, who told me that they would give the telephone with a fair price, she told them that they would be going to spread the price near the price.
The Cilivia said that they're going to make more use of data and expanding their money by giving them more effectively than using T40s and capital phones.
Cilivia said that Turkcell's traffic trade since 2010 was sold from one million advertising mobile phones, said that these sellers were sold out of half 500 million pounds.
A PUBLISHER IN THE FREQUENT ASKED QUESTIONS
Turkcell Global Committee Ciliv, T40 will be like a voice of voice, a sound, a surrounding sound, and a configurable user interface.
Ciliv said that before T40's payment was to be expounded, the telephone price would be appropriate.
SOME PEOPLE AND DEATH
57 percent of the technologies and Communication Committee (BTK) said that they support the local procedure.
The minimum cost of the telephones that were sold because of the increase.
We're driving a 15 million dollars every year, and I'm worried that it's going to increase."
T40, Qualcomm, who will work at the Android operating system will have a pair of corporate processor and 1 GB RAM feature.
It's all crazy!
Presently renewed accounts of students who read in normal middle school as a classmate
MEB, after 4+4+4, the first schools in Turkey were converted as the first school, the middle, and the graduation.
After the first year of education, the renewed "insteadfast" pointed out that a lot of school-school graduation was signed with a new skanda during transition processes.
In Turkey that year came to me during the transition in the New Testament of Congratulation in the Mediterranean Cyclopedia.
The normal year is a year.
Shecheer's first graduation school, the 4+4+4 was turned into a middle-day.
In school, the first school and four classes were trained together to move to another system to another school, and the middle school was 6,7 and 8.
For a 1,000 years, the normal graduation school was converted to the celebration of 2012 to the end of the 2012-2013 training training year.
The school that was transmitted to climbing the first year was the first time in the school of five classes.
But last year, the class of the 5th class was automatically renewed from the electronic class of students who were going to graduate to the normal graduation and to the sixth class of this year.
"The other school I don't want."
The rabbis, who learned the situation, came to school and complained about the situation.
But the school administrator of the national education manager said to his executives, "The men who don't want their children to continue in the capital. They can take the story to another medicine."
In the explaining of the International Education of Council, it's interesting.
In an explanation, we changed some schools with the colleagues of the Education and the University of Education.
The schools enter the e-read system with school codes.
But when the school is turned into lines, the code of the old school is removed from the system.
The new school code and the system needs to be registered by students.
These schools used the schools and different school students, as well as their teachers, to use a new revolution code to send them to the middle.
They can take their children's schools and take them to other schools."
