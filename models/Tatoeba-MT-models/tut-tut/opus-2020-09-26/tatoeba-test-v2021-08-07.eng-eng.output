It's a lucky house.
America's suffering to lose our young men and women.
It's a cat.
It's a thrilling city, New York.
It's a pity you can't go with us.
It's a pity you can't join us.
It's a privilege to meet you.
It's better to take your time quickly and make mistakes.
It's obvious that she's home.
It's Monday.
It's getting bigger.
It's getting dark out there.
It's getting dark outside.
It's good you don't have to study so hard.
It's amazing.
It's never late to learn.
It's not always easy to distinguish right from wrong.
It's not a watch.
It's not easy to speak English.
It's not especially hot today.
It's not raining.
It's not until you're sick to see the value of health.
It's not until you lose your health.
It's not a bug.
It's not always easy to face the reality.
It's not as hard as it sounds.
It's not clear who wrote this letter.
It's not easy, but we'll do that anyway.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.

It's not far away from the hotel.
It's not for the starters.
It's not gonna hurt.
It's not good to scoff people in public.
It's not heavy.
It's not just my problem.
It's probably not sure Tom will admit that he's wrong.
It's not like Tom's going anywhere.
It's not fun to do that.
I don't need to do that.
Tom doesn't need to do that by himself.
We don't need to go to this lecture.
We don't need to make a decision now.
It doesn't need you to be here any longer.
It's not possible to change the past.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
It's not rational.
It's not really important.

It's not something I can miss.
It's not Tom's idea, it's mine.
It's probably not so sure Tom's gonna want to do that.
It's not working.
It's not working yet.
It's not worth resting this camera.
It's not worth it.
It's said he knows the secret.
It's still moving.
It's Sunday.
It's amazing that they should have a second house in America.
It's time for you to go to bed.
It's too late for him.
It's too late for you.
It's true that I am a steady teacher.
It's true that the earth is around.
It's very kind of you to show me the way.
It's very useful.
It'll be hard to find out what caused the problem.
It'll be done by the time you get here.
Tom's gonna be hard to do that.
It'll be hard to win Tom.
It'll be impossible to do that.
It won't take less than one hour to go there.
It looks like it's going to rain.
It looks like Tom and Mary want to do that.
It looks like someone has put a page out of this book.
It looks like Tom is waiting for someone.
That makes sense.
It's not hard to do this as you think it's going to be.
It might be good to do that.
It's not hard to do as you think it's going to be.
It's not too hard to do this.

I tried to do all I could to stop Tom.
I tried to kill myself twice.
I tried to convince Tom to come to Australia with us, but he said he had other things to do.
I trusted someone who didn't deserve my trust.
It's 2:30.
It's a bargain.
It's a beautiful day!
It's about time you got here!
It's a complete disaster.
It's a dead poison!
It's a good thing to do Tom.
It's a good thing, Tom left the door open.
It's gonna be all right.
It's always a person's birthday.
It's a miracle!
It's a miracle that our house survived the earth.
It's a miracle that Tom survived the accident.
It's a miracle, Tom survived that tragedy.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had a chance.
It's a secret, please don't tell anyone.
It's a shame you can't go with us.
It's hard for me to walk so far.
It's been years since we met the last time.
It was a while since I told you I love you.
It's decided.
It's done before.
It's beyond me.
It's hard to love someone when it's not clear to you or not the other person loves you in the same way.
It's hard to love someone when it's not clear to you or not the other person loves you in the same way.
It's hard to love someone when it's not clear to you or not the other person loves you in the same way.

It seems he'll have to work hard.
It seems like Tom and Mary are classical music.
It seems Tom wants to be a teacher.
Looks like you're not having a good time here.
It looks like nobody's home.
It seems there's no one in there.
Looks like I've seen the man on the side where he's dressed somewhere.
It's enough to drive you mad!
It's gonna be hard to do it.
It's gonna be hard to find someone else to replace Tom.
It'll be easy to find someone to rent this house.
It'll be hard to do this now.
It's gonna be hard to find someone else to replace Tom.
It's good Tom didn't do that yet.
It's hard to believe that Tom is only ten years old.
It's hard to catch a rape with your bar hands.
It's hard to do this, isn't it?
It's hot.
It should have been easy to do.
It's important to do this right.
It's impossible to do that.
It's just twenty ago.
It's amazing.

It's not hard to guess what's going on.
It's not good to eat and run.
It's not healthy for eating.
It's not how much you know, but what you can do.
It's not just a small problem.
It's not just Tom's fault.
It's not just Tom's problem.
It's not like I don't want to do it.
It's not like that.
It's not like I was trying to avoid Tom.
It's probably not sure Tom will admit it's wrong.
It's probably not sure Tom will admit that he's wrong.
It's not easy as you think it's going to be.
It's not likely to rain tomorrow.
It's not like we're doing anything.

It's not too expensive.
It's not too hard.
It's not too late to call Tom.

It's not what you say, but how you say it.
It's not worth mentioning.
It's not worth it.
It's not worth the effort.

It's not you, it's me!
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.

It's obvious, Tom's angry.
It's obvious that Tom wasn't used to live on a twin budget.
It's obvious, Tom is waiting for someone.

It's raining cats and dogs.
It's raining, it's lovely for weeks lasting.
It's really hot!
It's not really important.
It's not really important.
Tom and Mary were disappeared.
It's amazing that you didn't hear anything from Tom.

That's what Tom would do.
It's time to think about your past.
It's time to wash that funny, Tom.
It's Tom Mary wants to see.
It's Tom Mary wants to talk to her.
It's Tom's birthday tomorrow.
It's so bad you didn't take my advice.
It's completely dark outside.
It's a sad thing that happened.
It's unlike Tom, it's gonna do that.
It's unlike Tom, it's gonna do that.
It's unnecessary.
It's usually easy for Norwegians to get what Swedes say.

It's the way Tom promised to be here.
That was what Tom wanted.
It's your fault.
It took longer than I expected.
I turned off my computer.
I turned the lights off.

It'll be easier later.
It won't stay like that.
It won't stay this way.
It will destroy us all.
It would be easier for the people if they were to be afflicted by the Criterion of the people.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to the taxi station.
It's not hard for us to do this.
It won't be so hard to do that.
It would be fun.

It would have been hard to do this.
It would be interesting to do that.
It would be romantic to do that.
It would have been tired to do that.

I already told Tom I don't want to do that.
I already told Tom I should do that.

I was told that you're a very good French speaker.
I was told that you're looking for a baby.

I never met anyone like you before.
