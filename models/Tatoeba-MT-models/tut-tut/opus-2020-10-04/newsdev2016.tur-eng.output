Norveç's rakfisk: Is this the most beautiful fish in the world?
Norwegian's five million people enjoy the highest life standards, not only in Europe, but in the world.
Can the secret of the country's success be related to the local workmate, some of the flagrant fish?
Take a time of past cheese.
Put them in the middle of a flub for a flub.
Leave a week.
Now you have a great Norwegian tattoo, a rakfisk smell.
I'm in the little Fagernes city, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, great manzara, and this smell is always on the air.
Rakfisk is a wave of cool fish that you love for a year.
When the darkness and the air is cold, Norwegians are gathered here for this most famous festival.
In the full-time mission of the Festivalal Department, "Raakfisk Generali" and "Airard Halvarsen" says, "You'll eat this, then you'll have a bardak aquait."
People around us eat little fish and drink a lot of drinks.
Airard says, "Some people like aquavitite more than rakfisk."
He could kill the bottle.
I call a few pieces.
If you can avoid taking off the bus, it's not bad, it's quite different from a sushi language after a long bus trip.
Before Rakfisk Norveç's buzzz, it's a very different kind of famine of water in the east of the fish.
Then, when they are supplicated in the depths of the winter, they will be driven out, and they will surely be overcome by the inner sense.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegian people were forced to leave their country, and they moved to the United States.
Now the people are expansing fast - more than 13 percent of work, higher payments, and widespread care systems.
The former rakip and the people from Sweden, who is more rich than Norwegian, are going to work.
Rakfisk represents something important, but it's a part of the life of Norveç's past.
It's among the most valuable food you can buy.
But everything's worth, you'll give a little $9 $14.
Norwegian doesn't often come to the global news, and most people like that.
The people here are still unwilling to talk about the name of Anders Breivic, 77 men, women and children with weapons.
Instead, it's called "22 July" to kill.
Norwegians are hard to believe that one of them can do such a kind of murder and murder in the peaceful lands.
Since Norveç's today's wealth has been grown from the early 1970 ’ s, one of the biggest and nuclears of the world.
Our grass is Anna Nordik's famous hair hair, and the time of the blue blue, when she says, "It's not the only reason we're doing so well."
How do we say we are a humble people?
In English, like most people here, perfect.
We're not a lot of shower, we don't like the champion.
Norwegian was overseeing the wealth of the Norwegian, but only a small percent of the money from industries, is distributed to a special purse for the future generation.
While the other people cheated the money they didn't have, the years of the world's financial crization, they wore the coins of the Norwegian capital.
Anna says, "We're happy if we can make the winter snow and the mountains walk."
And she adds, "Oh, as long as it's racfisc."
I'm standing on the card, and I'm waiting for something to eat. I'm eating enough rakfisc.
Now, there's a handbock hamburger, of course, something different and more pleasant.
But there's more than that smell fish night.
One of the hotels that I'm staying on the rakfisc dinner, the guests are the best in here, and maybe they're giving the fire to the most difficult fish.
There's a live television connection on a paponent server.
It's like the Eurovision song runs.
"How much do you have for the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Our princes here, Havard."
Wait, they've got coffee.
A man falls from his chair, maybe under the influence of aquavit.
Or maybe the smell of all the fish.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto's starting hard.
As the new president of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Will Grant looks on the challenges and expects from BBC and his people.
Mexican's traffic is so bad now.
While there was a riot in the best time, he was exposed to a crazy people who had broken all the main routes from the capital day of Saturday.
But the purpose was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching the university.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto will take the lead of the nation.
He's dealing with a hard task.
The government of Felipe Calderon was a good economic performance, but the country was under control of a 600,000 drug war that led to death in six years.
Mr. Pena Nieto said to the U.S. President Barack Obama to the United States this week, "I have a big word to the Mexican people to reduce the violence of my government."
I'm going to offer a new security strategy that makes us reach.
Before Mr. Pena Nieto and the former political experience of Mr. Pena Nieto was governed in his country in Mexico.
The crowd around the capital is divided by the idea of the new leader in this old country.
He's a man with a clear word.
For example, in the village Valle del Bravo, a loving memory.
Those who live here are honored that he's performing the tunnel in the tacid place and who made the lips.
You can go through Mr. Pena Nieto's new roads to get to the city, and I'm a big growing up on the traffic roads that have been changed.
And the plakets that have been called are also the foundation outside the modern sports center and the impressive climate change museum.
"We're looking at it to make a permanent change," says Mr. Pena Nieto's friend and political colleague, Gabriele Olvera Hennandez.
Especially we look forward to a very interesting and real change in our country for security and economic.
After 81 years of independent power, PRI was released by Vicentte Fox in 2000.
Olvera, a district attendant, admits that she had a lot of hope for in the party after 12 years outside the President of Los Pinos, in the party, Enrique Pena Nieto.
And he refuses the new president's independence.
A man who's openly called himself with a great country visa.
It's a great government man, and a man who knows to listen more than all of them.
But that's not the idea that many people have the old rulers on the other part of the state.
Ciudad Naza, known as Nezaalcoyotl, couldn't have been more struggling against Valle del Bravo's parked streets.
In many ways, a banlet of Mexico City under the Otowen college.
And the problems in the capital are too difficult and city.
It's been called to help the drugs in the army in the communities of this year, and violence against women is particularly much more.
A empty area near a large bunch of corpse was thrown into the body of the woman just in the past two years.
By the time Mr. Pena Nieto was governed, more than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico, which is more than the Cyududud Juarze, known as the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Pena Nieto said she couldn't look enough for her murder.
The worst of all, they are accused of disregarding his rule.
She's trying to fight with her tears when she showed me the pictures of Marina Luna's girl.
According to the official version of events, Marina was killed in 2010.
But his family believes that he was killed by his partner.
“ When I went home, ” recalls Senora Buendia.
There's a trauma that shows that he was suspicious, and death's gravity already started.
When her mother repeated the story, she looks down on Marina's picture from a wall, with one word on it: Justice.
But he said that this family was completely disowned.
The government officials treated me as an old slanderer, an issuer, an advertiser.
What they want is to accept people's words simplely and shut their knifes off.
"But it's not true when there's so much disorder and fraud.
President Pena Nieto comes with heavy responsibilities on Saturday.
Over the past six years, the ten thousand families were impressed by the terrible crimes in Mexico, and they promised them to take priority in the new president.
Olvera, a member of the PRI Congregation, says in Valle del Bravo, "I hope he's a president."
But this is the most dreadful of the victims in Ciudad Naza.
Bradley Manning claims that Bradley didn't complain about doing evil.
Scanners try to oppose Bradley Manning's misuse.
Consumption focuses on the time Manning Quantico was in prison in Virginia.
He wants the case to be closed because Manning's imprisonment is hard to be imprisoned.
Snapshot all thousands of secret documents in the army
The Saturday of Saturday, the army in the U.S. was accused of the greatest secret marital strife in the United States.
F. F. Meade Maryland was a celizade prosecutor, Maj. When Ashden Fein Manning's industration, Quantico showed that when he was holding nine months in Virginia, he was not indicating that his colleagues did not show the wrong way of visiting the weekly visits.
One day after the Celsius's imprisonment was hardly punished and enough to end Manning's case in the case of Manning.
The army arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents when he was assigned to the capital analysis in Irak.
The Material later published by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning's information source.
In Saturday, Fein studied with Maning the forms of the maning, which were imprisoned in Qantico, which was expanded from June 2010 to April 2011, when he was imprisoned to the military prison with Manning.
The chiefs asked Manning and noted their answers.
When Fein asked me about forms on Saturday, Man’s prisoners said that the actions of Man's jail were "kemmel" and that all the actions of the system were "a lot of professionals."
Forms don't make a complaint, but the officers say that they're asking Manning about what they're doing.
He told Man about the things he was worried about, and the attendants spoke about their concerns and said that they would return to them, but they did not have the answer.
Man's said, "What you've written isn't going to say, and it doesn't mean it doesn't say anything."
Court jerbay Denise Lind de Manning asked why he didn't murmur about the injured ideas that he had discussed during the 2011 January 2011 meeting.
Man's objection at the meeting was to be brought down the "foreseen" condition.
The army told him that one step of his independence was to protect him and others.
"I asked something to know I was good, and I wanted to get out of the POI situation... to make a taste of a life that has increased from my view."
Manning was arrested in Irak on Thursday in June 2010 and reported that Marine Base Quantico was transferred to Kuveyt, nearly two months before he was transferred to the military prison in Virginia in Virginia.
He said he thought he was in Kuveyt, and he loved it once because he was hot.
He told him that he would not let him know what happened and what happened in the external world.
"My world's cafe, Camp Arafjon" said Manning's Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cafe.
When Man went to Quantico, most of his days, at least 21 hours, and 23 hours, most of them were lonely in a little cell.
Man's only said he was given a bed, a bed, a blanket, a mirror, a little dress and eyes.
He said that he was trying to move because he was sleeping in the day, and he said that it was not the rules.
Man's always sleeping with light from the outside of the cell.
When he returned, the prisoners told him that if he did not see his face, they would awaken him and return him.
In January 2011 Manning's lawyer was introduced to Manning.
In April 2011, Man's man moved to a military prison in Kansas.
On Saturday, the judge asked Man Manning that he was trying to sleep on a night in Qantico, and he asked him if he was hard to stand before the prisoners and other officials.
In the number, man said that he had no chance to cover himself with the battery.
When the judge questioned on Saturday, Manning said he had to throw a battane on the command of the prisoner, but nobody had ordered to shoot him.
Manning said he was trying to wake up the night of the Saturday because he had an opportunity to show that he wasn't dangerous for himself.
The man's officer said he could only hurt himself by using a chemical cheese or a mirror of fingers, but he didn't do it.
Man's reported that the inner wraps were taken from their fingers and eyes.
The judicials hope that at least at least the court will take care of his experiences in prison, and he's going to reduce his sentence in the case of a military court that was to be executed at the start of the next year.
He said that Manning would admit his sin in smaller crimes, and he planned to fight over the excessive crimes.
The meeting was planned to continue in the end of this week, and it's expected to argue about the issue that the prosecutor's condition is confirmed.
Pentagon Manning said that all the largest contracts in Quantico were in accordance with the rules of Quantico.
Those who are involved with Manning, helping the enemy, independent procedures on the Internet, reporting national security information, and thieves or records.
If he judges all of my episodes, he's going to be in prison.
Mexican American Identity Required
Many people say that because of the lack of opportunity here, they're forced to leave Mexico.
Mexicans say they're in a criticism, remembering the Mexican times of difficult times.
Navarrette says the Mexican Americans are struggling between two worlds.
In a nearby trip to Mexico City, I came to a group of people to the move, and I was surprised.
The signs were shown in two sorts: one for Mexicanos ("Mexicans"), and the other for the "Extranjeros" for the "Enthranjeros"
I stood there for a few seconds, I wasn't sure where I was going.
Because I grew up in the center of California, I was called "Mexican" all my life.
In this ethnic stenoe, my friends in Boston call "Arlandal" or my friends in New York say "Italian."
I decided later in the Mexican America.
But it was Mexico.
And my grandfather didn't need a stenoa or a hole in the country.
I was a simple American.
I'm speaking Spanish, I'm good enough to control the two sides of a conversation in this language.
But I don't have local words, and I can't get rid of my American agent.
That's why I got my U.S.A., and I went to the order for Enjeros.
When the Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto President Obama this week, I thought it was the white Saray.
It's always the same as when you meet two countries every day: move, drugs, and business.
Pena Nieto was eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy until the Mexicans were trying to enter the United States now.
The United States and Canadians want to make a traffic block in the European University in North America.
Pena Nieto doesn't make clear, but he swore that Mexico would continue fighting with drug cards.
The relationship with the United States is complicated with complex and negative feelings for Mexico.
Most Americans may have thought that the United States was invaluable in 1848 and was forced to force their leaders to give them half of their land.
But it's not just a minute, but the mexicans who think about some of the centuries are all over everywhere.
So when an American government says a little criticism about Mexico, you begin to hear a complaining about the Americans who oppressed the neighborhood of the neighbors.
And Montezuma's children go to war.
And yet, the real challenge for Mexico is with more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about bad feelings?
There's so much.
In Mexico, the winners and the lost ones are the people who have the opportunity to make the country and the people who haven't created.
The only reason that many people from Mexican is to live in towns like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, and San Antonio, maybe one of our grandfathers or grandparents would have to stay in Mexico and go norther.
And mostly this guy follows a profile -- a big ten, little training, a poor village.
We are their offspring, and We are their ancestors.
Not Mexico.
And we're not living in the United States, but we can never forget the fact that we've gone to good schools and found good things, not Mexico, but the American Water.
Sometimes our identity may be incomplete, but our loyalty is obvious.
It's in the United States.
Also, we know that most Mexicans in the administrator class don't like us.
That's the feeling.
They view us as a reminder of a degrading victory, and they look up above us as we haven't been a small group of Mexicans.
Our Spanish is never good enough, and our relationship with Mexico isn't enough.
Our existence is completely failure in their eyes.
If our families weren't failure in Mexico, they wouldn't go.
And now we couldn't find ourselves closed behind the shield, but it's well living in the United States, but they're still missing spirits.
My wife, who was born in Guadalahara, came to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that the Mexicans were more harder than they were, and that the Mexican Americans were involved in this.
Although he is a citizen of the United States, he views himself as part of two countries.
And they don't feel like the two Mexican Americans I know.
We like to listen to the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte and Bruce Springsteen.
You're taking the best of the two worlds, but you're not a root.
We look like America in Mexico.
We are recognised as Mexican in the United States.
Just as I've trained some Mexican leaders and some lights, like I've learned to interrupt my relationship, so they want to reconnect with Diaspora.
The Mexican Americans want to run as temporary Mexicans to show their interest in the United States.
We're going to tell the Americans how beautiful it's to visit the Americans, and we're forced to strengthen their relationship with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't happen.
There's a lot of negative feelings.
And we're not sure that this is a wonderful country by equality, and the widespread corruption and the violence of drug abuse.
I'm afraid you're alone, friends.
That's right.
At least some Mexicans have not yet been ready to forgive because of their behavior to Mexico almost half years ago, and then some Mexican Americans still have to admit that they have to be angry about the actions of their family.
Hmmm.
Maybe I thought, "We're a mechanical."
Old Wars, New Middle East
The fire between Israel and Hamas could be a foundation of peace.
Can Arabs and the Jews always be peaceful in the Middle East?
Another blood bloody means that this hope is empty.
There were many unfortunate disputes between who had started, and more than 140 Philistines and six Israelites were killed, and the physicians from the great city of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem were first to the close of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
But the Israelites and Philistines seemed to be stunned in their old conflict, but the Western West change.
The Arabs lifted the curves into the air, and you don't like it, and the Philistines and the Israelites were in a volcano.
Maybe it makes their struggle more bloody than before.
But there's a reason for reason to think that this could destroy their killing.
It's no winning war.
It looks like it's hard to justify the health.
While the fires received on November 21, this week's war has strengthened the throats on both sides.
Since 2007, the Muslim movement of Gazza, the leaders of Hamas, who were defeated by Gazze, will claim that the Israelites were forced to turn back.
He couldn't destroy Israel Hamas, even though they killed some of his leaders and hold 1,7 million people in one of the worst and largest population of the world.
Of course, the other part of Hamas Philistine's capitals in Fathom is the central philosophy in Western Shiria.
More than that, the leaders of Hamas could dismiss the conclusion that the time was with them.
As the Muslims in Arabic world gained power, Hamas became strong and rich friends.
The nearest renewed renewed region of Israel's former Muslim medicine has taken the purpose of Turkey Hamas, one of the most rich and most dynamic of Körfez.
The people of Hamas are saying that a Muslim license was hurled to the Syria, which led a competition of the Israelite army from Lybullah army to the northern Syria, who threatened the king of Gamas, who threatened the king of Gizbullah.
Besides all, he changed the balance of the highest and important region of the Roman brothers in Egypt in the southern Arab regions of Israel.
Until the fall in 2011, there was a little time for Hamas's junior, who was governing Egypt for 30 years.
On the contrary, Brother Hamas's cousin and leaders are more subjects on the ball.
The next diplomama can be identified as a actor, even Israel and America.
In this time, the guards of Israel will be the opposite results.
As a soldier, he was put back to the Hamas box.
Israel's Demir Cube's anti-sube system proves the value of the floor, and most of Hamas's pockets were destroyed.
The Israelites will be better sleeping for a while.
According to Diplomatic, the American is as determined as never before, and most European countries accuse Hamas of starting the last violence.
Besides all of them, Israel grew up under the head of Binyamin Netanyahu, who did not pay attention to the Peace process.
While the rokets from Gazze have been killed from 2004, Israel was able to save a little from the defenses of the capital of the eastern Philistine, who had been inflicted in the capital of the eastern city, and who continued to expand their lands despite the national revolution.
The Licud party is comfortable with Mr. Netanyahu, who is going to make a decision on January 22 January, with the Avigdor Lieberman's more than the war team.
Why are you happy to give these false Philistines their governments?
If they really manage West Syria, will they not fire like their neighbors in Gazza?
It's better to hold them behind the wall and punish them when they're taking their heads.
Maybe the preservators won, but Arab can change their account.
The Muslims have gained power in Egypt and the other lands are very little to love Israel, but the first priority is to deal with the challenges of their home.
Israel's defense is bigger than the Arab neighbors.
Fighting with local power doesn't help new Arab governments to reform the economics of the new Arab governments.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked along with Barack Obama to bring a well - looking fire. They may be able to start something.
The Israelites should look for a long time.
When the rest of the Arab world became more democracy, the physicians form a bus, like a bus that ran in Tel Aviv, in the country of Israel.
The pressure in the Jewish state has already thumbnailed the democracy, and the Arab people's growing up are burning demography.
In a few years, there's a diplomatic price that can take to scale Hamas in a few years.
He needs encouragement from both sides.
Most of the two sides are announced to the external world and this newspaper: two governments that represent Israel’s security.
In short time, a little hope can stir up, that's the purpose that the foreigners who are compelling to pressure.
Now, there's a better place to convince Egypt, Turkey, and Katar, the Jewish State, which is to stop the gun, to convince Hamas of the land, which is based on the limits of 1967.
The foreign Arabs should force Hamas and Fathom to merge Hamas and Fathom.
It's more useful than the climate policy of a Philistine government in the BM.
Mr. Obama is playing the role of bringing Israel to the table.
In the first century, he neglected to offer his own peace plan.
He looks like he's unwilling to get in the white Saray.
He doesn't see the future in a painful way.
America has an important expense in the Middle East.
This means a peacemaker between Israel and Philistines.
Sigara's simple packets in Australia.
Smoking warnings and patient organs are put into simple green boxes for all the hot cigarettes
In the world, the first laws of Australia about tobacco and tobacco in the world have gone to the market logos and colors, and the local olive tree covers, the dry pictures of sick organs, and the babies of their parents.
The only difference between health warnings and visions is to print the same market names that will be compatible since Saturday.
It's the hardest registration in this world to get a cigarette.
Australia's federal government says that your goal is to stop young people from smoking from the habit of smoking.
This is based on research, which indicates that people will not start smoking until they are 26 years old.
"You can see that even since you've been very young, kids are trying to sell the markets of the markets."
There is one of the lowest smoking habits in the world of Australia, and the changes can be a little affecting the wombs of many nations, but other countries have similar steps.
The tithe's industries made a strong lobby against law.
He said he would support his traffic trade, and they would be more expensive and more cigarettes.
British Tobacco in Australia, Scott McIntyre said, "It's going to be very serious.
China and Indonesia will bring more fruit to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say the law has increased.
Zico, a small family colleague of Pty Ltd, was almost almost almost almost curved in the British Tobacco, Imperial Tobaco, Philip Emperor Morris and Japan Tobacco, when he lost his high courts in Sandra Latd, he was exposed to high courts.
He says Zico was selling over 6,000 selling lands, and he was waiting for a new skirt.
It's a good job for us.
The scientists say that the demographic media is the population of the policy that the policy plans for the policy of the policy.
Some Australian law banned television registration and sports, and after asked that many of the seller's smoking smokings should be hidden from the visible places.
The Australians banned the Internet registers and sites, but the sea can't limit the excessive sites.
Becky Freeman, a people at the University of Sydney University, said, "Becky Freeman only is this small window if you're in the holiday and you have your products.
Freeman's markets say they're growing in social media, such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook.
We need to ask this Marlboro, a human citizen who really likes to smoking the cigarettes and videos, or is it in this?
British American Tobacco said she was focused on completing new rules than on the market in Australia.
The Edustrie's investigated to curve new rules in the Gonduras and the Dominican Republic, and these countries claim that the trade was unfairly restricted, even though it wasn't for anyone in the World Ticaret Organization.
A WTO decision was to be left in the middle of 2013.
Plibert said that the government has interviewed other countries that think of similar packages.
In 2001, it was the first country in Cana.
Now these are scattered to over 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey, and Ukraine.
In England, New Zealand, South Africa, and India, there are more difficult laws.
Most people in Australia are smoking.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm overlooking them.
When you buy a packet with a telephoned photo, Victor El Hage said, "Take a cigarette and put it in."
If you're true, there's only one reason to leave, and she's my little girl.
James Yu, who worked the King of the Packet in the center of Sydney, said, was trying to traffic the traffic traffic.
Yu said, "It would have taken one hour before, and now it's my four hours."
He said, "The government should have been banned all the time, OK, that's all right, we'd say we'll shut up the store."
It's not bad in a world that is constantly competent
I spent five hours in the airplane when our airplane was undergoing mechanical problems, and when we had to wait for another plane, I've spent five hours waiting on the airport.
So I've had a lot of time to think about frustration.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
I don't even tell you about nuclear trades, such as books, books, magazines, iPhones.
But some academics and children are praised by experts.
They say sometimes it's normal for us and our children.
He forces his brain to go to the interesting tangents and maybe it increases creativity.
And most of us do not experience the benefits of flying because we're connected to another screen.
So we need to open a hungry hot?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll be back to this.
First of all, I thought it was a new idea that it's like a lot of people to have more free time.
In Calgary University in Canada, the Greek and Roman historical professor of Greece, and the author Peter Toohey says that it isn't like that.
He said, "That's really a long date."
There's a Latin wall written on pompei's walls from the first century.
Then we're going to explain how to fly.
The problem is that it was defined in many different ways and disputed by John D. Eastwood, who was psychology at Ontario University in Canada.
After looking at the research literat literate and put the idea into a 100-period group, Professor Eastwood and colleagues describes it as a "do not get involved but do not get involved."
The thing that prevents suffering from ice cream, said, "Nobody wants to be busy but wants to be busy.
He said, there's nothing to do in a foreign country.
The geographic experience of the depression said, "It's a curiosity mode and an interesting process with the sense of time slow.
Stress can be like a lot of depression.
But Professor Eastwood may have been involved, but people who are frustrating about the problem are in the environment or the world, but people in depression view their problem as themselves.
Sometimes we think we're tired when we're trying to be consent.
Professor Eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an ancient test of a man who read a magazine in the magazines of “Don’t Define the Sustenance. ”
Some groups heard a voiceless television program in the side of the room, and others heard it as very little as little as they could, but the third group never heard.
Those who heard a low-level television reported more frequently than two other groups, and they had a hard time in concentration, but they didn't know why it was.
One of the work writers and the Gelph University in Ontario, Mark J. Fenske, said that when you try to focus on a difficult or busy task, your interest can be disturbed.
On the other hand, when you read something that hurts you, "It can help you to look at a fabric band, like the music that distracts your attention."
In fact, the depiction and the defense often appears to be a sign of distress can make people more fluctuate.
Professor Fenske said, "The kids who were allowed to move on are more likely to learn more than the kids who have been forced to move. They've received more information."
We're all experiencing trouble in some parts, the slowing of my flight, a monoon speaker, a frustrating movie.
But some people's in the desire to be more flattered than others.
In 1980, researchers developed a "Scatter Educational Story" in order to help calculate this.
"Many things I have to do" and "I have a lot of interesting areas, I don't have time to do anything."
In West Florida University, psychology professor Stephen Vodanovich, said that scientists, using such scientists, found that men have the desire to be more and more frequently to need more external experiment.
But it's often a small group of teenagers.
In 1991, the Illinois University, the professor Reed Larson interviewed with about 400-year-olds and parents every day.
The 32 percent of the Ergenes found that they were exhausted when they were not at school.
On the other hand, they said 3% of their parents were tired.
Professor Larson now said that the fifth percent of them wouldn't be less higher than 21 years later.
But the kids and kids haven't been controlled over what they want to do, so they know that "there's a period of frequency."
That's why I'm back to my first question, is it better for a human?
Sometimes no, because research indicates that when it's too absorbed, people can enter into physical dangers, gambling, or the use of material.
On the other hand, Professor Vodanovich, who has been working over two decades, said that many philosophers and writers are discussing the connection between creativity and creation.
Gary Marcus, a psychological professor in N.Y.U. said, "It's a way to tell you that your brain must do something else."
But the brain doesn't always know the best thing to do.
If you're struggling and use this energy to play guitar and eat, you'll be happy.
But if you're watching television, that can make you happy in a short time, but it doesn't happen long.
So if you give her a iPad, you can't be bored anymore, but Professor Fenske said, "I don't know to be fun or do it."
And he said, "It's going to be transferred to another situation."
Your kid doesn't just learn to be fun, but he's more controlled in other areas.
I don't think we really want to be happy.
We shouldn't be so critical.
On the contrary, our goal should be to be free from being free from curiosity before continually playing the occult and technology.
Professor Eastwood started.
He said, "We need to fly it more often, but frequently, it's the desire to be related to something hurtful and disturbing."
He said, "It is a way that the people are really looking for, and that is a way to get out of the luxury."
He said, "It's hard to find ways to be busy in a environment where we are threatened.
No Senary for New Marihuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orosco, a district university in South Colorado, 19 is charged for something that will be legally legal in the country.
In September, Mr. Orosco said that he and his friends were stopped in Lamar, while they were driving a car near the Cansas border.
When the police officer found the marihuana in the car, Mr. Orosco each of them received a call for small crimes, transportation and drugs.
He said, "It's made us guilty." Mr. Orosco.
But is that someone?
The answer of Colorado's proposal to use a small amount of marijuana's independence on a small number of weeks, dependent on the answer of hundreds of small drug cases of the law.
Hundreds of acute marihuana's case is already closed in the Washington state of Washington, confirming a similar rule.
When the police units are 21 years old and up to adults in the weeks, the law has left the charge to carry a small scale that will be approved.
But the prosecutors in Colorado in more substituted areas have sworn to keep all the marihuana issues and still invite people to the court for moving.
Also, they use a vote to prevent the licenses of the new lisans in the licenses from Denver to the West Mountains.
Denver's police officer, Daniel J. Oates, said, "It grows so fast, and I don't know what happens next."
The editors in the Washington State are shifting their heads.
And in December 1, 2013, they're looking for guidance to build a license system for producing, imagination, distribution, and selling.
Colorado's first use of medicine at first, and now they're saying he's in most of the country's possibility about the medicine.
The Wahington Health Committee speaker Brian E. Smith said, "There's a more regular phase, so they will be a good guide."
But no place or system has continued to do more than tell us what's going on. Mr. Smith.
He said, "There's no real example to do."
The law called Washington's I-502 will be acting in December 6 December, and the country licens system has not yet existed, but it will leave a year where a legal movement will be to be independent.
There are hard mechanical questions to be resolved during this period, like the restrictions of schools, parks, child parks, or child-cleaning licenses on 1000 feet away from the state.
The new investigation group Ben Livingston said, “Nowhere can be more difficult to find licenses in anywhere than the city, especially the great city of Seattle. ”
On November 21, the Chief Office of Aurora sent an e - mail to the officers of the Aurora, who would not have the lawyer's "how to enter into the course of action" and nobody will be investigated for the small marijuana policy and that the police will let people stop the crimes.
The Chief Oates said that the police would put the city laws and will follow their drug dealers and sellers.
The North Colorado's Western district officer Ken Buck represents a more steady view.
After taking action, his office said he would continue to watch the marijuana cases, as a way to force the users to heal.
Today, when 119 people are charged with two tens or less, many of them face other charges.
Mr. Buck said, "It's a requirement to succumb to crimes when our office's happened."
Even in lands where the votes rejected the marihuana entrance, like the village of Mesa, are hard to answer.
The police in Grand Junction in the largest city of the region are not the case for the adults.
Pete Hautzinger, the district officer of the district, supported this decision, but he decided not to shut down the transport cases that were waiting for.
He said, "I don't think I'm cheating my time with the law until I continue to do it."
It wouldn't have been easy to put in the government and legal system to the vote 55 percent of the voyages in Colorado, but it wouldn't be easy to take the funeral marijuana into the government and legal system.
And the dissension in the state of the country brings a deep conflict between the local governments about the big green control of the country.
The local speaker of the Denveran lawyer and Marihuana lawyer says that this is a "scalely barrier" with the officials of the National Organization of Mariuana.
He said, "They've spent more of their lives in suspecting people, so they still don't accept that it is legal."
In a small amount of marijuanaa, they are ready to be international tests of medicine in order to make use of drugs, such as Colorado and Washington.
The lawyers and governments are waiting for a new set of restrictions for legal sales, and they are also expecting a federal government that plans to sell marijuana and to approach their production as a federal crime.
The lawyers of Marihuana hope the Registration of Justice.
Despite the medical marijuana's patients and sellers, the physician has often allowed the federal government in Colorado, Washington, and in the 16 countries.
The former drug politician, Kevin A. Sabe, said, wouldn't have the doors to catch the drugs, but they wouldn't allow them to make funerals in the country where the new law was given.
Some towns in Colorado don't expect the federal governments to move.
Even before the decision day, some local governments agreed that the new marihuana stores, about a year, were to be repaid to open.
Montrose in the West last week gave a six - month ban, and the next week's recognition.
Bob Nicholson, a member of the city, said, "We don't want to get one of the licenses to take a big federal problem."
Our district used a game against change.
We're looking at the region playing against the country.
There's a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I'm pretended from Oxford because I'm precautional.
It's not only that the disciples today are attacked because of their opinions.
I don't remember when I didn't dream to get a place at Oxford University.
My father and my grandfather were in a place where the modern - day red wine of the world was the best education of the world, in Greece Sempoza, the two columns of the world were intrigued by thinking and encouraging to think and torrents.
But in two weeks when I got my place in Worcester College to read the history of sex, and I started my first skandal in my life.
Dad fell down and weeped.
Friends were surprised.
He said that I was separated from my licenses because I didn't have sex with my license in my room.
The author A N Wilson told me that I was leaving because I was forced to drink a broken finance.
It was a little funny.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran away because I was dealing with system selling and dreading.
It's not because I'm a little weird name or I'm coming from special school.
I was just judged for one reason, and in the fiveth of this word, it was a head and a barcade: Dad, my father, Woodrow Wyatt, Margaret Thatcher was a high-friend counselor, and I was supporting Muhafazaar.
You can ask why I got this.
According to recent reports, the new generation, the disciples of the right center of the new generation have the same judicial decisions.
In Oxford, there was so much advertising and the hatred that had grown so much that last week a group of homosexuals demanded the same equal rights with those who were oblivious, ethnic, and ethnic.
Corpus Christi College's third classroom (JCR) reported that the members of the politician members of Corpus Christi College said that they were lonely lonely because of their politics.
They want to create an equivalent publication in the college of college to be freed.
New BBC 2 documented Wonderland wasn't helped with the situation: The students showed the young, Park and the right reporters as strange and nao-Nazi.
Oxford University (OUCA) showed Joe Cooke and Rolls-Royce when he was walking with the former president of the Oxford University (OUCA).
In other university students say that they were treated as “the goats of sin ” for their expenses.
Luke Black, the University of Notingham University, said to a Monday President of Centuries, "It's a left-blood separation that grows up in emperors."
"The people think we're like Bullingdon Club before we meet us."
In the history of Corpus Christi, historian Roberts says that such a world doesn't exist, but Stephanie Cherill, 19 says the president of the OUCA's right-friend JCR, is a district for the right position of JCR members.
"This is an integral argument that threatens to atmosphere and to members."
I was just a few weeks in Oxford.
On September 18, 1986, I was ashamed.
It was the most fierce time to hate Parti.
The past year, because of their university colleagues, the old student Margaret Thatcher voteed a game to reject his honor.
This atmosphere scared a Stalin's side.
In the first few days of the first few weeks, I saw the joy of the pain that I was going to be with the students and teachers.
I've seen the teachers not only ignored the scoffing of their students but they made their interest.
The prosecutors of Madenci grevis have been taken to the South African politicians against the separating, and the government.
First of the 18th century, I was about to translate French texts into English, and I wasn't ready for those who came later.
Harry Pitt said, "I'm going to be Wyatt, please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled in this.
His face was a little man like the pool of Pitt.
"The Thatcher's people refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?"
The other license students were in the kitchen.
The tears hurt my eyes.
Pitt said, "In the free time, if you're not busy with social activities, I'll recommend you to get French principal lessons."
I went back to my room with a pain picture.
I sat at my college dinner that night, and then I felt a light touch in my head.
This was a second class named James, who identified himself as a member of the OUCA.
He said, "I know you're a boy."
I'm afraid that's it.
He's working with anyone who suspects that he is a preservator.
It's a bad thing for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most of the preservator's first classmate is acting like a workmate party.
Then, in a local bar, I tried to make a fearful tactics.
I suggested that I'm not going to participate all that Mrs. Bucher said.
This ticket proved failure.
One of the first class students who found in the Ironical Eton said, "You are the daughter of a fascist dollar."
You're kicked.
The other disciples were holding themselves.
I'm wrong, I was dirty.
Somebody asked, "How do you have sex?"
They're striking each other, aren't they?
I felt like the homosexuals felt before the liberal registered.
Would I ever have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been hard to meet people with the same idea when they were dark?
Would I have to go back to the colleague party?
Three years before me were exploited like a loneliness and loneliness.
The only public reporter in my university was the modern history Professor Norman Stone.
And the preservator and the Bucher was hated because he was one of the foreign political counselors and text writers.
He was just a little there.
He was small and stoned from there, and he hated Marksist because he was dependent on his history.
In 1997 Ankara began a professional in Turkey.
He said, "You won't be happy here."
I went to my parents from Oxford to the house in London, and I ran away with my friends and family.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
In the winters, all political views were accepted in his time.
He said, "But this is the best place in the world."
They don't do this, not among my dreams.
Even my communist friends were always perfect.
The nemli eyes started to be clouded.
Give me a chance.
I'm sure all this is a joke.
If you leave, my heart is broken.
I've tired my emotional stability from visits to London.
A devout man, my friend, obeyed the pressure and rejected his faith.
In one of the next weeks, another date teacher told me that I was really an enemy of the people. I decided to do the same.
I said, "My brain was washed up by my parents." And I said, "They're old fools."
It's short.
Oxford became Dad, who chewed my career for my career.
Then he was writing two streets each week in Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I'm in here, and five minutes later, those behind me gave up.
When they went, I prepared a ball and got your first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a shit.
But none of the 18-year-olds should be scared and frightened in a education institut.
He's a more tragedy of Oxford's 14 president, and he's in the back of the equivalent of an equivalent to this day.

You're seeing hundreds of news in social security and work areas.
I'm going to give you the most reliable, most healthy and reliable news in the red journals.com.com.
First, I want to take a lot of sounds on the ball.
We're going to discuss these writings in chapters that are going to continue in the lines.
In our writing, you can find answers to all the questions about money.
You can send your questions to alipa.comr.
I'll be very busy to answer you for a short time.
What's Mallin's investigation?
A MALLYN employer who lost 60 percent of his age and was unable to work at least 60 percent in order to kill the SSK and the United National Institute in the SGK law allows them to be able to redeem themselves before they know.
They are still able to rectify their jobs if they lose their ability to get their jobs apart from those above.
Who's counted for money?
I'm writing from the capital, my name is Mehmet Gulgin, I have 920 days, and I have a license on 540 days with my soldiers for 1460 days.
Besides, I'm a babies sick.
I'm connecting to the dialitarian machine.
I'm still working at a workplace.
Can I get the money month?
- Let's go first.
You didn't tell us when you were working for the first time in your problem.
But let's tell you how you're going to connect the capital month.
First of all, the conditions given in the Law have to be investigated for ten years, and 1800 days have to be your primary day.
Also, when the SGK's medicine is found that you have lost at least 60 percent of your work forces or your work accidents or business illness, you're not aware that you have lost at least 60 percent of your capital power in the work.
But you're here because you're a dialiased, you're giving 60 percent percent of a month, because you don't fill the number of 1800 prim days.
Of course we don't know how long you've been working.
The day you've finished 10 years and 1800 days together, you'll be connected by the SGK and use the day you're going to get out of your job.
The Challenges of Material Activity
Is it not possible for anyone who hasn't been retired for 10 years, 1800 days?
- 1800 days must be finished.
But there's only one property, and for those who decide to provide for another, they need to provide for the needs of others, and for those who are determined to provide for the needs of the other person's investigation, the report of the rest of the past ten years, without looking for other conditions for a period of independence.
It will be discussed in the following chapters of our letters about the need for those who need care.
Status of people before starting work
I'm Ahmet Gyeler.
I've been carrying all the circumstances in the SGK law, but they said, "You can't take the money for me before I first went to work.
I'm so violent.
Isn't it wrong?
How am I going to be retired?
Ahmet Bey, you've written all your circumstances in the Law, but it should not be the cause of the loss of the SSK and of the Uncleaking SSK in the law.
Because you don't have to move this condition, you can't connect it.
However, when you get older investigating, you may be able to work when you carry the funds.
- I have 3980 days, and I have 16 years of investigation.
The SGK was detected before I entered the job.
They said, "You can't be a competent.
I'll do what in this case.
I'm not gonna be cool.
Will you guide me?
- Yeah, you've heard it right.
You can't be able to do this.
But in the SGK law, there's a license for you.
Well, there's two conditions before and after October 2008.
If you start working the first time before this date, SGK knows that you're investigated before your work, you can take a half-related month in which you are at least 15 years of investigation and the number of 3600 princes of 3600 days.
So we're recommending you to have a monthly supplies by using a nearest SGK administrator.
Well, if you had been working after 2008, you could have been able to be a month of a month in which you were at least five years of investigation and at least 3960 days, old age and death.
Do you have to leave the job when you're up?
I'm still working as a driver in a workplace.
When I went to the hospital, the cancer's known to me.
Malulen I want to be a restaurant.
Should I leave the business?
Couldn't I use a fortune-based month without leaving?
I don't want to stay without work until the month is connected.
- You've heard it right.
You have to leave your job in order to give a monthly connection.
But before you get to the month, you have to count it according to the SGK law.
But if you have wealth, you will have a month.
You don't need to give a monthly connection, you have risks to stay without work.
That's enough for you to have 1800 days.
When you go to SGK, you'll take you to a certain tongue so that you can know my wealth, SGK will take you to one of the hospitals.
And when you get the health report you're going to get from here, SGK will use this report in his own body, and if you decide that your cancer's energy has affected your loss over 60 percent, it will be a reason for you to connect a monthly interview.
But if you have to fill the ten years of investigation, you can have a month.
So, that's a short term, it's not wise to use the SGK's SGK medicine, without seeing the decision of "You're unlimited."
But if the investigators are carrying all the conditions of any work, the SGK requests the explicit state of wealth and the connection of the month.
If that's a lot of money and other circumstances, it can be useful for him a little more early months.
Will the capital occupied capital beaten?
I'm a connect- Kur insurance.
I'm throwing all the conditions.
But they said, "You can't be a borrower because I owe it."
I have to do what.
- I'll read it valuable.
Who told you he was right.
You don't write what the other conditions are, but if you think you're carrying these conditions, the law is hard to pay for your debt.
But I can give you a special teyo.
I'm suggesting you pay your debt to pay for the payment of your banks or the car of similar organizations.
As soon as the early moon is connected, it takes so much months, and you'll pay it in your debt.
It's easier for you to pay the debts of your contracts.
What statistics is connected to the financial month?
I've worked as a SSK as well as a team and a team number.
Where's the moon going to connect me to a month when I deserve the month?
- I'm a valuable reader, if you work on a couple of stadiums, votes, SSK, and you're working on a number of stadiums, you'll be connected to the last investigation, so if you're in the last of the SSK, you're leaving the job, and you're going to do the same conditions in the SSK.
Favourite reports containing SGK
How's the material summer done?
Which hospital report can I get?
- It's enough for you to use social security administrators or social security centers for health reports.
SGK will lead you to the medication and research hospitals, to the university hospitals (now University and medicines), to the Turk Silvave, to the Turk Health Civil.
But if these patients are not available in the country where you can't find these patients, they can also be transmitted to the full-specific patients.
Isn't it possible to drive to a special hospital?
- It's just possible.
In the old edition, only governmental hospitals who have to be medicine, and their lives are to be tired, and their lives are to be made to be a lover of the patients who are infected with a new administration with SGK in medicine in medicine in medication, which is now in a medicine, and the medicine that can make up a special medical report that can be a favorite for those who are infected and who are infected to risk death.
What conditions are called for love operations?
The SEVK requirement is enough to have 1800 days primin in order to make the experiment of the explicit condition of the SEVK requirement.
The currency expensive expenses will be paid by SGK.
And it's not gonna be called for ten years of investigation, and SGK looks here.
In the case of connecting a financial month, if a person is in need, he's connected to a monthly period of investigation for ten years, which is independent of investigation, only 1800 days to find enough for health reports.
So when a person first identifies his wealth, the SGK's only 1800 days to determine whether it might be necessary to care for more and more materially.

Camsh, after Sandy's capital in the United States last year, came out from an incense around a house.
"The first person, please answer the following questions and send them down to the address below.
This is an scientific research by Dennis Comsa (12).
Writing, the person who finds a poison, is asked to tell him where, when, and how he found it.
He's also in the bottle, and he's having a missed money to pay a currency and mail.
In New Jersey, the 16 August 1963, was given to the owner in the last days.
Comsa, who was 12 years old in 1963, said that it was a surprise to see the piece of ocean, and said, "I was throwing some of them into the water, but I never thought it would come back to me."
The sound frequency is in love.
I was surprised to know what to do with the first sound engineers of Turkey, from Sweden Pamir sound frequency.
When you call the audio technologies or the sound engineering, it's probably the sound systems of everybody's thinking about music.
But did you know that the sound technology can prevent you from interrupting with terrorism, a sound frequency, a perfect murder, a secret that you can compromise, or an adherent to the world's rituals?
After the Steele University of Billing University finished the International CAE college, the sound engineering in England, and he made the audio technology on the Middlesex University.
The Communication Technology Academy in Galatiasaray also grows a audio engineering in the ETM and the audio technology, performance technologies, electronic music, and advanced recording technologies.
Subminal message of terrorism
"What's the sound technology?"
"A technology that can be used in many areas in the world.
Our brain understands everything with electric streams.
And the sound frequency is a type of electricity, energy.
By means of this energy, you can change people's altogether, you can move on with the command you want."
One of the most important substances of the audio technologies is the sublime message.
The music or song is placed in a frequency of man's license, but it doesn't define this high memory, but it goes down to the bottom.
For example, when a terrorist's attack is taken, Pamir says that he can make a music literature in that area.
If a message is replaced by the fiction of the printed song, as if it's set up as "Do not do this attack", it's the terrorist's selecting that message.
He doesn't understand what he hears, but his substance understands it, and it's like a voice in her.
He sees it as a reminder from Allah.
But in the world and Turkey, there are bans and punishments.
The Sweden Pamir is a submiliary message that has been prepared to tell the students about the subject in the Stanbul Technical University of the University of Stanbul.
"I listened to a music during the time of the Conferans.
I put a sound in the music called 'Suu'.
At the end of the presentation, I asked the students if they were thirsty and suspicious.
They said they're all thirsty in some way."
According to Pamir, there are some who use a sublime message, "In the past, some radio channels have been detected, but the details aren't yet known.
In Germany there is a channel called "Crain Radiou", a radical Islamists.
It's spreading messages with abusive, violent, religious advertising, aggressive, aggressive, drug addiction.
The German police know this, and the Turk police know it, but they can't start because they have always changed frequency."
Also, in the music world, these dangerous messages are used.
Especially in the songs of some heavy metal groups...
According to these statements, there was no terrorist on the waves, and it was performed by the sublime commands that were called in the substance of the pilots.

The audio technology can also be used in crimes.
In the United States, it's particularly useful for banking.
For example, when the police went to the telephone with the telephone, the sound engineers are able to determine where a person is in the bank, where he's on the phone.
When a voice hits a metale, a palace, a plastia, a wall, or something else.
It's also possible to define the size of the room, the size of the room, the shape of the room, and how many centres it is.
So it is possible to determine what kind of items are found, how large and how large it is in a room.
And there was a computer program that was used to do for this, and Pamir even made an opera building from Tatarстан, and I thought it was possible to provide a perfect sound order.
It's not a prime technology, but it's worth 4,50,000.
The sound frequency is also used in the mimari and deterioration.
Pamir has a lot of work on this.
For example, in a restaurant where the employees went, the high-quality meetings were made, and the voices couldn't go outside the meeting table.
Only those on the table can hear the talks.
The other one on the other side doesn't hear anything that's talking on the table.
The general system of these various orders is: "If you want to destroy a sound, you can wake it with a different sound in the same frequency and turn it into a helmet of the current sound.
Nobody could have hit the plane without this system.
Because the voice of a plane can't be too high.
These sounds are screaming each other and destroying themselves.
Even if your windows are open with this system, you can make a place of peace in your house without a voice."
Did the Egyptian pyramids be sounded?
There are also other interesting things that Pamir did with the first sound engineer of Turkey.
For example, he made an arrange to a clear air disc in the Movalu.
The sound can't go beyond the border, comparable to another sound frequency.
Even in a room, it can be quiet after a certain line.
Pamir has made a spot hall for the sports and concert.
I mean, it's good.
Because when you play basketball, you need a shit, but you have to be not in the concert.
In the openhava konsers, only a sound quality that can be heard only in the audio technologies.
"We use frequencies to destroy the sounds of unreasonable, sounds that are known as loud, to correct the man's tactics, to make your music more clear.
MTV is too far about this.
The openhava conservators are conducting, and they hear like studio records in the sound area."
That's the way the Tubbiak tried.
Separate the two algorithms with the sound frequency.
There were scientists who claimed that the Egyptian pyramids were made with sound.
They thought the stones could be removed by the sound.
I'm asking you, "Isn't it safe for bad purposes?"
"When I read from the Internet the University of the Timeten University of New York, I was so afraid that others would read it.
'Cause if the writings are tried by the good people, even if they are tested by labouring conditions, they can lead to unbelievable results'
"The Dul Arabic Effective"
Sweden Pamir explains why: “All the voices that your ears hear are spread to me.
True, man hears the sound that's only consent, but other sounds are actually transmitting to the brain and tiring.
It's supposed to be freed, so it's better to walk on the earth in the soil, to do the nature courses.
I think there must be plans for the shooting in school.
So the student will be consent to the only teacher's voice, and he can have a long concentration."
In fact, when the sound frequency is made up, Pamir says that if the prayers are read from the Arabic, they have a very rich frequency frequency of the Arabic episode, the sounds have a very positive influence on the side.
He says, "Am I need to read your prayers loudly, and when I read Jasin's trust, I'm a fictiony."
Love register with frequency
"Is it possible to love a man with sound frequency?"
Don't investigate in Pamir's way, the frequency of the person's feelings, and he says, "You must first find the frequency you want to love.
You can use a higher frequency than this frequency to make it possible.
Consider, for example, 300 of the man’s population frequency.
And you want to play a music that can make you feel with her.
If you lose the strength of those who have a single frequency on the 300 frequency of the music you play, you're able to get the power of those who have two digits.
Maybe it could be a love for the person who's on the side of that moment."
And Pamir, who mentions special sound systems in the world to be able to speak more effectively, can feel like a politician, a politician, a politician, and a politician, as a magnificent creature.
"Now in Japan, the trumpet that Michael will be sounded on the Day of Resurrection, and what is it that's going to happen?" And the answer of Pamir's answer is: "It's a voice nearer to man's voice, because it's most appealing to man."
It's a wonderful tool, as if it were created from a human breath."
"The prices of gold will go up.
Canadian Jennings Capital Inc.
In the first half of the world champional ceremony, the first part of the last week, which has grown up at the expense of the AA investigation in the prices, and the expenses in the prices, Hrushesky, China, and India, as well as the expenses of the traits of the traitors of the traits, as they seem to support the altars from the small prices, as they have been able to support the traffic prices.
And remembering that India was the greatest of the gold rabbis, he said, "I believe that the efforts of the cars are no longer rare to do the gold capital of the government.
People will find a way in this frame."
Hrushewsky suggests that they should make a long-storm investments under the restaurants, saying, "Alt, it will continue to serve as a safe builder.
It's forgotten the creative levels from the 'dispillin' lack of many Western governments.
The governments try to reduce their debt by decreasing the value of the money units.
That's why the gold prices will be lifted up from the current level.
"In the long run, it's written in the ability to reduce the risks of gold."
The World's Alternative Committee Marcus Grubb is a physical creature who offers more complex and voluntarily in finances of finances and vocabulary, and say, "Because of the gold and the risks of the gold, it's capital, and it's curious.
The gold portflies of small numbers show that the liquid is improved, and he has often proved that it's better to cope with more stability and uncertainty."
Grubb, pointing out that the alphabet of the gold ceremony is lifted in the last ten years, "Alt, the whole world's talent is represented as less than 1 percent of the world's products.
This means that the pychias is still important to grow up in the golden coat.
In this cycle, 78 percent more than 78 percent of gold and skeletons in the past year are evidence that you were protected by the investment of the investigation under the bottom."
"Hindia has to increase national gold tables in order to support financial growth."
The largest gold piano of the world, the Grubb, who answers the questions about Hindistan and China, has encouraged the gold price in the second mine of the year of the winter, gold and skekelege in Asia, to increase the expensive expenses of the expenses in Asia.
Grubb reminds us that in the case of the China, 54 percent of China, and in India, 51 percent increases.
Grubb tells us that the Chinese equivalents took advantage of gold, and if there was a higher trend, they would have been selling it at the second part of the China.
And on April, when the gold prices fell unexpectedly, the quantity took place, and the curves ran fastened.
In Grubb, in India, the government has a lot of preparation for supporting the India Center Bank and decreasing the probability of the Alte talents in the six perimeter, and so it may be difficult to identify the demands of a traffic requirement.
The world believes that the Gold Council should be viewed as a strategic policies in India.
Also, in order to support financial growth in the long-time politics, they have to increase the national gold tables.
Global Alternatives
According to the last week, the World Revealed The Golden Council was 508 tons of the world in the second part of this year.
In the second year, when the country's investigation was a significant increase in the country, according to the same year in the past year, in China 54 percent, in India, in India, almost 38 percent, and 33 percent up in Turkey.
In the past year, the fertility requirement in China grows strongly, the same year that the prices are growing up in the future, and it has grown 87 percent in the same year, and it has reached 276 tons.
In India, the government raised taxes in order to prevent the first gold colleague, but in the past year, the expensive requirement was 310 tons of 310 tons.

"When we started this movie, our goal was to make a short movie.
But the first shifts were so interesting in social media that we started to be excited, and we were shocked to take us into a long metraj.
When we went to the district company of Standbul, they said, "Do you have an artist?"
I said, "We don't have any authority, but I have 86 86 players from the land you can't find."
The films and televisions that have been done to this day were used by a lot of bad pollutions, and the man of the Black Sea was falsely identified.
You're going to watch 86 philosophers in the movie that you'll watch.
