He's not a good dinner.
Tom said he's not in a hurry.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Canadian.
Come to watch us play music for a while.
Tom said she understands why Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he would complain about that.
Tom is a member of my home coop.
Tom went down the street that Mary lives, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
And you know, and I do that, Tom, I don't have any chance to do it.
Tom wasn't sure she should kiss Mary, so she didn't.
I know Tom may have to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to do what he's supposed to do.
It would have been tired to do that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said she didn't think she should do that.
We'll have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said she really didn't believe Mary was really planning to do that this week.
Tom knew he'd be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone doing that before.
That's not hard.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me to learn how to play the drums.
We're not yet successful.
I've never been to Paris.
Tom said he had nothing to eat, but that wasn't true.
I'm a atheist.
Tom said she was in the house with a cold.
I wonder if Tom really thought it was a good idea to do that.
Tom said she knew she had to do that on her own.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was amazed.
Tom said she'd be happy to do that for you.
Tom said I've looked a little pale.
Tom told Mary that she should stop being confused.
Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom's hiding something from me.
Did you know Tom didn't start playing the Guat until he was ten years old?
I wonder if Tom knows if Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why are everybody looking at us?
I know Tom didn't know who did this to Mary.
I think that's what Tom did because everybody's done in his family.
Everybody knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me she thought she didn't know how to play the oboe.
I want to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could.
I know I have to do this before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd like to do that.
Tom didn't talk to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom is nice.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said she thought she wasn't sleeping.
I shouldn't let you go alone last night.
I think I'm gonna have a chance to do that tomorrow.
Tom said you were really good at the tennis.
Tom told me that Mary was an atheist.
Tom would have wanted to go with you Boston.
I know Tom is more creative than Mary.
I know Tom's more creative than I am.
Tom said he doesn't want to know why we did that.
I think you all agreed that Tom is one of our best songs.
Tom said he was desperate.
Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you read it so many times.
I did it deliberately.
Tom shouldn't have left early.
She's already married.
That's a blasphemy!
Tom said she thought she wasn't awake.
Tom said he was happy to do that.
You can't buy one of those 30 dollars.
Do you think Tom would want to go to Australia with us?
Tom said she likes dancing with Mary.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary couldn't do that.
Tom must have seen us do this.
I'm sure Tom's gonna run for the president.
Tom should have done this last day.
Tom may be angry.
Tom said Mary wouldn't be mad.
I knew Tom wanted us to do that for him.
Tom said he wasn't living in Australia anymore.
I know Tom knew he didn't need to do that.
I hope I didn't forget anyone.
Tom said she knew she couldn't have to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be so angry.
I thought you like romantics.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary, they're robbed.
Tom has already been told about the problem.
I know Tom was disobedient.
I don't know anyone who hates Tom.
Tom said I'd be able to win.
Three years ago, I was in Boston.
I don't think I can do what Tom does.
Why don't anyone listen to me?
Riches don't interest me.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
Tom said he had no problem to leave early.
It's not for starters.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were depressed.
I think Tom doesn't know how to go.
Tom has a lot of friends here.
Tom knows he was deceived.
I think Tom was a member of our club.
Where's your notebook?
I don't think I'll be tomorrow as I was today.
It's not likely that Tom will never admit that he's wrong.
How many kilometers are it from here to the railroad station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often takes the characteristics and speech that characterizes the best character.
Tom said you were his friend.
I think I'm going to have dinner at six.
Tom told Mary she's gonna do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's through.
Tom said Mary's dog's over.
Tom said he was doing that.
Tom said he's attracting his suspicion.
She's closed to her.
I thought you would show me how to do that.
I'm telling you that we have to think Tom's dead.
Mary has a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom said she thought she could do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It's smelling like someone smoking here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that's not right.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a child?
I don't think anyone notices what we're doing.
What are we gonna do?
I could cry.
There's no free lunch.
I thought you said we weren't gonna go to Bosm with Tom.
Tom's leaving smoking.
I think I know what Tom's doing here.
Tom and Mary said they'd be happy to help.
I'm sure that's not going to happen right now.
They're not as fantastic as they were.
We're going to school every day, except on Sundays.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't hungry.
Tom thought he wouldn't probably be alive.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was known.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
Tom told Mary she should wash her car.
They said they didn't want to argue.
Tom admitted that he did what he was charged to do.
Are you both Canadian?
Why would anyone want to kiss Tom?
I knew Tom hadn't really done that.
They said they had no more details.
Tom thought she loved me, but I knew she hated me.
Tom thinks I need to go.
Tom told everybody that he didn't understand French.
They said they don't want to do that.
Not everyone hugged, Tom.
Everyone needs to do that.
I thought Tom looked a little pale.
I turned the lights off.
She's a shopping addict.
Tom said she was back to Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't sleeping.
Tom thought Mary was listening, but she wasn't.
I thought you said it was a barber.
I'm wondering if this really works.
Let's go to the point.
Did you give the key to Tom?
Tom wasn't surprised when Mary told her that she should do that.
My father is a doctor.
I don't think I'd like to marry Tom.
I didn't know you couldn't sing.
Tom's often doing that for himself.
I learned a lot from this conversation.
I thought Tom would buy that car.
Tom and Mary said they're too busy now.
Tom said she was planning to stay home all day.
Tom should have apologized for Mary.
Tom said she believed Mary.
I'm afraid I can't finish this report at the time.
Tom was about 20 years old when he moved to Boston.
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary doesn't need to do that.
Everybody's doing that, except for Tom and Mary.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said she'd help us to do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cuts the Turkey for the guests.
I know Tom doesn't really know that he doesn't really need to do that.
I think Tom will understand that.
I didn't decide yet.
I know that's not worth it.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was rude.
It's not wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they were hurt.
I thank you so much.
Tom's bad.
I knew Tom wasn't a good student like Mary.
Mary told me she was home.
Tom said she thought she wanted to do that.
I know Tom's forgetful.
Tom said Mary was mad.
Tom says he's not guilty.
Nobody laughed at Tom's joke.
Tom said that it's not his bigger problem.
We're planning to go tomorrow.
I think Tom snores out of Mary.
What are you trying to do?
We didn't know whether Tom and Mary were busy or not.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go.
You better get off your shoes.
I didn't think we did anything wrong.
Everybody knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom has already decided that he's going to sign the agreement.
Is it true that you were there?
What do you think Tom would do?
They say they're not coming.
Tom said she was really happy to do that.
I think Tom's probably going to be there this night.
Tom said he could probably do that.
Tom told Mary she's never gonna do that again.
I hope Tom's crying right now.
You're really an angel!
Tom already decided that he's not going to run away.
Tom told Mary that she was supposed to do that or she had to do it.
Tom has already decided that he's not gonna do that.
Tom is a terrible joke speaker, because he often forgets the punchline.
Tom and I are hungry.
Tom and Mary say they're not gonna do this for you.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was trustworthy.
Tom said Mary is still scared.
Tom and Mary said they did that on Monday.
Tom doesn't know I've never done that.
Tom told me I should go to Boston with Mary.
Tom and Mary live in Boston with their father.
I know Tom's missing.
I would like to do that.
It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that for himself.
I was so excited!
Tom is a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom will have to do that today.
I hope I don't need to do that.
Tom had to change a lot.
Nobody's better than me.
As soon as I saw Tom, I could tell him he was angry.
I know Tom knows he shouldn't do that here.
He's here.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary is now.
My wife is a scientist.
I turned the computer off.
Tom and Mary told me they weren't ready.
Tom said Mary is still mad.
I'm absolutely sure I have kids in Australia.
Tom could have waited so easily for us.
Tom told me he didn't need to use a wheelchair anymore.
I thought you said you didn't do that.
Tom said he would help me.
I know Tom isn't in bed yet.
Tom said she thought what she did was a mistake.
They're not here, they went home.
Tom said she thought she wasn't interested in sports.
Tom wasn't impressed.
Tom didn't realize Mary didn't like her.
Tom and Mary said everybody knows it could be swimming.
And I don't think Tom's gonna do that.
Tom was the only one who knew what happened to Mary.
Where do you plan to do that?
I didn't know you were doing this at 2:30.
Tom said he's gonna be eight next month.
I wish I was on your side!
Get your pairs out of me.
I'm afraid I should refuse.
I know you've been lately retired.
I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we really do this today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should just walk right there.
I don't think you listened to me.
We are brothers and sisters.
I don't think Tom's done that.
I don't think we've done anything wrong.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone before.
Don't you have a television?
Don't give up!
I don't play the mandolin, too.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't have to do that anymore.
I don't know why you can't admit me.
The feeling is complicated.
Tom knew Mary since he was a child.
Tom said he's expecting to do that on Monday.
I don't think I know I love Mary.
I think Tom's going to Boston next week.
It's not far away from the hotel.
I have to find it.
Tom said she didn't have many friends in Australia.
Tom said she wasn't safe.
Tom could have used the help.
Tom said she thought she would be scared of that.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary asked her for divorce.
Tom says he's alone.
I knew Tom was a better student than Mary.
I'm Jack.
Tom and Mary said they'd be tempted to do that.
Tom said it's not the main reason why Mary should do that.
Tom said he's planning to stay in Australia.
After the rain, the right weather.
I knew Tom would want to learn how to do that.
Tom and Mary say they should do the same.
I'm not married yet.
Tom wasn't told that she's not still required to do that.
I'm suspicious, Tom's gonna have to do that next week.
I promised Tom I'd be there at 2:30.
Wining's always hard.
I'm riding a car.
I'm sure that's not the case.
Tom didn't have any idea that Mary was planning to stay in Boston for a few weeks.
I love the fact, Tom is back in Australia.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom said he would probably do that tomorrow.
They said they weren't happy.
Tom said she's not mad.
I haven't finished my supper yet.
Tom didn't know you'd be there.
I don't know whether Tom and Mary are planning to do that.
I don't think Tom's still sleeping.
Tom said she really didn't really know how to do that.
I'm sure Tom feels the same way you do.
Tom said he feels sick.
Tom said Mary thought that John wouldn't have to do that.
I hope no one followed you.
Tom knows he should have done that better.
I know Tom will be moved to do that.
Do you think we should talk to Tom about this?
Tom said she wanted not give her any money.
Tom may not be able to do that.
I know you don't enjoy yourself here.
Kindergarten kids are better than some adults.
I thought we could go together.
I thought I should say something to Tom, but I didn't know what to say.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary's planning to do that.
Tom wanted everybody to know that he was unhappy.
I know Tom wanted me to do that.
You look busy.
Tom and Mary looked at John.
They think they're stronger than me.
I read this in the newspaper.
How am I improved?
Tom doesn't like that.
They told me they would be smart.
I should have written it.
I'm not hungry anymore.
You can do it.
Tom likes to keep things on himself.
I don't think everybody's disappointed.
I thought you believed Tom to help us.
I'm sorry I couldn't come to Tom's murder.
I'm so happy.
I know Tom's gonna do that today.
I know some of your students don't like you.
Kyoko had good to carry my bag for me.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was hurt.
Tom said she knew she couldn't have to do that for himself.
It's not likely to rain tomorrow.
I didn't know you weren't planning to do that next winter.
I don't know what that means.
I think it's more important to discuss the possible solutions.
I didn't know Tom and Mary should do that.
Dom and Mary both snore?
That's the way Tom promised he would be here.
We're not going to vacation.
I don't think I can do what I want.
I think Tom's doing it well.
Tom and I know Mary wants to do that tomorrow.
I don't think I can explain the difference.
Tom said that it would be better if we didn't do that.
I thought everybody was a vegetarian here.
Tom said she didn't look happy to her.
Nobody's perfect.
I think Tom and Mary don't have children yet.
I'm faster than you.
Tom has a fierce sense of humbling.
I wish I was someone else.
I didn't know you were scared.
I cried when Tom told me that she and Mary were divorced.
I think Tom wouldn't be cooperating.
Tom and Mary took their shoes off.
I wasn't really planning to do that.
I don't think Tom knows that Mary should do that.
Tom said he doesn't care to buy that for you.
Tom wouldn't admit that he was wrong.
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
Tom and Mary said that it wasn't hard to do that as they expected.
Tom told me that he was psyched.
We should have brought lunch.
The first brand of pop drinks in many countries is Coca-Cola.
Tom didn't have to stay home to help us.
I think Tom already told us everything we need to know.
I need to buy Tom some new clothes.
I think it's gonna be fun to Boston.
Have anyone told Tom that he should do that tomorrow?
I think Tom should do it himself.
Tom said she wanted not give her phone number.
I knew Tom wouldn't want to go to Australia with Mary.
You should tell Tom that you're not planning to swimm.
Tom said we needed at least $300 to buy everything we needed.
I know Tom would do that by himself.
I thought you were right.
I think Tom will be disappointed.
Tom said Mary was working in Australia.
My dad's not a speaker.
I know Tom will not be forgiven for that.
I'm sure Tom's coming here on time.
Tom thought it was just like Mary to be happy.
Do you promise you wouldn't tell you that I gave you his phone number?
I didn't know that you did it for yourself.
I think Tom could solve that problem by himself.
Tom said he would probably do that.
Tom told me he was gone home.
Tom thinks she's not going home on October 20th.
I thought everyone was hungry.
Tom said he's gonna take it out.
I know Tom is a strange man.
We might have to go to Australia next month.
I always knew that Tom was deprived for greatness.
Did Tom tell you how he plans to do this?
Tom thinks she's not the last one to do that.
How dare you laugh at me!
Tom and Mary say they want to win.
I promise I don't tell anyone where he is.
Sport is good for your health.
Tom said Mary was moved to do that.
I don't think it's probably going to be here today.
I thought you said you wanted to do that, Tom.
I'm wondering if Tom really does this today.
I thought Tom wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he could win.
Tom said she was happy to do that.
Tom said she thought she was able to fix Mary's car.
Tom said he quit drinking.
Tom told me that she thought she was Mary.
Are you good Tom gonna do that?
Tom said she didn't have a lot of time.
Tom and Mary wondered why everybody's looking at them.
Tom and Mary know that it's not possible to happen.
Tom will stop Mary from doing this.
Tom said she thought she wasn't going to have any fun to do that.
I should have talked to Tom first.
I don't think Tom knows how to play the cell.
I think Tom might leave for Boston tomorrow morning.
Tom says he's not planning to do that.
Don't tell anyone where Tom is.
Tom said that it would be better if we didn't do that here.
They promised that they would do it.
I didn't know you could do that well.
I don't think Tom will be happy that happens.
I think Tom can do that alone.
She's capable of anything.
I thought you said we weren't gonna sing.
There's a dog!
I thought you said you could be swimming.
I thought you were motivated to do that.
Tom said she didn't need a break.
Tom said she shot Mary in self.
I wish you had told me this before.
Tom was surprised that Mary couldn't dance very well.
They told everybody that they were tired.
Tom was surprised when Mary told her she was only ten years old.
I thought you said you would just do that alone.
Tom thinks I need to sleep more.
I thought you said you didn't see Tom this morning.
Tom said he wasn't hurt.
Tom said she thought she wasn't happy.
Tom phoned to say he's not coming.
He's just an amateur.
We're giving Tom a birthday party.
They said they thought they could do it.
I wonder if I can do that again.
I often feel depressed.
Tom says she can't prove that she did it.
Tom said he thought he had to do that.
I wonder if Tom already did that.
You should have eated some cake.
Tom said he doesn't think you're not supposed to do that.
Tom and Mary think they have flue.
Who told you to do that?
Tom said she just did that once.
I knew that Tom wasn't a nice man.
Tom knew he should have done that by himself.
What's going on in the mushroom?
I thank you for your help.
Tom told me that Mary was interested in doing that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was a lot.
They're hiding.
Tom realized that he wasn't enough to reach the top.
I don't think Tom will do this with you.
I'm tired of homework.
I don't think I'll dance with Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I didn't start studying French until I was 30.
I think Tom is unbelievable.
It should have been easy to do.
Tom knew that everyone told me he wasn't gonna go to Boston.
It's not necessary for you to be here any longer.
Nobody looks like Tom.
Tom and Mary say they can't believe anyone.
No matter what Tom says, I'm planning to do it.
I'm proud of you.
It was clear that Tom was intending to do that last day.
I think Tom wouldn't be in Australia now.
I should have done this with Tom.
I didn't think anyone would help you.
Tom and Mary said they were homeless.
The earth is a planet.
I think Tom would be skeptical.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was unbelievable.
Tom told me that Mary would be suspicious.
I feel I could have done better.
I thought Tom was a sweet.
Tom said he wasn't expecting any help from you.
I thought you said I should do that.
When is Tom planning to eat?
Now we know that's not true.
I don't think Tom sees that way.
Unfortunately, Apple doesn't provide a rule for a accidental damage.
I think Tom likes it.
He's the lazy man I know.
Tom and Mary didn't do that yet.
Don't talk to nosense!
Tom said she wasn't scared.
I should have helped you to do that.
Tom said she would give Mary a book.
I think Tom can sing the country music better than anyone I know.
Tom and Mary saw you.
Tom thinks Mary will be able to convince John that.
I don't know whether Tom works there or not.
There's no question about it.
No one can solve the problem.
I'm not talking to him anymore.
I think Tom's gonna do that too.
I shouldn't let you do that.
I've already met everybody.
Tom said Mary would do the same.
Tom said he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom and Mary told me they wouldn't wait.
I'm not sure I should do that.
I think you should accept Tom's registration.
I didn't know you were going to let Tom do that for yourself.
I know Tom wants to do that.
Tom said she didn't look like she was enjoying herself.
Tom said she thought she would be sleeping when she went home.
Maybe Tom doesn't know I've ever been doing that.
It's a dead poison!
They know they're watching.
Tom told me that she thought she could speak French.
Tom may be sleeping.
I know Tom's not a good manager.
I don't care whether you do that or not.
It's not rocket science.
Tom said she wanted to help us.
There's someone waiting for you.
They said they were ready.
Tom and Mary said they felt light.
You know you shouldn't do that, don't you?
Nothing's done.
Let's make sure that doesn't happen.
I know Tom knows why we couldn't do that for him.
Tom said he thought it could happen in Boston.
I didn't know that Tom was an acompa.
I think Tom wants to be the next one to do that.
Tom said I was the one with the problem.
You don't expect to do that, are you?
If it's good tomorrow, we'll climb the mountain.
Nobody told Tom what he should do.
Have you ever hit someone?
I don't think Tom was mad.
I knew Tom knew how to do that.
Tom and Mary told me they were healthy.
I think that's wrong.
There's a place for everything.
Tom said he wouldn't be allowed to do that anymore.
I told Tom you were hungry.
Tom is so sure he's seeing a wolf.
I don't think it's your decision.
I thought you were retired.
Tom said she hopes she won't do that for herself.
They said they had to work.
My dad's not gonna be busy tomorrow.
They told everybody that they were cold.
Didn't you know that Tom's not planning to do that?
I was surprised when I heard that Tom had been murdered.
I know Tom is a few years old than I am.
Tom told me he was strong.
Tom and Mary say they can't wait for that long.
Tom thinks she should help Mary.
I wonder if Tom really told Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom will not let anyone drive her car except Mary.
I don't think Tom knows why I wanted to do that.
Nobody was there.
Tom told Mary she's decided to stay for a few days.
I know Tom wasn't the first one to do that.
Tom said she didn't need to do that.
I didn't think you would do it for yourself.
I don't think we have enough food to feed everyone.
I know it's not a bad man.
It's said he knows the secret.
I think Tom would be a good room friend.
Tom said she thought she had to do that.
I know Tom didn't know who did that for him.
Tom said he was good.
Why didn't you tell me that you didn't want my help?
Tom said she didn't think she could do that today.
I just want you to think about the possibility you're wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said she thought she should have done that next time she went on.
I'm as happy as possible.
If they knew what was going to happen, they would have changed their plans.
I know Tom didn't know that he didn't want to do that.
Tom is rich, but he's not rich like Mary.
Go wake up and tell him that breakfast is ready.
Tom was surprised that Mary was still upstairs.
I should have left early.
Tom said she knew Mary couldn't have to do that for himself.
Tom said his failure was because of bad luck.
I didn't think Tom would be alone.
Tom said he's not planning to buy anything.
She's got to be taken to the hospital.
Things didn't go as I hoped.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't get there until the dark ends.
Tom said she knew she wanted to do that again.
I know Tom's unfortunate.
Let me know if there's something I can do.
Tom said she didn't want Mary to go to Australia with her.
The bus came after ten minutes.
Tom's not home right now.
Tom said he likes ski.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this with you.
I think you shouldn't do that for yourself.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't want to do that until she gets cooler.
I didn't think Tom was hurt.
Tom said she didn't know Mary did that.
Tom said he's faster than Mary.
Tom and Mary told me they felt hot.
I didn't know that Tom was supposed to do that by himself.
We divide the shit three ways.
I don't think Tom could do that by himself.
Tom told me I was so nice.
How time is the show starting?
Tom knows she's supposed to help Mary tomorrow.
Tom's probably not going to play with Mary.
I don't think Tom knows who did that to Mary.
All three of my brothers are older than me.
Tom said she didn't know if she could do that.
I know Tom wasn't able to do that.
Keep on the next traffic light.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom loves Mary.
Tom doesn't need Mary's help.
Tom and Mary say they're lonely.
Did you fear the first time you were on airplane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.
I don't think Tom is the one who needs to apologize.
I'm disappointed in my son.
I don't think I've done so well.
Do you think you have a chance to do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a big superstition.
I was suspicious, Tom.
I'm sure Tom will not force anyone to do that.
Tom said she knew that Mary would not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing, Tom.
Are you sure no one can see us?
There's no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom's busy tomorrow.
I was suspicious, Tom couldn't have enough money to buy everything he wants.
Did he touch you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon.
Tom bought a lot of sotuenirs.
Today, the twentith of October.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go.
I hope Tom saw what she did.
I don't think Tom knows she's not Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I think that book isn't interesting.
I was told that it's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team will continue to improve.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom certainly knows that he shouldn't have to do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should go in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing this.
Tom said she thought she was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
Nobody knows I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said I needed to get more.
Tom told me he would try to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said she thought she should have done that next time she went on.
I knew that Tom was the one who had to tell Mary that she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I should do that.
Tom said she didn't think she was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's in love with someone else.
I don't think it's about Tom.
I wish I had a chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom would be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in prison.
Tom said she thought she couldn't have to do this for herself.
Tom said he wouldn't probably won't.
It's possible, Tom mayn't know I'm here.
Do you think I'm strange?
Tom thinks he knows everything.
Tom said that it's not gonna end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do this today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The pupils did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they weren't mindful of doing that.
You'll stay here until you are called.
My daughter's trained to be a tunnel.
Tom said she didn't think she could do that.
Tom and Mary told me they felt good.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something happened to him.
Nobody didn't question anything like that.
Tom was drunk and said what he shouldn't say.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they never met you.
I think Tom is a very good painter.
I know Tom's a recipient and tries something new.
Tom says he did nothing wrong.
I'm suspicious that Tom knows Mary's not living in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know Tom knows how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
He's still talking.
You're a nerd.
Everybody was late except me.
He could not resist temptation.
Tom will probably be angry if you do that.
I thought Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a libertarian.
Can I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom's gonna have to do that alone.
He wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing isn't as good as it was.
Tom said she didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted that she'd been rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about it.
Tom said she didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom is a little older than Mary.
Tom didn't know someone was hired to kill him.
Tom told me he couldn't eat the peanuts.
I don't think Tom would like to do that.
Tom said I shouldn't have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me that he thought he could do that.
Tom said she was very suspicious to Mary.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know it's a horrible.
He's the most clever boy.
How's your father?
Tom said she thought she wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm so sure that Tom didn't mean it.
It's not hard for us to do this.
Tom said she didn't look tired of her.
I'm sure Tom will ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it looks like.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he never planned to live in Australia for a long time.
Tom told me she didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has more books than you.
I know Tom's on the same height as you are.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must have been the one who putting drugs in my bag.
Tom said she's happy that Mary didn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she'd read the book that she paid her.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could have done it, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't yet told anyone they're getting married.
They said they planned to go on Monday.
It's not easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't speak so fast, please.
They told me they had bacons and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone that they should do it.
I think Tom paid so much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worried.
Tom told me that she thought she was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose the weight.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says she can't wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have caught himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one that could do this, didn't you?
Tom said he couldn't think he could do this without our help.
Tom thinks she's not awake.
Did anyone else hugg Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're doing this just to hurt me.
That's a mistake.
One way isn't better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything to his mind.
We married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be angry with me!
I don't think Tom could do that better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks she's better in French than she really is.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think Tom would do that?
That's his house.
I'm home.
You don't need to pay your dinner.
Maybe I should have tried more hard.
I thought Tom would do that today.
They promised them to check it.
I'm sure Tom would agree.
Tom and Mary said they don't want to do that.
Tom said he knew that he should do it himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the last goal, but the process of taking it there.
Tom must have put a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance to hurt Tom.
Tom said he was happy to do that.
I always knew that Tom was a troublemaker.
Well, I never!
Tom thinks she's not gonna win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said she thought she knew what Mary was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom really is homesick.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't sing too well.
Tom said she thought she was good in French.
Tom says she will always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as well as you.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know that I supported you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in serious danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I've just got a heavy egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next Sunday.
Tom and Mary are probably not able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this year.
Tom wants to know that she can trust her.
They say that they refused to do this.
I know Tom didn't know you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know Tom is really a close friend of Mary.
I know Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wouldn't do that?
I know Tom would probably agree to do that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows when it's time.
It's obvious, Tom can't do that without any help.
Tom and Mary say they don't really believe John's plans to do that.
Tom could have asked me first.
You're not really suggesting I'm going out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that soon before I got to.
I don't think Tom's bosssy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you keys.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why he didn't do that?
I would have done it myself if Tom didn't help me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone about that?
Tom told Mary that John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary did that.
Tom and Mary swore that they will never hit me again.
Tom said she should stay in Australia for a long time.
Tom said they knew they couldn't allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should leave before Tom.
Tom said she wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy there reminds me of someone I knew.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I already told Tom I should do that.
I'm planning to stay home all day.
I would like to do this alone.
Tom is the only one who could have stolen Mary's neck.
I don't think we're ready.
Nobody contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom's being confused by what's going on?
We're not yet starting to fight.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they were supportive.
I thought it would be a great idea.
What you said was shooting everybody.
Tom and Mary told me they were preoccupied.
Tom said that she thought what she had done was a mistake.
I hope no one's coming.
I thought everybody could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said she thought she was in her bedroom.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me that it wasn't important.
I know Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I'd forget about that.
Tom told everybody that he was doing that.
They thought there was no hope.
Tom said she didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everybody that they were pleased.
I thought you were happy you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know Tom's a lot of talent than me.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that's going to happen.
I knew Tom wasn't busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom is faster than Mary.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't have to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell you the truth or not.
Everybody's having a good time.
Tom said she didn't do what she said.
Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks she loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom can do that.
Tom thought it was hard.
We walked around the lake.
I don't think it's gonna be hard to believe Tom.
They said they weren't working on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You won't do anything like that.
You're so hot!
Tom was ten years old today if he hadn't gone last year.
They said they were so mad.
I know Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom is safe.
I know Tom didn't know that she shouldn't do that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like that.
I don't understand how this might have happened.
You're like my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom's already done enough.
Do you know anybody in Boston?
Tom said he could be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you'd be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that she was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told to do that.
We better tell others.
Why are everyone talking about Tom?
Federer was in love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them.
I know Tom could save himself for a lot of time by doing that.
Tom said she hoped she and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him angry.
When will she finish?
You're a shit boy.
Tom plans to do this in the near future.
We're late.
You're the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A pipe with some cababs is in heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning to do this.
Tom said she wondered if Mary could do this.
Who sends letters by mail?
If something sounds very good to be true, it's probably true.
Tom said he's hoping you don't want to do that.
Tom said he wanted not to be there.
I thought you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in a hurry.
We may have to be in Australia for a few weeks.
I didn't plan to do that, but if you really want me, I can.
I don't think Tom knows who can do that.
Tom said she expected Mary to participate.
I'm swimming every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They thought they didn't know me.
I know Tom is a shorter shorter than Mary.
Tom will do that if anyone stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll be successful.
You know Tom and I'm not gonna do that, don't you?
Tom and Mary told me they finished doing this at 2:30.
I'm sure we should go back there.
Everybody knows Tom speaks good Gaulish.
I thought you couldn't do that.
Tom said he thought he forgot something.
He doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom really got a lot on his plate at that moment.
Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
It's not complicated with the current technology.
They said they tried to be optimistic.
Tom said everybody in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he's not allowed to do that.
I think you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me that she thought she was a morbid.
You have a hungry sense, I like that.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do this.
It's not something I want to talk about.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think he's over 40 years old.
Can you eat a omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk any more.
I wonder if we can do anything to help.
Tom said he'd be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom is able to do that.
Tom didn't know that he had to do this for himself.
Tom's having a girl who's three years old than her.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom's gonna be interested in doing that.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I believe we talked on the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain truth in what he says.
Tom said she wanted to write a book.
I don't think that Tom is a slope.
He's not a ritoso.
I'm suspicious, Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually have to do that.
Tom told me he was calling at 2:30.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he should do yet.
I know Tom is a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should stay home.
I don't think that's enough food for all of us.
He's not the darkest piece in the drawer.
Tom said he's planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here.
A wolf can't be able to complete.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he didn't do anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he was doing.
Tom said I should be more harder to study.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't pay.
Are you worried about that?
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your sumbrella here.
I'll see that happens.
I'm wearing a suit, but I don't wear it.
I'm tired like you.
Tom thought he'd come down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right now.
Thank you, you didn't hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without the air.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows what we don't do.
Tom said she was worried about Mary.
We all got into the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that or not.
Last night, I was smoking.
Tom isn't very good at bowing.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wants to write a book.
Tom told me that she thought she would be mad.
I don't think you're paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is doing.
Tom said she's gonna do that tomorrow.
You both are welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's not anybody can do.
Tom said he's eating too much.
We're all waiting for your coming.
I think Tom will not stop doing that soon.
Have I ever told you about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was ten years old.
Tom said he wanted not to play chess with Mary.
I know Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said Mary knew that John shouldn't have to do that for himself.
I wonder if Tom is motivated.
Tom said he would do that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like that if she did that.
I still want you to do that.
Let me know that she wasn't planning to stay so long.
I didn't know you'd be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait for that long.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom may be alone.
Tom said she thought she wasn't busy.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said she was happy to do that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom doesn't know where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're so upset.
I've already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You finished your homework, don't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes her.
I lost it in the forest.
I know Tom is a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our group.
Tom told me he'd be in Boston next Monday.
Keep your mouth shut!
Tom said he knew he should do that on Monday.
Tom said she regretted what happened.
It's never late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary that she had to do that.
Tom knew she was sick.
Have you got a pen on you?
Tom let Mary do what he wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents will not let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time to do that for him.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I packed?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on his father's clothes.
I'm suspicious, Tom willn't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he was trying to do that all week.
You have a really beautiful teeth!
No one knew that Tom was the man who contributed most of the money.
Everybody knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said she didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was disheartened.
Tom and I were a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew it was going to happen.
Tom told me that he thought he could do that.
I confessed that I did what Tom said I shouldn't.
Did you know that Tom and Mary had three children?
It's not just a small problem.
I'm not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom's done that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should have done that.
There must be a reason why Tom isn't here.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that she thought she could run faster than she could.
Tom said she's scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom is a farmer, but I don't know where his farm is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said she doesn't like that.
What could be wrong?
No one could stop that.
Tom said she had to share a hotel with a stranger.
I know I said I'd do it, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's upset.
I'm in a little bitch.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my coach.
My class was cancelled.
Tom and Mary told me to leave when they came here.
Tom promised me to be here at 2:30.
Tom said she thought she could take care of herself.
It's not cold here as I expected it to be.
Tom said he's just gone from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to start.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I think Tom wouldn't be surprised.
I know Tom's ready to do that.
Tom told me that she thought she was jealous of Mary.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said she wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said she thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that?
Tom knows who's gonna do this for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said she didn't think she thought she didn't hurt Mary.
No ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows us.
Tom said he thought that those shoes were so expensive.
Tom said she knew she couldn't have to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same way.
I should have brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom's gonna lose.
They told me they were next.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary don't want to do that as they were the last day.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry, I didn't have a chance to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't crazy.
I know Tom did that just to envy Mary.
I know you're smart than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That's not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm fantastic.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have to do that.
Tom and Mary told me they eat too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
I know Tom's scared to laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was still mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners, I hate everybody.
Tom said she couldn't be sure she can't swim.
I don't know if Tom's coming tomorrow or not.
They said they were too busy.
I promise you we'll find a bigger place.
I think it's the only one who needs to do this.
I didn't think you would win.
I don't think Tom's gonna have time to do this today.
I know Tom's very thoughtful.
We can't let these stars go around us.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend.
Tom knew who could and who couldn't do that.
Tom and Mary don't think they ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
I think Tom don't know how to do that.
I already told Tom that I'm not planning to do that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not health to break food.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary are those who did that.
I'm sure I can sit here longer than you can say anything.
It's not yet done.
I know Tom isn't on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
Tom just turned the radio back.
Tom has already decided that he's not gonna say yes.
I know Tom is a little smell.
What's in the box?
Tom said she knew she wouldn't want to do that for himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would do it if he could.
It's the first step to solve the problem.
Mary said she planned to go.
Tom told me that she thought she would be out there.
Tom said Mary was lying.
I don't think Tom would be upset if I did that.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be there.
They said they thought I could win.
Tom means everyone, isn't it?
Tom isn't really in Boston now.
I hope I'd get a mail from you today.
I thought Tom was depressed.
Tom isn't a suspect anymore.
There's nothing here.
I thought Tom didn't do that well.
I knew Tom would do that right now.
Why didn't you go to Boston?
Tom said he's not planning to do that again.
Tom said that it made him so happy.
I know Tom could take Mary to show us how to do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary will say yes.
I was afraid I could be late for the bus.

I'm sorry we're tired to the conclusions.

I can't stand this sound any longer.

I'm sure you'd do the same for me.

I'm afraid I'm a little bit out of shape.
They deny that they pay the ransom.
I want you to know if Tom is planning to come here alone.
I hope I can help you on another time.
They said they thought I could do that.
We both know that's not true.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary was still upstairs.
They're saying they'll go shopping.
Tom told me that he thought his house was humiliated.
It's not easy as you think it's going to be.
They realized that they were unreasonable.
Tom told Mary she was thirsty.
They know they're tired.
Tom thinks Mary's going to be embarrassed by what's going on.
I'm suspicious, Tom was there.

I don't think Tom's trying to do that.
Tom told us that he thought he could be a famous musician.
Tom admitted that she was lying to Mary.
I know Tom would probably have to do that.
I don't think you'll have time to do this today.
Sometimes that happens.
I thought we could get together later.
I know, Tom is not the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
I think I have a good chance to win the choice.
Who's coming?
Tom must have been doing so much.
Tom said he'd call you later.
I knew what I was doing was wrong, but I did it anyway.
They said they weren't sure.
Tom said she didn't really believe Mary was really planning to go with us.

I thought you were living in a triangle.
I didn't think Tom would tell anyone.
They said they'd buy it for you.
I knew we should stay in Australia.

I wonder if Tom never gave Mary flowers.
I hope Tom wasn't hurt in the crash.
No, it's not easy.
I know that Tom's a good one.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was here.
I don't think Tom did anything with it.
I think that was a rhetorical question.
Tom's out of bed.
What's the best way to touch you?
What color is this cat?
It's not a cat, it's a dog.
Tom bought a gift for each child.
Tell Tom you lied.
I was a teacher for 15 years.

Tom shouldn't have eaten those oils.
I don't think everybody's disappointed.
I hope Tom likes what I've bought for him.
Tom doesn't seem to know much about Mary.
I think Tom and Mary are like each other.
Tom said he did that last time at home.
Tom said she hopes not to do that.
This photo was taken on Monday.
They said they thought they could win.
Tom said she tried to help Mary.
Tom and Mary say they'll win.
Tom said she knew she should do that.
I don't think that's right.
I don't have to do anything I don't want to.
Tom and Mary didn't plan to do that until John asked them.
If you had left home a little earlier, you would have been in time.
You can't be too careful when you drive.
Tom said she thought she wanted to do that tonight.
Tell Tom I'm coming.
I would have bought more clothes if I had money.
I thought I told you not to talk to my daughter.
Tom and Mary told me they just did that.
What's the opportunity to win Tom?
I'm afraid you can't.
I think Tom willn't go when we get there.
Tom said he's planning to stay in Boston.
I don't think you have a choice.
She likes running.
They said they'd leave.
Tom said she had to do that before Mary came here.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Tom and John said they kissed Mary.
Tom said she thought she was ready.
I know I'm lying to it.
Tom is the one who will be punished.
It's a feeling you can't join us.
I know I have to do this.
I can't believe you did this.
Tom said he wanted to help.
Why do everyone think that Tom and I are stupid?
What are the positive sides?
The battery indicator shows that the battery is not charged.
I thought you looked sad.
Tom said he's not planning to go.
You know I'm supposed to do this today, don't you?
I didn't think you understood what you were doing.
Tom said he was happy that no one was hurt in a accident.
Tom said he's not upset.
Tom and Mary told me they wanted to go home.
Tom said he wanted to kill himself.
Tom and Mary say they're doing that.
I'm sure Tom will do that.
Tom told everybody that he was skeptical.
It took more than I expected.

Tom and Mary say they can't stay for dinner.
My dream has come true.

I don't think people should do that.
I think that's a serious matter.

Tom taught French to his friends.
I thought Tom wouldn't be allowed to do that today.
Mr Yoshida is at home in French history.
I shouldn't have left early.
Are you tired?
I just left when I was asked.
I don't have anything to do!
I thought Tom could know where Mary puts the key.
I don't think I'm unreasonable.
Tom and Mary said everybody knew to be Boston.
They told us they could speak French.
You're deceiving yourself.
We talked to everybody.

I think you're not going to work tomorrow.

Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom said he wouldn't speak French.
Tom and Mary know that's not going to happen.
I was sure that Tom could not have enough money to buy everything he needs.
I didn't realize that Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I don't think I'll do that.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were working together.
I wish I could do it myself.
I need a little help.
I have serious doubts about their plans.
You could have saved me a trip just if you told me I didn't need to be here today.

My name is an insignificant.
Tom thought Mary taught French.
I don't think Tom knows I'm not single anymore.
Is it okay if I sit down here?
Nothing is important as peace.
I thought we'd get there on time, but we didn't.
Tom thought everyone knew that Mary was going to do that.
What are you gonna do with that?
I thought you wanted to do that this morning.
I thought I'd do it myself.
I realized that Tom wasn't joking.
There's no chance to do that Tom will forget it.
Tom didn't think Mary was the one who did that.
Prepare for death.

Tom said she was trying to do that all day.
It's a secret, so please don't tell anyone.
Even if it rains, I'm planning to do that.

I didn't know that Tom would be there.
I thought the end was perfect.

Mary says she doesn't plan to go there for himself.
I hope it's not too late.
I don't think Tom's gonna win.
Isn't that Tom and Mary from Australia?
Thank you for sharing!

I knew Tom wouldn't eat the thorn that Mary made for him.

Who is he?
I want that shit.
Tom said she didn't want to work as a waiter.
Tom told me that Mary knew where she was.
I thank you very much for your help.
Tom and Mary say they don't plan to go anywhere tomorrow.
I know, Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
I know Tom didn't know if Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said she thought it would be John's going to do that.
Where's the entrance to the bottom of the car park?
They say they'll pay everything.
Tom said he thought you would do that.
They're impressed by blood and violence.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want this.
Nobody knows exactly where Tom's going.
You should make sure you don't make Tom angry.
I didn't know we weren't supposed to do that for ourselves.
Some think it's a bad idea.
How do I know you're not trying to kill me?
I wonder if Tom really went to Boston.
Tom said he thought he was doing it.
I don't think Tom will be on himself.
I can't understand why he did that.
Tom didn't know why Mary was so angry.
Tom said Mary was probably going out.
Why don't you put some clothes on it?
That was not the main reason for Tom to do that.

It's not safe for text while you drive.

Tom said she knew what she should do.
Tom said he was waiting for over three hours.

My mother died the same day I got married.
Some people believe that seven is a lucky number.
Tom called Mary to tell her that she should stay in Boston for three weeks.
I'm learning Quechua.
It's Friday.
What's going on for dinner tonight?
Tom said she's not sure if John could take care of herself.
I think Tom's on the porch talking to Mary.
I'm about the same age as you are.
Tom said she didn't seem angry.
We're changing our clothes.
Tom knows Mary should do that.
You knew Tom was a ballet dancer, didn't you?
Tom said he needed to sleep more.
I think Tom knows why.
It's not like I don't want to do it.
I don't like cats and my brother.
Tom's probably rich.
You never know what happens tomorrow.
Tom said he thought he'd be the only one who needs to do this.
Tom said Mary doesn't think John would do that.
I thought it was supposed to be good.
It might be good to do that.
I thought Tom saw me.
If I knew Tom's address, I would write to him.
Tom told me that she thought she thought she was mad.
Tom thought Mary was chairing.
Someone should have told Tom that he was doing the wrong way.
I knew Tom shouldn't go outside.
Do you have a vegetarian pills?
I know you need to go to Boston.
I knew it was a bum.
I have a question.
Tom takes a shower every morning.
Tom said she knew she had to do that.
I think Tom could be the only person we need.
This isn't all surprised.
I know Tom knows he's not supposed to do that.
I thought Tom would know how to do that.
I think Tom's doing that, too.
Tom said he heard someone screaming.
I'm so seriously sure that Tom thinks it's a good idea to do that.
Tom knows the time's running out.
I think it was Tom's fault.
Tom said she thought she had a good time in Australia.
Tom says she's planning to go to Australia with Mary.
Tom said he wasn't probably not crying.
It's usually easy for Norwegians to get what Sweden says.
They told me they didn't know.
I don't like this store.
Do you think there's any chance you can do that?
Tom didn't know what he did was wrong.
I didn't know that Tom had gone home already.
Tom said Mary would help her, but I didn't think she would.
Tom said she had to go away.
Tom told me that she thought she was truthful.
I don't think you'll have the same problems I have.
This book is worth reading twice.
Tom said she thought she was ready to do that.
I wish that was happening.
It's not gonna hurt.
I don't think I can do that right now.
You look like you don't have any fun.
I thought you wanted to go to Australia.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was missing.
Tom said he couldn't do everything he planned to do.
Tom said she didn't want to talk.
I think we're doing a very good job since nobody complained.

Did you know that Tom had only one leg?

I knew Tom was a better dinner than me.
Tom knows I borrowed the money from Mary.
Tom said that it would be better if I didn't do that.
I don't think anybody thinks you're crazy.
Tom and Mary told me they had bacons and eggs for breakfast.
I know Tom knows she didn't want to do that.
I hope I don't say anything stupid.
I'm sorry I took so long.
Tom's gonna be so sorry he didn't do that.
They let me know they won't do that.
I'm sorry I can't come today.
Tom and Mary are scared.
I thought Tom was tired.
It's not likely to rain tomorrow.
I know I can trust you.
I know Tom did that right.
Stop judging me!
Tom says he didn't do it.
I'm looking for you.
Tom said he knew I wasn't gonna cry.
Tom said we couldn't do anything about it.
I think Tom's just interesting.
Everybody knows that Tom was the one who broke the window.
Here's my pink notebook.
I knew I could trust you!
I don't think Tom knows what he wants.
I didn't know that Tom didn't have to do it for himself.
It's not like Tom's going anywhere.
Tom told me he was intimidating to do that.
I thought I didn't know what to do.
I know Tom is a bum.
I didn't think Tom would let you do that.
I want to go and change the shirt I bought last day.
Tom said she thought she was lying.
We should stay with you.
I don't think Tom is alone.
This is not the first time I did this.
If Tom couldn't do that, it's probably nobody else.
I thought Tom could stop this afternoon.
I think the economic effect will be small.
You have to know Tom Mary's gonna do that.
It would be fun to do that.
Tom and Mary say they don't plan to do that anymore.
I don't think Tom will need our help.
Tom said she was nervous.
Tom and Mary said they were over 30.
I think Tom expected Mary to stay.
Tom said he wouldn't do that.
I'm not gay, but my boyfriend is.
You know that's not right.
Tom and Mary told me they don't want that.
I know Tom was in your house today.
Tom wouldn't be able to do this by himself.
Tom and Mary said they were going to work.
Tom didn't tell you what happened yet.
Tom said she expected Mary to win.
Tom said Mary was unusual about that.
Tom said he wanted not to be late.
They said they were suspicious.
Did you know Tom was planning to move to Boston?
Tom said she thought she wanted to do that.
Tom said she thought she didn't do that.
I thought that was what we had to do.
I would never do that for you.
Tom should have been quick to do that than Mary.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go on Monday.
That's not what Tom really needs.
They know they can do better.
No way Tom would have done what you said.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that anymore.
You're tired, aren't you?
Did Tom do that by himself?
Tom and Mary said they were studying French.
Tom confessed that she killed Mary.
I would be there if my car hadn't been broken.
We're brothers.
I wrote a long letter to Tom.
It's gonna be hard to find someone else to replace Tom.
I don't think that giving Tom a knife was a good idea.
I thought you'd kill me.
I think there's a possibility that Tom will do it.
It's amazing that they should have a second house in America.
They told me they were depressed.
My mom can't drive a car at all.
There's a lot of things happening right now.
I wonder if Tom is rich.
I don't need to do that.
I didn't think anyone noticed what Tom did.
I think you're bosssy.
Tom helped his car to check, but the raccoon that he runs on was dead as a doorway.
Tom and Mary said they're not mad.
I wonder if Tom had ever told Mary about what we were doing that day.
Close that door.
The only reason Tom went to Australia is because everyone in his family did it.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to the prime.
Are you sure no one can see us?
He's got a great fan of travel.
Tom said Mary was still in prison.
I'm not sure Tom would let anyone help Mary.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were jealous.
Tom and Mary told me they were homesick.
I think you know we need to buy some more food.
I was surprised to see Tom didn't want to go with us.
I asked Tom and Mary if they knew anyone who taught French.
Tom must have left his captain on the bus.
They told me they were broken.
Nobody just did that, Tom.
I don't think Tom would be surprised to do that.
I think you're not interested in coming with us.
It's not easy for everyone to understand.
I'm hungry.
Tom said he thought he was the only one to do that.
I thought you might want to drink anything cold.
Tom told me she wouldn't go to Boston without I went with her.
No one saw them.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was sleepy.
Tom said he would certainly do that this week.
That's not my responsibility.
I think Tom is a student in Harvard.
I didn't know I was doing the wrong way.
That's the best thing anyone has ever done for me.
Tom told Mary that she didn't think she was happy about John's going to be.
If it wasn't for the storm, I would have come too soon.
They said they'd do that for us.
I thought you were only girls who were less than you.
Tom said she thought she was too high in that store.
Tom said she didn't feel like eating.
Tom spends a lot of money buying things he never uses.
I thought you said I could count you.
Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago.
Tom spent the money his grandmother gave him on books.
This is the first time I left my family for more than three weeks.
You should have said that at the time.
Tom and Mary just say they'll talk to you.
Tom told me he had no friends like Mary.
I parked my car here so many times, and nobody complained.
Tom said he was sad.
Tom said she didn't think she had to tell John what to do.
Tom said she was back home.
I didn't know Tom would be arrested.
I know I'm gonna regret this.
Tom thought Mary was tired.
Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
Do you have any idea when Tom's planning to go here?
I know you're not planning to stay in Boston.
I'm wondering if this could happen again.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't keep looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
The facts are not available today, and they don't allow me to make such claims.
Tom said she's absolutely sure she's supposed to do that.
Tom would be happy if you did that.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said she needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could have stopped it.
It's not good to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom said Mary was asked not to do that.
We're invited to dinner.
Tom and Mary said they were reproved.
I know Tom's afraid he's gonna lose.
I'm eating the same thing Tom did.
I know Tom would be able to convince Mary if she tried to do that.
Tom thinks I miss a great opportunity.
I know Tom's not a good Gutar player.
Tom and I were impressed.
Everybody knows it's a lie.
They're not as young as they say.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I never thought I would go there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same way.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston on October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me that she thought she was wrong.
Tom decided not to work today.
Tom refused that she was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French and Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't get caught.
It's not gonna work.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said Mary thought that John would not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I should try to do this by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I wouldn't have done this without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do that for himself.
Tom said he's looking forward to his restaurant.
Whether we do this now or not later.
Let's hope you'll stay in this way.
I should have expected Tom wouldn't be with Mary.
I think it's unlikely that Tom didn't know that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I'm wondering if Tom really knows the security of this combination.
Someone sing.
Mary doesn't plan to do that until I tell her.
I didn't know you were supposed to do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the reason for a accident.
I didn't know Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that could be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know Mary was living in Boston.
I didn't know you needed to do that today.
You should have written your children a few months ago.
I think that's not mine.
I believe Tom is ten years old.
Think about it.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom could be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I didn't think anybody had ever done that before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
That's not something I know to do.
I think I can fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd lose.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times I'd lose without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me that she thought she was mad.
Tom already knows what she did.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I don't tell anyone where you are.
It's not gonna end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all the doors.
Tom's gonna be so happy that he didn't do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone.
If I were you, I would go home once.
It's not like you know what they're gonna do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you talking about?
Tom said he learned something new.
I know Tom's married.
Tom said he thought the economy was a bad shape.
I thought you were jerry-breeding something.
I've been studying English for three years.
Tom is the only man I ever thought to marry.
I didn't think Tom would be awake when I came home.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was crazy.
I know Tom's not planning to do that.
Tom didn't know you were from Boston.
It's not as hard as it sounds.
Tom and Mary screamed, but no one heard them.
Tom and Mary say they want to swimm.
Tom said she was still lonely.
I didn't think Tom would be arrested.
Tom told Mary that she wasn't planning to join the team.
You promised not to be rude to me any more.
Tom thought it would take a long time.
I wonder if Tom knew he needed to do that.
I think Tom is like that.
Tom had all kinds of problems.
I knew Tom would want you to do that for him.
I thought Tom would want to see this movie.
I think Tom's still undesirable.
I'm Tom's father.
I just want you to know that you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Tom said he's gonna do his homework before dinner.

Tom said he had enough of that.
I'm sure that Tom's on restaurant.
Tom told me he was very tired to study this night, so he just wanted to watch TV.
I don't think Tom's so bright.
Tom said she thought she needed to do that before John came here.
That would have been easy to do.
Tom said she thought she should do it himself.
That's very good.
Tom says he wasn't the one who broke the window.
It was clear that Tom was going to do that.
They're not sure they should do that.
The kind of information we need is not always available.
I wouldn't like to talk about it.
I didn't think anyone saw us.
We can't turn back.
I know Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
You didn't know I didn't need to do that, did you?
Tom was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I sat back.
Tom was wearing the tie that Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said they weren't alone.
The question isn't so much as it looks like it looks like it.

You're my hero, Sami.
It's not like we do anything.
Tom said he was humiliated.

It's not about them.
I thought you wanted to do that by yourself.
Tom had a key.
Tom knew there was a possibility that Mary would do it.
You're so lazy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canadian.
Tom and Mary told me they were hungry.
It's not socially acceptable to people.
Tom would have allowed Mary to do that.
I wish we should stay in Australia for another week.
Here's the map you're looking for.
I thought you said you wouldn't ever do that again.
Tom knows why Mary's planning to go to Australia.
I wonder if we should do this.
I know Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that.
This is the third time this week, Tom did it.
I wonder if Tom and Mary will say anything about what happened.
I know Tom doesn't know that he's not supposed to do that today.
Tom says everybody knows he can swimm.
Tom said he had a shop in his car.
It was clear that Tom liked to do that by himself.
I don't think what I did was wrong.
I knew Tom was scared.
Tom told me she wasn't planning to stay in Australia for a long time.
I thought I'd find you here.
It's not clear who wrote this letter.
They must have been tired.
Tom's doing good.
Tom said she thought she didn't have to do that.
Tom said she knew she wouldn't want to do that until John had time to help her.
I didn't think Tom would like that.
I shouldn't have got you into this.
I think everyone trusts me.
I was surprised when Tom told me he wanted to do that.
I hope I'll see Tom tomorrow.
How much is the water to fill your swimming pool?
Tom said she's still grochy.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't want to do that.
Tom said he's coming, but he never did.
I'm sure Tom has the courage to do what he really needs to do.
Tom says she doesn't really believe Mary's planning to do that this week.
Tom will eventually do that.

Nobody was on the bus.
Tom said she hoped she could win.
Tom thought he was missing his wallet, but he finally found it after looking for the house for a hour or so.
Tom told me that he wasn't impressed.
I didn't really think anybody really expected you to be here.
It was clear that Tom didn't do that yet.
Tom and Mary are planning to go to this street everywhere.
Tom said he thought I should do that soon.
Did you know your socks don't match?
You know that's supposed to be done today, don't you?
I think Tom is about to start crying.
She took him by the hand.
Tom said he was scared.
It's not worth the effort.
Someone's waiting for your office.
I'm sorry we took you into this.
Tom said he's not thirsty.
Tom told me that was wrong.
I knew that Tom could hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would do?
Tom told me that she thought she would be kind.
I think that's not really important.
Why is Tom wearing a cape?
Tom said Mary was able to do that too.
That's a lot of people's wrong.
I don't think I'll be in Australia next week.
I know Tom didn't know I couldn't do that.
I know Tom is too young than Mary.
It's not easy to solve.
Tom said his mother never loved him.
Tom should have been staying longer.
Tom knows he's in real trouble now.
No doubt Tom will do that for us.
I don't have anything to say to Tom.
I don't think Tom knows what I'm planning to do.
The men are wearing short skies.

I knew that this would eventually happen.
It's not hard to guess what's going on.

I can't stand this voice.
I know Tom's far better than Mary.

I'm sure that's not gonna happen.
Tom says he was born in 2013.
I don't think Tom's hard.
Tom decided to say yes.
I hope Tom's not dead.
They said they don't do that.
Tom knows it's a hard situation.
Tom knew what she was going to do would make Mary angry.
Tom could have done that without Mary's help.
Tom thought he wouldn't have to do that.
Tom asked Mary if John was planning to stay.
I'm so seriously doubting that Tom will be crazy.
Tom said she was ready to do the dinner.
I hope I don't start crying.
You should have done this with us.
I don't think it's impossible.
I know, Tom is a very good swimmer.
Tom hasn't been appointed by the chair yet.
I'm wondering whether there's any cheese left in the surgery.

We're not planning to do this together.
Let's check why your answers are different from me.

Tom said it wasn't fun.
I think Tom was in love with Mary.
Tom wasn't too powerful.
They say they like marigolds.
"Are everybody talking about me?" "No, Tom, you're not important?"

It's not something I'm proud of.
Tom and Mary are still sick?
I can't believe you did that.
I knew that Tom wasn't done that yet.

Everyone can't be happy.

Forty-four Americans have taken the prime oaths. The word has been spoken during the period of prosperity and the waters of peace, but often every time, the swimming clouds and storms are collected. In these moments the Americans are not only because of the skills and visions of those in high offices, but we have remained faithful to the ideas of our trusts and the truths we have found.

There's no way you're out like that.
If we don't take the meteor's threat seriously, we'll all die.
You're shy.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary should do that tomorrow.
It's not strange, isn't it?
I didn't know I violated any law.

Tom wouldn't have done that if Mary had asked him not.
I thought you said you weren't interested.
It was harder to do this than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom will go to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired.
I'm 18 years old.
They're not coming.
Tom probably doesn't know the rules yet.
Let's hope you're cured.
I know someone should do that.
I can't speak French, too.
You should have listened to Tom more carefully.
Tom said I should let you drive.
What's your favorite faster restaurant?
Why is Tom wearing that line?
Tom said he didn't want to wear John's old clothes.
I don't think we can do that.

The clock has stopped.
Tom and I were born in Boston.

They say they're ready to help us.
It's not open for the dispute.
Tom told everybody that he was unemployed.
I know that's gonna be hard to do.
How are you planning to do this?
It's out of me.
I'm a little bit out of shape!
Didn't you know Tom was seeing someone else?
It's gonna be hard to find someone else to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you knew that right now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom is as smart as Mary.
They wanted to say that.
I wonder if Tom is planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that Mary would be moved to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad nobody around.
Tom said she hoped she would like the gift she was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know Tom will probably know how to do that.
Tom told me that she thought she would be a mess.
I know Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who's your favorite song?
I promise you I'll help you.

Tom thinks he left his capital on the train.
I'm so stupid than Tom.
I know Tom can speak French, and I wonder if Mary can.
I know Tom's gonna be more quick to do that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they're not here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I think this is based on the fact that Tom is a little bit small.
I always wondered that Tom was a little paranoid.
I know Tom knew I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do that much better.
We're working every day, but Monday.
I know you're not those who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here last day.
It's not hard.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he would probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one who knew Tom didn't want to do that.
I'm very suspicable about that Tom did it for the purpose.
I thought you might be busy now.
Tom said we should do it ourselves.
I don't think that's an exception.
I know you don't like me so much.
I thought it was unnecessary to do anything about that today.
Tom has many things he wants to do today.
Tom said something about that the other night.
Tom admitted she wasn't bold.
I know I should have done it.
Tom said she didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.
I'm suspecting Tom is waiting for us.
Dogs who are dead can't do it.
I don't think Tom is crazy as some people think.
I don't think I can do it myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do this for us.
She avoided her eyes.
Tom's not like I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by ourselves.
Tom says Mary is still planning to do that.
I thought Tom should be wrong.
Tom said she didn't care what she did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have met myself.
Tom said she's looking forward to retiring.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I never fell into love with anyone.
That's the first time Tom ever complained about that.
Tom likes everybody.
I didn't think you were crazy.
He hasn't got a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought that John couldn't be allowed to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't need to do that.
Tom said she didn't have permission to do that.
I'm suspecting Tom is involved.
How many kilos have you lost?
Tom and Mary are all okay.
I'm a desirable man.
I will never forget the time you and I went to Australia together.
Tom is not the only one who's planning to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary decided not to leave.
Tom told me he's sleepy.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that she stole Mary's bicycle.
I've got the shit out of the shit.
Tom said she was probably in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you.
When is your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It is obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would have helped you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We can't play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said it was fun.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been in a dinner for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't ready to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary had a driver's license already.
I know Tom is a good drummer.
Tom realized that he couldn't change anything.
Tom said she should've done it alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy an airvane.
Didn't you know that Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I'm suspecting Tom's at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they would do it again.
Tom dropped.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy for Tom to marry.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not worried.
Tom didn't stay in Boston as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canadian.
I'd like to have another coffee.
I think Tom is still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone knows he likes to do that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here last day.
I know Tom can probably do that today.
Do you let your children play on the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom's suspicious that Mary can do that.
There's a cat under the desk.
I think Tom's a fool.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is that true Tom moving to Boston?
Tom said she didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you were tired.
Tom said I was impatient.
I think Tom could do that, Mary.
I'm interested in chess on those days.
I don't think I'd like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should have done that by himself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was wrong.
What you say is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I need to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary's thirsty.
They said they didn't like that.
I'm kicking apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said that they thought I was creative.
Tom told me that he shouldn't know what to do.
Tom told me I should say yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There's nothing left in the bridge.
Tom said she knew she couldn't have to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said she didn't know Mary couldn't speak very well.
I don't think there's any chance I'll get there on time.
I think Tom and Mary will be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I should do that.
Tom said she didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he's not planning to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom's sure that Mary wants to do that.
Tom told me he couldn't buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone likes free things.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I'll do it.
I know Tom is still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they were ready to help me.
Tom is not the one who told me that Mary should do that.
I thought you'd still like to do that.
Tom said she was wondering whether Mary wanted to do that.
They say they're not planning.
Tom is a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said it was Mary who told him to do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's upset.
I don't think I can keep it too much.
Tom's not like Mary.
Tom said she didn't think she wasn't worried about Mary.
I know you're a scared.
You're lying!
I told Tom that I didn't disagree.
I think Tom is talking to Mary now.
I already promised Tom I would help him.
I believe everybody deserves a chance.
Tom told me he couldn't be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do this today.
I don't think you really want to take care of that.
Tom said she knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights on it, please.
Tom said it's a good place to visit Australia.
I thought Tom was in a big trouble.
I listened to everybody.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom is alive.
I might try to borrow a hatchet from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone wants to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that someone cares about.
I think Tom willn't be in Australia for a long time.
Tom told me she's never gonna come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that for yourself.
I'm suspicious, Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom's incredible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know Tom's probably more likely to do this today than he was the last day.
I think Tom's doing something wrong.
Our streets are flooded when we're rained.
I'm probably going to be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choices.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew Tom could be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of the cake.
I know Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everybody's doing that, except for Tom.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everybody has a idea of what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could do that better.
Tom said she wouldn't want Mary to do that anymore.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was disappointed.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I think Tom didn't do that, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I made enough spaghlets for everyone.
I know, Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it's a good idea to do it alone.
Do you say you don't want to do this?
I know Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that it's not gonna happen.
Tom plans to sit back.
Tom said she had a book to Mary.
It would be impossible.
I know Tom will probably know how to do that.
I know Tom was a kid who was a brown boy.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're in a position to blame.
I'm not surprised that Tom plans to do that.
Nobody expected to win Tom.
Don't break my words!
I didn't think that Tom knew how hard it was to be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put your check if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told me she wasn't planning to stay in Australia for a long time.
I hear you gave up smoking.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said she knew that she knew John should be doing that for himself.
Tom said she was good when she spoke French.
It's not salt.
Anybody saw here, Tom?
Tom told me that she thought she was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room I do.
He did not keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he's planning to do that.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary want to do it as soon as possible.
I know Tom can speak French better than I can.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they were acting in self-profit.
Tom told me that she thought she was careful.
Tom was sleeping on the living room.
I found Tom and Mary like romantics.
Tom knows I didn't do that last day.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone he was ready to do that.
We'll go on a picnic if it's good tomorrow.
Promise me that you won't tell anyone.
It's not Tom who needs protection, Mary.
They said they were angry.
I think Tom will probably do that.
Tom did it whenever he could.
They said their homes weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I couldn't do that.
I think we have more important things to do now.
I think Tom and Mary were at least one time to Boston.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew she was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should stop sleeping.
Can someone help me?
I know Tom's on the same age as your daughter.
I know Tom is a very lucky man.
Tom thought I couldn't be allowed to do it myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's easy.
I think Tom will be alone.
It looks like Tom likes everyone.
I was surprised that Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to get into her new floor.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you have to tell Tom you're planning to do that.
They swear they'll never do that.
Everybody stood there, shooted.
I'm waiting to hear you think we should do this.
Tom told me that he wasn't upset.
I'm sorry I'm not as careful as I should.
Tom doesn't look very good.
Tom said she thought I should do it myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard the voices in the mushroom.
I don't think Tom knows whether Mary is sleeping or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did it, didn't you?
They wanted to fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I saw Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know the bridge was closed.
They said they don't want to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary now.
Tom said she wouldn't mind if she did that.
You shouldn't just think Tom is guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that Tom did it when he was ten.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said I was the only one who thanked him.
It's enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know that Tom did?
I think it's like that everywhere.
Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It's not until you lose your health.
That could have hit me.
They told me that they were missing weight.
My house is not big.
I'm so sure Tom didn't do that.
You didn't know I was still planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom wasn't clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said she'd never think she could ever convince Mary to go with her.
Tom thought Mary would be the first one to do that.
Tom told me that she thought she was presumptuous.
That's what I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy such music.
Tom said she thought she could do it if she had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wanted to speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom didn't have a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know Tom knew I was the one I had to do.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I left my nobrella in the phone.
I did a bad thing.
I'm suspicious, Tom would be interested in doing this.
I promised Tom that I would do it.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's so good to be true.
Tom said it would be fun.
Tom found it hard to obey.
Courages are green.
I shouldn't have broken with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom had a few bread to his dog.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you tell me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's not just possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm so sure I can do that.
Tom says she and Mary will spend the Christmas day together.
Why did you fail in the introduction?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says she can't prove that.
Tom and Mary told everybody that they were harassed.
Tom said she's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was real.
I know there's a lot of good food in the picnic.
Anybody have any questions so far?
I'm suspicious, Tom is suspicious to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anybody.
They said they would rather come next week.
What are you talking about?
Tom said that she thought she was disturbed by what was going on.
Everybody in the room did the same thing.
They're unreasonable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must have done that last year.
Can you take a picture of me?
We should have expected that.
It would be wise to do that.
Tom told me that she doesn't have a problem with that.
Tom said she shouldn't go home with herself.
Tom has to be angry.
For how long has your head hurt?
Thank you, bud!
Tom said nobody was fired.
Do you think we should go where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He has a earache.
I don't think Tom wants to do that for himself.
I don't know I can trust Tom.
Tom said Mary, who told him to do that.
Tom was imprisoned in jail without a patrol.
I think that the weapon I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me that she thought she was upstairs.
I know Tom is a million.
Tom said that it would be safe to do that.
I don't think I'll let Tom do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit that I did that.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we don't have problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This was the first time Tom complained about the voice.
I'm never going to tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's incorrect for you to do that.
Tom said she thought she could be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count it for us.
I thought Tom drove Mary a month ago.
I think Tom's not the last one to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom is downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said she thought she couldn't be allowed to do that.
I know that it's not probably going to happen.
They say that drug isn't safe.
I know that it's very much that nobody can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were so stupid.
Tom said it was a big mistake to tell Mary what happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never happen if you had done what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water.
Anybody have a kleenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could be a famous musician.
We've already done that.
Tom is a horophiliac.
I wouldn't say anything.
Tom said she'd be happy to answer any of our questions.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and we're both wrong.
I think you still enjoy drinking aa.
I wonder if Tom and Mary could do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think that Tom is the man you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You don't have to do that, are you?
You have a big head.
He's very smart.
I've never been hiding Tom.
Does Tom know that you've already done that?
Tom eat more than I eat.
I didn't know that Tom was in Boston's last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said she's still ready to do that.
Did anyone go with you to Australia?
Tom said he thought I'd want to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough for everybody.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early now.
I know Tom knows Mary's never gonna do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to hurt if they don't care.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary she wouldn't do that.
I'd like to visit Boston again.
Teaching and studying my time with time.
I think Tom's investigated.
I don't think Tom would like that if we did it.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary couldn't do that.
They say they'll stop doing that.
Tom's incompatible.
Tom thinks she's drinking like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do it, but I'm glad I did it.
Tom said she thought she wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said she thought she couldn't do that.
I know Tom is a golph, maybe he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew Tom could do that without any help.
I suggest you don't go to Australia in the winter.
What else are you planning to do?
I think that Tom understands everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom is a speaker.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big postcard collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're ready to help.
I think you want to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary's back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew that Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's infinitely Tom will do that.
Is it hard for a milk goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the camproom?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit when I was in the future.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts are faster than you.
Is Tom and Mary living in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you would do that for Tom.
I didn't think anybody noticed what you were doing.
I wonder if I can help Tom.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know that's not hard.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I thought Tom told you I'd be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia every week?
Tom said she didn't know she was gonna leave her.
You're not still scared, are you?
I thought you would cry.
The value of health can't be overreacted.
You'll suffer for that.
I don't think Tom knows how much to pay.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know it's nice to Tom.
Tom already knows Mary is planning to do that.
Don't take your gloves.
Keep it!
Tom said she's not gonna do that again.
Tom was supposed to show you how to do that.
Tom said she and Mary left early because she felt sick.
Tom said she didn't think she should do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was a friend.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know it's not the one Tom has to do that.
I admit that I disgusted Tom since I met him the first time I met him.
Is there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the television guide?
Tom said she wasn't nice.
It's true that the earth is around.
Tom couldn't help laughing.
Tom doesn't like to know that he can't speak French well.
Check that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should stop being crazy.
I told Tom you'd come to Australia.
Tom thinks it's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a smart man.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't mean to admit that I couldn't do that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever he needed.
Tom said she owes Mary a lot of money.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to get out of the dark after yourself.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary likes Boston.
Tom and Mary said they weren't likely to win.
Tom told me he was forgiven.
Tom said she thought she would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one way of action.
Tom and Mary said they tried hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I've never decided to do that again.
I didn't know you were kidding Tom.
I think Tom didn't make a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell me Tom and Mary that they don't have to do this.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom doesn't know that he's not supposed to do that today.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes she doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know that everyone's talking about us?
Tom said she knew she didn't want to do that until the next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think it's sad.
I don't think Tom will really win.
I'd like to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was stupid.
Tom said she thought she might have to do this for herself.
We wish we could do more to help.
Tom said he thought it wouldn't be snow this night.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said she'd look at it.
Tom said that it was harder than he thought it would be.
You would love the movie.
They told me that they don't really care about what's going on.
Tom's speech wasn't been like Mary.
I didn't know Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I hurt you.
Everybody looks scared, but you.
Tom was afraid that his parents would start asking him questions and that he would stop telling them everything.
Did you read the book in French last day?
I'm a famous doctor.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said she didn't think she didn't think that Mary was hurt.
He thinks I love him.
I thought you were a better chess player than that.
I'm glad to see Tom's happy again.
I thought Tom had left already.
I knew Tom wouldn't keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have a lot of time.
Tom said she was trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would do that for me.
Tom is the most funny person I ever met.
I'm really sure Tom's planning to do that.
Tom said she thought she shouldn't have to do that this week.
I know Tom knows he didn't need to do that.
To tell the truth, I'm not your father.
I don't think Tom will do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you could go home Mary.
Tom said she hopes she's trying to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says she knows she couldn't speak very well.
Tom didn't tell me where he was planning to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't need to come here.
They said they enjoyed the challenge.
I know Tom was late.
Tom told me he was going home.
Tom told me he lost his textbook.
Nobody knew that Tom was gonna do that.
That's right!
I thought I should do that.
I'm absolutely sure that Tom doesn't have any sisters.
I think Tom was the one who wanted to do that.
I'm suspicious that's not going to happen.
I wonder if Tom and Mary really tell the truth.
Do you all think that this is a good idea?
It must have been broken during the ship.
They said that they wouldn't win.
Tom said she thought she was a good dinner.
They didn't admit that they did that yet.
Everybody knew that Tom wasn't supposed to go to Boston.
I knew Tom knew why she should do that last day.
I know Tom is a man we can trust.
If I could speak French better, I could have done that.
Do you feel good today?
Tom and Mary said they'd be able to do that.
These captains aren't nervous for California.
Tom told me she thought she didn't want to go to Boston.
They said they were Canadian.
I know you feel grateful.
I know Tom is a prison guard.
Tom, Mary, knows that John shouldn't do anything to do.
Tom said he hoped he could buy what he needed for $300.
Tom said she thought she was the only one who had to do this.
Tom and Mary joined the army when they were eighth.
I knew Tom who did that for Mary.
Or a week, smell the roses.
Tom said he didn't like dogs.
Tom told me that he thinks he's gonna win tomorrow.
I'm really tired of living.
Tom thought Mary's dress wasn't right for the occasion.
Do you have children?
Tom said he was happy he didn't do that.
I wonder if Tom's really finished.
I don't think anyone can do this.
Did you know Tom and Mary were still planning to do that?
Tom told me she thought she was too young to drive.
I'll come back.
I don't think Tom's nosy.
I would never do that.
I believe we don't really need to do this.
Tom could have been more quick to do this than Mary had tried harder.
I knew Tom told Mary she wouldn't do that.
In my mind, you're wrong.
Tom told me that she thought she was deaf.
I don't think I'm going out today because it's so cold.
Tom was sure she didn't want Mary to join the party.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to do this.
Tom said she didn't want to forget to buy Mary a birthday present.
I wonder if Tom wants to play poker with us.
I don't think anyone can do that.
I thought we'd have been over all of this.
I know Tom is too smart than I am.
Tom said she's not sure she should do that.
I don't think Tom's interested in going to Boston with us.
Tom said she thought she was a good dinner.
Tom felt someone touching his neck.
I know it's not a history teacher, I think he's a science teacher.
Who planned to stay with Tom?
Tom thought everyone knew what to do.
Someone stole my lunch.
I know Tom doesn't tell Mary why he's gonna do that.
Tom wasn't the one who told me that Mary needed to do that.
Tom doesn't know anything about the plan.
Tom told me he had a few things to take care of.
I didn't know I had enough time to do what to do.
Tom said she knew she wanted to do that.
Tom told me he'd be busy on Monday.
I didn't want to wake up the kids.
I know I'll be arrested.
It's more like that!
I think you could do this by yourself.
Did you know Tom wouldn't win?
Tom said she thought she was in danger.
I didn't think anyone could do this.
How do we know you're not lying to us?
I think you all agreed, Tom is one of our best songs.
Tom didn't know Mary was suffering.
I would go to Boston if I could.
You planned to take pictures, didn't you?
I don't think Tom knows what he needs to buy.
She's happy.
Tom said she knew she had a good time in Boston.
The gods are pleased with your actions.
I don't feel so good.
I thought it would be hard to do that.
I'm suspecting Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm sure Tom didn't do anything wrong.
I know Tom doesn't need to do that anymore.
Tom said she was happy she didn't do that.
You're not a city girl, are you?
They said they'll be there.
Heaven knows we did everything we could.
I think Tom wants to see this.
Why do everyone think that Tom and I are stupid?
Life is not fair.
You should have seen Tom's face when I told him what Mary did.
Tom couldn't get out of his socks.
I don't think Tom can win.
I think Tom didn't see me yesterday.
What makes you think I'm lying?
A stone is heavy on its own.
Tom already decided she's not going to stay here.
I'll make you a sandwich if you want one.
It would be better if you didn't go there.
Tom said he was really glad you could do that.
You're not gonna give up, are you?
Tom said she wouldn't go home today.
Most people think they're average.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was crazy.
Tom told me that she thought she was going through Mary when we got there.
He went to America for his English last year.
Tom said Mary wouldn't probably do that.
Tom will probably want to do that like this one day.
Tom never said he had a girlfriend.
I knew that Tom wasn't a good song.
I didn't know French.
Tom said he wants to change it.
Why didn't you just say you didn't want to do that?
It's good you don't have to study so hard.
I don't think Tom should sing.
I wonder if Tom can help us.
Tom told me he wasn't interested in going to the museum with us.
Tom has a lot of toys.
I know Tom knew why she should do that last day.
Tom and Mary say they don't know when John is planning to do that.
Tom said he found something strange.
Tom and I got out of the car.
I think Tom will agree.
Tom said he didn't speak French.
They said they lost their keys.
Tom said he could do it.
Tom's not going to be home until 2:30.
He can understand everything I say.
Tom said she thought she was in her bedroom.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary should do this for himself.
Nobody, but you could have done this well.
Tom told me that he was impressed.
What's going on there?
I know Tom doesn't do that tomorrow.
I don't think Tom's doing that as many times as Mary did.
They said they were trying to do that.
The atomic iron is 26.
Is this the first time you had buzled?
You better get dressed.
It's a complete disaster.
They say they don't have any fun.
I wish I had to go to Australia with Tom.
You don't answer me.
I didn't think Tom would help me do that.
Tom and Mary need this.
Tom thought Mary did that.
I thought I should do that.
Dom and Mary know that you did that?
Maybe Tom doesn't know Mary's supposed to do that.
Tom thinks I'm a loser.
Tom knows he's supposed to do that soon.
Tom thinks she's gonna leave.
I think Tom didn't expect to be here for a long time.
They told me they were good.
Tom is one of the strange guys I know.
I won't tell anyone you were here.
Tom said he could speak French, but he can't really speak it.
Do you think Tom knew that was going to happen?
Tom said he wanted not to have his son bullshit so hard.
I know Tom is a clever boy.
How long do you think I should stay in Boston?
Tom and his wife have no children.
Tom said she knew she couldn't do that.
I don't think I did it and the teacher expected me to.
Tom said she thought she was too slow.
It's not like you have nothing to do.
I hope I didn't get you any trouble.
Tom and Mary told everybody that they were harassed.
I knew Tom would be hurt.
Tom said I was unhappy.
Tom thinks she's not the one who did that.
I don't think Tom and Mary will ever get married.
They said they felt awesome.
Tom and Mary say they can do it.
Museum is not open on Monday.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was stupid.
I thought we talked about this already.
Tom admitted that she let Mary win.
Tom said he was happy to do that.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't do that.
Tom didn't realize she was waiting for her.
Tom is the only person in our office who doesn't speak French.
That's so bad, it's good.
Tom and Mary decided to stay.
It looks like you're a mistake.
I thought you would laugh.
I know Tom doesn't know that he shouldn't have to do that.
They said the explosion woke them up.
I didn't know you weren't planning to do that with Tom.
Tom thought Mary was homesick.
They say they enjoy teaching French.
Tom didn't tell anyone to do that.
Tom said he's not sleeping.
I thought Tom paid Mary, but I was, uh, obviously, wrong.
Please wake me up in six mornings tomorrow.
I wonder why Tom gave me this.
Where's my academic?
I wonder if Tom told Mary she shouldn't do that.
I can't believe Tom would do that.
Tom said Mary wasn't his fault.
Tom thought it was a fool question.
Tom said he wasn't ready to talk.
Nobody knew that.
I don't think I can eat all of this.
Tom said it could cause problems.
Everybody's doing good.
Tom told Mary that she didn't think that John was happy about that happening.
Tom said he was forced to do that.
Tom's been tired.
I just bought half of what I needed to buy.
Tom told me he wasn't disheartened.
I still want to believe that we still have a chance to be happy together.
You're not going to shoot anybody.
He doesn't want to live in a small country.
I didn't know that Tom liked to eat.
Tom thinks there's a chance that Mary wouldn't be at the meeting.
You're not in trouble, are you?
Tom doesn't think she's happy about that.
I don't trust anyone except myself.
I don't think Tom will be ready to do that.
I know, Tom and Mary don't usually take vacations together.
I'll eat it.
I don't think everyone's upset.
I thought everybody was busy.
Tom knows Mary won't cry.
Tom told me that she thought she would be jealous of Mary.
I'm not planning to do that again.
The boss said we were fired.
You stay here.
I know Tom's gonna be a prime.
I think Tom didn't want to leave that early.
Leave the dog outside!
Tom said Mary was probably a pessimistic.
I was sure that Tom could have enough money to buy everything he wants.
Tom may be the last one to do that.
I know Tom doesn't know I can't do that.
They said they would write to us.
Tom and Mary said they were artists.
Tom is the only one who was not in Mary's party.
Mary told me she'd leave her husband.
Tom told me he couldn't walk.
You have a long hair.
Tom is still learning the name of everybody.
I wonder if Tom knows if Mary wants to do that.
I don't think it's anybody's fault.
Tom can drift better than me.
Have you already planned for the New Year's Eve?
Tom said he knew he should do that.
I thought you said no one would be here.
I'm sure Tom will know the answer.
Tom told everyone he was depressed.
That's a good thing Tom did.
That's the MY line!
Tom's parents told him that they thought he was too young to get married.
Tom said he thought he'd find another job.
Tom said nobody was hungry.
I'm doubting that Tom is still single.
Tom told everyone he was thirsty.
I don't think we should stay in the same hotel where we stayed last time.
Did you even know that his name was Tom?
I should have kissed Mary.
I thought you said you saw Tom do this.
Tom said she thought she wanted to do that tonight.
It must have been a shock for you.
Tom and I were wrong.
All our blood goes through our kidneys six times a day.
I don't think that's a bad idea.
She hit her ass against the glass.
I don't think anyone really thought he was happy.
We had to go to Boston last month.
Tom needs to do that elsewhere.
I don't think Tom would ever marry someone like Mary.
I need a doctor!
Tom thought it wasn't what Mary did for the first time.
I don't think it's good.
It's amazing.
I wonder if Tom is really planning to quit his job.
If I could prove that, Tom, I'd fire him.
I'm eating sushi every chance I get.
I'll never violate a law again.
I don't think I can convince Tom to stop doing that.

I thought Tom lived in Boston.
Tom said she knew she wasn't happy.

Tom said he would help me.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are married.
Mary told Tom what he was planning to do.
Tom said he'd look at my idea.
Tom's sure she's innocent.
I'm sorry I forgot to tell Tom what to do.
Tom said Mary was planning to do this by himself.
Mary's a fucking bracelet.
Mary tried on her wedding clothes.
They told me they were happy here.
I think Tom wouldn't be intimidated by what's going on.
I know Tom is a lot like John.
Tom should have let his children come with us.
I wonder if Tom's friends would help him.
How did you know that I was doing it?
Tom said Mary wasn't fun.
Tom thought Mary was depressed.
Tom and Mary say they're not planning to do that.
Tom was planned to do that last day.
Tom promised to go to Australia with Mary in October.
I know Tom is a little crazy.
I know Tom will probably not help Mary to do that.
I'm sorry I kept you waiting so long.

I thought I'd go with Tom.
It's amazing.
I wonder if Tom's scared.
Tom said nobody was hungry.
They say they used to study French.
I'm a doctor.

Everybody here is from Australia except you.
I think Tom is here already.
I'm not going to work today because I have to take my son to the hospital.
Is that your car?
Tom's looking for someone to teach French to his children.
Tom said she doesn't have enough time to do that.
Go and see if Mr Wilson is home.
I think Tom is just.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary she wouldn't do that.
Tom must have been hungry.
Tom and Mary should have told John they were married.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was a good dinner.
Red, yellow, blue colors.
I know Tom is a good drummer.
Tom thinks Mary was in Australia.
It's not just Tom's fault.

With a little effort, Tom would have succeeded.
I should have done this months ago.
This bridge is built up of stones.
I didn't know why Mary did that.
There's no doubt.
I know I made a mistake, but you don't have to get it in!
Tom is the best.
I don't think Tom will mind.
Tom and Mary are afraid of John's dog.
I thought Tom would want to do that.
Mary knows she's attractive.
I thought Tom would be more cooperating.

She said, "Let me alone."
Tom told me that she thought Mary was skenny.
I should have told you about this before.
I know you should be scared.
Tom told me that Mary was living in Boston.
Tom and Mary say they're not happy here.
You should have been a little politician.

We'll part in the marathon.
Tom is a germaphobe.
I don't think anyone would like Tom.
You better followed the doctor's advice.
Tom said she thought it was hard to be with Mary.
I think Tom's annoyed.
Tell Tom he should come to Australia.
Tom and Mary said they were disappointed.
I still make a lot of mistakes.
He's walking a lot.
I never thought Tom would forgive Mary for doing that.
Tom has a car, but he's using a little bit.
Let's go for some radiants.
I'm sure I'm right.
Tom told me that I'm the last.
Tom may not be ready to do that for you.
I thought you said you wouldn't do that.
I wonder if Tom could help us solve this problem.
I don't know whether Tom and Mary are still in Boston or not
Tom said he never thought he would ever do that.
I hope Tom's coming to Australia with you.
Water freezing at the Centigrade.
The bread I bought in the supermarket doesn't taste it very good.
In Japan, the new school starts in April.

I hope you get the chance to do that.
Tom gave me a lot of money.
I wish I could speak French.
Tom told me that he did it for us.
Tom likes to play with this dog.
I'm wasting my time.
Tom told Mary to do that in the other room.
I should have advised Tom not to believe what she says.
I think Tom hasn't left yet.
I've already said I'll do that.
Remember, we're all in the same boat.
I wonder if we forgot to tell Tom to do that.
You're a genius.
Tom and Mary think they can answer.
I think Tom may have done this.
Tom said he didn't decide what to do.
Tom said he liked the movie.
French isn't my language.

I think we had to wait more than 30 minutes.
I didn't know anyone who could do that.
I should have known Tom and Mary would be together.
Tom told me that she and Mary spent their summer vacation on the beach.
Everybody but Tom knew that Mary was in love with her.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary are able to do that.
They're wrong.
I don't think Tom would have been fun to do that.
They said they knew I was coming.
I don't want to be here more than you do.
Is Tom planning to stay in the house all day?
I know Tom's gonna be quick to do that from Mary.
I know Tom is a smell.

You can't do that.
Tom's gonna be very upset if that happens.
I wish I was better in French.
Tom says he has some paperwork to do.
Tom's not afraid of anyone.
They're not sure they want to do this.

Where's my money?

Now you're talking about it, I can smell it, and I can.
Are you suggesting I'm lying?
Tom spoke to Mary too.
Tom said she wasn't depressed.
I don't think Tom knows who's going to help Mary.
You confused the students.
I'm suspecting Tom will come to Boston.
It's not safe to drink this water.
I know you don't know how to speak French.
You could have warned me.
Mr Tatuya's in the woods.
I'm almost sure that's not the case.
Tom told me that he's not gonna do that.
I think we can change it.
I want to know what I'm doing is right.
Tom said I should stay and help Mary.
It wasn't a nice experience.
Tom said he couldn't remember anything.
I know how he asks questions.

My brother is now in Australia.
I think Tom's plan is better than Mary.
I need to get some shut up.
I'm a introvert.
I shouldn't ever come to Boston.

I'm sure I can overcome any difficult.
I don't think you should tell Tom what he needs to do.
They knew they should do that.
I'm so sure Tom can help Mary.
I know you did that.
I'm worried about my future.
How can anyone do that to a child?
I know Tom knows we don't need to do that.
I know Tom doesn't know why he should do that for himself.
That's not exactly what happened.
They told me they were sure.
Tom said she didn't think that this would be so fun.
Tom thinks Mary always packs too much in his suitcase.
I know Tom can do that better than Mary.
My heart's insulting.
Tom decided she's not gonna stay here.
Tom and Mary agreed to be here at 2:30, but they're not here yet.
Who did this?
I knew Tom would be hurt if you did that.
They said they weren't crying.
You know Tom is very uncomfortable to do that, don't you?

I know Tom's a little old fascinating.
I know Tom will do this with me.
I wonder if we're gonna be okay.
I thought it wouldn't rain today.

It's not anybody's ashamed of it.
I should have thought about that before.
Anything else you want to know?
Tom said he was happy to do this when you were in Australia.
I'm against death.
What are we doing here?
I forgot to tell Tom I wanted to do that.
I would write a letter if I had more time.
I didn't know that Tom would care if you did that.
I can't give you a certain answer today.
I don't think Tom would ever be able to do that.
I knew Tom was a little bit at the airport.
I think Tom willn't go.
Tom may have to do that.
Tom and Mary say they were hungry.
I don't think I'd have the courage to do that.
They thought they'd be busy.
I should have been true.
Tom knows I don't need to do that.
I have no doubt that you're the woman I'm going to marry.
He hasn't got a mobile phone.
I don't think Tom will help us do that.
Tom promised Mary she wouldn't do that again.
Who else knows I'm here?

I haven't told anyone else yet.
You know Tom doesn't like that.
They say they're Canadian.
I don't think you'll be able to do that.
I think Tom can run better than Mary.
I'm not gonna let you do that.

I remember it!
I'm a bike to work.
Tom told me that she thought she would be reasonable.
Tom said she knew that she could do it alone.

I don't eat as much as you do.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
Tom said she had to wait for Mary.
Tom tried to do it, but he couldn't.
Tom didn't want anyone to be sad.
Tom said she thought she would be upset if she did that.
We're done.
I know you, Tom.
I don't think Tom could take Mary to do that.
Tom said she'd give Mary a book.
Tom said she's not happy.
Tom should have forgotten to tell Mary that.
I think Tom is talent.
Someone had to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are crazy.

Who are you calling a stupid?

I don't think Tom is Mary's boyfriend.
Tom said he thought he should do that.

The road is long.
Tom is a good carpenter.

It's gonna be hard to do.
I thought I'd try to do that again.

I didn't want to know that I wouldn't do that.
Tom and I need help.
Are you hungry too?
I'm sure we've ever been in any real danger.
Did you know Tom was gonna win?
They're saying they don't think they're screaming.
The doctor said that this disease is safe.

We found that Tom was a thief.
Tom didn't want to return to Boston.

I would have done it at that time.
Tom and I'm a little busy.
Tom told me he'd leave his wife.
It'll probably be hard for Tom to win.

They thought they'd be cool.
I don't think who's doing that.
I didn't know you were planning to do this today.
Why is Tom mad at Mary?
They say they want something to eat.
Tom helps anyone who asks for help.
I know Tom is a member.
I'm very serious about that Tom will be here.
That book is too old.
No one of us plans to stay here for a long time.

I thought you were supposed to do that right now.
Maybe Tom doesn't know she's probably gonna be fired.

Tom said he was asked to help.
I never thought Tom would ever talk to me again.
It's not so cold today.
Tom willn't be here until 2:30.
Tom is the only one I know who was in Australia.
I promise I don't tell anyone what you're doing.
They put their wimsuits on it.
Hurry up, Tom.
You should have talked softly.
If you were there, we would have had a good time together.
Tom said he wasn't happy here.
I'm in a loss for words.
Tom and Mary said they liked to do that.
Tom and I are just a little busy.
They said they felt manipulated.
I don't think Tom would be moved to do that.
Tom said it wasn't like Mary was a good time.
Tom said she wasn't interested in doing that.
You should at least have told Tom and Mary that they don't have to do that anymore.
I knew Tom wouldn't cry.
I think Tom wants to live in Australia.
I thought I could handle it myself, but I couldn't.
It's not the evening.
Tom thought everyone knew that Mary was going to do that.
I know, Tom didn't know why Mary did that for himself.
Tom said he could run at least and Mary.
That's the most decent film I ever saw.
Tom plans to go soon.
You're not upset, are you?
Tom said she thought she was planning to go to Boston with her.
Let's go to the park where it isn't shit.

Eat whatever you want.

How did you know Tom couldn't do that?
Tom's not in good terms with his family.
Tom can see what Mary can't do.
Tom said he hoped he could know how to do that.
Tom and Mary were silent for a long time.
I'm starting to remember it.
If I had the money, I would just buy this computer.
We're already mounting it.
Tom and Mary said they'd make it at the time.
I don't think Tom knows how well she could speak French.
Tom told everybody that he was happy about what was going on.
The price of a three percent of rose.
They say they were asked to help.
Tom knows he has no choice.

Wait!
I didn't say I was born in Australia.
Tom did that for the purpose.
I thought Tom had a party last night.
I know Tom didn't know you needed to do that.
Tom's already planning to do that.
Who's the photographer?
I knew that Tom was a gun owner, but I didn't know he had so much weapons.
I didn't understand.
I'm glad I'm still able to do that.
They put their phones away.
I think Tom would help us if he was there.
They said they were excited.
They're doctors.
Tom and Mary should have been awake.
Tom and Mary said they didn't plan together.
They said they were tired.

Tom and Mary are planning to stay in Boston for a few days.
Keep the grass away.
Tom and Mary said they felt lonely.
Tom said we should be patient.
Is that true to Tom living in Australia?
As a rule, we have three dinners for a day.
Is that true, Tom thinks I believe that?
I'm playing volleyball now.
They say they can't help.
Nobody knows that Tom didn't do that.
I don't think anyone does that.

Tom told me that she thought she was good.
I know you're not doing that right now.
We already know that.

Tom knows he's supposed to do something, but he doesn't know what.
I'm sorry, Tom thinks like that.

We're a team.
Do Tom and Mary know if they want to leave?
Tom said he thought he could do that by 2:30.
Tom plans to go, too.
Tom's doubts that Mary can take care of herself.
Tom said she thought she should do that.
I don't think it's gonna be difficult to convince Tom that.
Tom said he thought he could do that.
Tom's happy.
Tom and Mary are conservative.
Tom said she thought she couldn't be allowed to do that by himself.
I'm praying.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was satisfied.
I don't think Tom knows the whole story.
I don't even think Tom saw me.
Put on your shirt.
It's the same for me.
I'm the first musician in my family.
Some people say that true love doesn't exist.
I'm not very good to get people up quickly.
Tom told me I could use his computer.
The first person I met in Australia was Tom.
Everybody but Tom knew that he had no need to stay in Boston.

They know that Tom means business.
Tom said Mary knew that John could be allowed to do this after his birthday.
I don't think that was the problem.
They told me they felt good.

It's unfortunate.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was down there.

This man is not my husband.
Tom said he didn't believe that.
I'm so sure I wasn't gonna do that.
Tom must have been very tired when he came home.
I'm so sure Tom can't speak French.
No chance, Tom will help us.
I don't think you can eat it.
Tom said he's gonna try to do that.
I thought it was a hypocritical.
Tom works in a store that doesn't work far away from her life.
I thought you said you didn't want to talk about it.
I don't know anybody there for Tom.
Tom told me he was faster than Mary.
I don't think Tom's still upset.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was fired.
It's not a bad plan.
Did Tom know you were planning to do that?
Tom convinced me that you were the best person for the job.
Tom thought Mary wouldn't do that for her.
That water isn't cold.
I think Tom stayed in Boston last Sunday.
How can anybody say to someone like that is beyond me?
They said they were busy.
I know Tom's in his room packing his suitcase.
Do you really think you can convince Tom to buy you?
I don't think anybody saw us doing that.
Tom told you to speak French.
I had to go to the dentist last week.
They told me they were shy.
I don't think Tom is adopted.
I swear I'm not high.
Tom and Mary gave me their old car.
Tom said she didn't see Mary for a long time.
Tom and I know that you did it.
Tom told Mary I was broken.
I know Tom and Mary were sick.
I don't understand why anyone wants to do that.
Tom said he's interested in learning how to do this.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary what to do.
They still hope they can do that.
Tom said he was driving out of the way.
"Would anyone with you?" "No, I was alone."
I know you're not.
Tom told everybody he was unwilling to do that.
This box is too heavy!
I thought you wanted to go to Boston.
I met someone who knew the last day, Tom.
I know you can't get out of this.
Every time anybody knocked on the door, my dog starts shit.
Tom and Mary have the same problem.
There's no way you can do this for yourself.
I'm afraid something's wrong with Tom.
The money was hard to count.
I want to know who's coming with us.
I never met anyone like you before.
It would have been hard to do that.
Tom may be ready to do that.
Tom will try to help Mary do that.
It might have been worse.
Tom thinks this wouldn't be a good idea.
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Tom and I didn't go to the meeting last day.
How did you come to the party?
Do you think Tom's already retired?
I'm wondering if Tom still remembers how to do that.
Didn't you know Tom was living for Boston?
I don't think it's going to rain, but I'll take a hobrella in case.
Tom promised to tell us.
Tom said he thought it wasn't necessary to be hurry.
Tom and I are still high school students.
You're making a big mistake.
Tom says he saw a ghost.
Tom thinks she won't be lonely.
Tom and Mary said they would help.
Did the cubrella you found belong to Tom?
Tom should have done a lot better.
I know Tom's not at all at home at Monday.
I think Tom really hates you.
I know Tom would like to do that by himself.
Tom said he's gonna be retired next October.
I didn't know that Tom played the trumpet.
Do you think it'll rain this weekend?
I know Tom probably didn't do what he was supposed to do.
I don't remember asking you to do that.
There's no way I'm going to let you do that.
Tom told everyone he was alone.
I wonder if Tom is still busy.
What's the name of our CEO?
I know you're worried about Tom.
I thought I was so good.
Tom admitted that she was worried.
Nobody could hear what Tom said.
Tom told me she'd visit Mary in the next summer.
They're good Queens.
Not everybody's ready.
It's gonna be a storm.
Tom must have been skeptical.
Where's the meeting going to be?
I think Tom is wrong.
Tom said Mary thought John wouldn't want to do that.
I thought it would be easy to do that.
Tom says she hopes she knows she's supposed to do that.
It's not cold today like it's the last day.
That's not a game for kids.
I hope you'll wait for us.
Tom said she hoped she'd be here today.
Tom said Mary was worried.
Tom and Mary said they enjoyed teaching French.
Tom said she was really happy to do that.

I didn't know how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know Tom's doing that well.
Tom said nothing changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know Tom knows I need to do that.
Stay away from this.
I know Tom's afraid he's gonna be fired.
If I were you, I would call the doctor.
I didn't feel hungry.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Do you have a kid that I can borrow?
I didn't think we could find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom's not an angel.
I think Tom is crazy.
That sounds awesome.
Tom's moving to Mary's apartment to give him something.
Tom said she thought she was waiting.
Tom said he didn't think that the smell was hurting Mary.
Tom said he's ready to do this for us.
Can you believe Tom's still nine?
Tom sent her picture.
Tom already knows that Mary's not planning to be here today.
They say they're never eating Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary were never at all to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone sing.
I heard Tom plans to move to Australia.
It's not so hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I'm here.
No one saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom was living in Boston.
Tom went back home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he could win.
Tom had no problem with Mary.
I thought Tom didn't want to do that.
How do you know that you don't misjudge me for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't do that.
I'm starting to believe that Tom will never believe that he's wrong.
Tom said she didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom shouldn't have let him out of prison.
His train is on the main station at 550 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said Mary thought that John should be done by himself.
I know what I'm gonna do.
He didn't need the summer.
Tom and Mary weren't home when we visited them.
Tom thinks I need to do this today.
Tom admits he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a feeling that we didn't visit Tom when we had a chance.
Tom told me you were with him last evening.
Tom and I didn't know we were the ones we had to do.
I'm so tired that I can walk hard.
They thought they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but don't talk.
You set a trap.
I should have added salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary were married.
I think Tom's smashed.
Tom and Mary will never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have gone home by himself.
Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she's not planning to do that for himself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were depressed.
Tom didn't tell us what he should do yet.
I know you probably didn't have to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we first met.
If you had helped me last day, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said she expected Mary to return to Boston on October 20.
Tom said she thought she should do that again.
Tom think you want me to pay the money.
Tom and Mary said they weren't swimming.
I knew Tom told Mary she couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize they're being ignored.
If Tom left at 2:30, he would have been here now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
No doubt Tom was used to live in Australia.
Tom decided to stay in Australia for three days.
Tom said he thought I was unconscious.
I should stay and help Tom.
Tom said he thought I'd be able to do that.
I thought Tom would be panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimmer here.
I wonder if it's snow tomorrow.
I'm wondering if Tom's pleased.
I'm fucking fishing.
The wind calmed at night.
Tom said that it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done this now if she really planned to do it.
I know Tom could do that if he really needed it.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted that she killed Mary.
Didn't you know your taillights didn't work?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom will never hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto so quickly.
You're not going to be troubled for helping me, are you?
I heard that women spend more shoes than men.
I think Tom will be excited.
We're going to be in 15 minutes.
Tom said she would take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you were gonna fix it.
I hope I should never do that.
Tom has already been told that he's not allowed to do that.
They say they're incorrect.
I know Tom didn't know he couldn't do that.
Tom should have told me before.
I have to go to the truck.
Both men have apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said she didn't really think she would do that.
They say they need to do that too.
I know Tom knows why Mary should do that.
They told me they would help me.
I don't think I can ever buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought she didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they don't think they're screaming.
I knew Tom was active in her church.
Everybody knew Tom could speak well in French.
Tom said he found something.
It's not a payment.
Tom said she hadn't ever thought Mary was in Australia.
I don't think Tom looks good like John.
Tom said that she thought it was too high in that store.
I don't think anybody's arguing about that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he hoped he could do this today.
You knew everybody in the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unsatisfied.
I'm sorry that happened like this.
I know Tom's not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom can do that without any help.
It's hot.
Tom told me she didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me if I like it.
Many old people can't stay with those days.
Tom hopes she wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he'd decide to do that.
It's a cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably not want to do that.
I'm sure you'll be successful.
Tom refused to accept the bribe.
Tom said that this wouldn't be a good idea.
I admit that I didn't do what Tom told me to do.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was sad.
Can't you wait this morning?
We're going to be in 15 minutes.
We know that willn't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his shield in a loud voice.
I think Tom is unrepentant.
I'm afraid I lost it.
Tom said she was probably a humiliation.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they were.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do this today.
Don't talk about business while we're eating.
I don't think I need to help Tom to do that.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was hard.
I hope Tom is adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She's got to be taken to the hospital.
I would help you if you asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
It's not a dry.
Tom should have done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all day afternoon.
I wonder if Tom's upset.
Tom said he knew that they would not let him do that at school.
Tom said she's hoping she likes to do that.
Tom would have done this for Mary if she had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom loved rices.
I know Tom's not planning to go to Boston with you.
Tom said she's not sure she's supposed to do that.
I didn't think Tom could talk to Mary about that.
Is that true that Tom and Mary planned to stay in Bosnia until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that for yourself.
Tom said that he thought it would be fun.
I think you'll find that Tom's fault.
I thought it was more crazy.
Do you know if Tom and Mary will do that?
What do you think Tom and Mary were those who did that?
Are you still planning to do this with Tom?
Tom said she didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know when you said you would be there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're murmuring.
You and I know that's not true.
Let's think that's going to happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that she thought she was truthful.
It's probably going to come Tom.
I'm sure Tom will come to Boston in this year.
I didn't think anybody tried this before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning.
Tom said it seemed like Mary was a hard time to do that.
I'm learning old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said she could do that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me that Mary was hard to get together.
They said they were too drunk.
You could have told me before.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was crazy.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know Tom doesn't do that anymore.
Tom says it's only when it's exactly necessary.
I don't think Tom's upstairs.
Tom was drunk and said what he shouldn't say.
Tom said she thought she was interested in the basketball.
Tom told me that she thought this book was interesting.
Tom thought everybody knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he planned to go on October 20th.
They said they're just doing good.
Hospitality resumed between two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone in his family did it.
I would have done it if I could.
I thought she wasn't planning to do that.
Tom thought everybody at school knew he was arrested.
Tom wanted to know how to make Mary happy.
Tom said she saw Mary doing that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said she thought she'd be able to do that.
I think Tom is the one who told Mary to do that.
Everybody knows Tom can't speak very well in French.
My finding suggests that this isn't the case.
Tom found the watch he lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it would be dangerous to do that.
Someone should have left the window open.
I know that Tom is a smart man.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know Tom Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just looking at the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offering a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he could do that in a few hours.
No doubt you'll be able to examine the examination.
Where's everyone?
How did you feel?
Fortune favors the courage.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still looking at me.
I thought Tom heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one's coming.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do this if they could find someone else to do it for them.
Tom said she was going home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have bought someone more qualified.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was depressed.
I'm wondering if Tom knows he's too busy.
Tom said she didn't know why she went to Australia.
Tom told me he was too tired to study.
Where's your cluggage?
My parents are musicians.
I live in Groingen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said she didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said she thought she could help her tomorrow.
I know Tom is chubby.
Will it be a cold day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom will be ready to talk to me.
Tom said she was happy Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that, Tom.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, more German.
Tom thought something was bad.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I know that it's very obvious that nobody knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said she went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I'm sure Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not likely that Tom will never admit that he's wrong.
Tom said he couldn't win.
Tom said he thought he shouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that soon.
There's a possibility that Tom doesn't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing as Mary did.
I know Tom is a sophomore.
Tom certainly knew he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me that she thought she was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said she knew that John shouldn't have to do that until Monday.
Tom shouldn't have tried to do this by himself.
How's your father?
My son is not a smell.
I would have let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said that it was harder than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said she doesn't think she wants to do that alone.
I wonder if it's really hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said she knew she couldn't have to do that again.
They swore that they willn't do that again.
I don't really plan to do that.
I know Tom will let you do that.
Tom said she would do that.
They said they wouldn't do that.
Tom thinks Mary wouldn't do that for John.
Tom said she thought she wanted to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like that.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary didn't do that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I was living in Australia.
Tom said she knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said she wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I want to.
Tom said she thought she was almost tired.
We ran out of two lines to reach the apparel statues.
I don't think Tom's funny.
Tom thinks he's gonna die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know, Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they'd be happy to help.
Tom and I want to go.
I didn't know you would tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I could do that for Tom.
Tom promised that he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should talk to Tom about this?
Tom told me that she thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me that she still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't smell the small things.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure that's gonna work?
I'm afraid I'm gonna beat it all day afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary that she thought she was wrong, but she didn't care what she thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first time off.
I promise you that willn't happen.
Tom said she thought she should do that.
Tom said he's never gonna try to do that again.
I don't think that's work.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom gave me a lot of things.
I know Tom is a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know Tom can't do that without any help.
Tom admitted that he lied to me.
Tom and Mary told John they're not planning to stay home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We don't know exactly what we're supposed to do.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he hopes you're trying to do it all you can.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what everyone else wanted to do.
Tom said she knew she could be allowed to do that tonight.
I don't think I know the guy who plays the drums.
This old man has a living spot on his skin.
Tom and Mary promised that they would never do that.
Give me that cheese.
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he was supposed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't know he had to leave.
They said they were afraid.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there's still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was shy.
Tom said he thought he was arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were scared.
I heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said she didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They live in a fantasy world.
They said that they thought I'm chasing.
I didn't know that Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have a lot of fun to do that.
I'm suspicious, Tom doesn't do that as often as he does.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I'm planning to go to lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him.
Tom told me that she thought she was afraid of Mary.
Tom already told me that he was determined to go to Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dead.
Tom offered me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea what Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they have taught French.
I'm suspecting Tom and Mary are interested.
Tom knows I don't need to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a head pain.
The bomb had been shifted just a minute before it was extinguished.
Tom and Mary told me they would win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear that!
Tom and Mary say they don't know French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said it's not the main reason why Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car, nor does Mary.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he wasn't different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been scared.
Who's asking me to give you this?
I'm just sick.
I hope I'll take a raise.
Tom said she didn't even think we should do that.
Tom said he would come if we called him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said she could cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't really think anyone was busy, Tom.
I think you know we have to do this today.
I didn't really think Tom would do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said she thought she understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone lives in this house for a long time.
Tom refused to steal the money.
Tom said she didn't decide what to do.
Everybody knew that Tom didn't want to go to Boston.
Tom said he thought it would be a sunrise tomorrow.
Tom is certainly drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
Everybody was there, except Tom.
I thought you promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they were fully restored.
I didn't know you weren't planning to do it yourself.
I don't think there's any way out here.
There's no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know John French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what to do, Mary.
Tom was probably ten years old at the time.
Tom and Mary said they were awful.
Tom said he couldn't help the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I'd be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me that she thought she was Mary.
So, where's the problem?
Tom didn't think she was beautiful.
He'll have to do that again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who could do that.
Only a new veg is selled here.
I believe this isn't a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was skenny.
I know Tom's angry.
I didn't meet anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I don't speak French.
I thought you'd be ready.
I know Tom knew why Mary didn't want to do that.
I didn't think that Tom was happy about what happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm now to tell you.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everybody here knows he's in Boston.
Tom refused to meet Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a Parliamentary republic in a mid-Europe and is part of nine Bundeslander.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they weren't yet almost almost thick.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that last day.
I thought Tom was already back.
Tom said she knew that she could not do that unless John did it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they liked.
Tom said Mary thought that John would need to do that.
Tom told me that she thought she wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was sweet.
Tom thinks she's not gonna do that for himself.
Tom said she thought she was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he'd pay everything.
They told me they weren't alone.
I don't think I can only finish the job.
Tom said she's not safe.
Tom said I've looked like the last time he saw me.
They said they'd see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was worried.
I'm afraid Tom willn't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what's going to do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperating.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary will be scared.
Tom and I are very proud of you.
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him.
We can't predict it, Tom, it's normal.
Tom's insulted.
Tom shouldn't have tried to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they would never do that.
I'm a talent than him.
Tom told me that she thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said she thought she would probably not want to do that today like this.
The teacher's room and the gym is under the renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you can do that?
Tom set up his glass.
You would think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we can't exist.
Tom, of course, understands that we all need to attend the meeting today.
Tom and Mary said they didn't agree to do that.
I know Tom is able to help us do that.
I had a dinner three hours ago.
Tom said she appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You're the only one who can protect them.
Can someone explain this to me?
Did you know Tom was going to be in Boston all weeks?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everybody knows that Tom and Mary are like each other.
I know Tom didn't know I wasn't gonna do that.
Tom said she thought she couldn't have to do it himself.
Tom has a lot to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There's no logical reason for this.
I suspected Tom was drunk.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed.
Tom said she didn't think she didn't like that.
They said they felt good.
I wish you didn't see me doing that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom shouldn't have done that.
Tom told Mary that she was one and only one.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was sure she didn't want to do that.
Tom said she knew what she was supposed to do.
I think you're awesome.
I wonder if Tom's gonna go to Boston next week.
Tom says she didn't know she wouldn't go to Australia unless she went with her.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not a stupid.
I think Tom doesn't win very often when he plays chess.
Tom said she didn't know Mary couldn't speak very well.
Tom said she knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said she wasn't mad.
I think we bought everything we needed.
Tom said she thought she couldn't have to do it himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom is average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said she knew she knew she should do it himself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watcher.
Tom and Mary said they were safe.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom looks like he doesn't want to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said she wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom is homesick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do this by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
I thought you said we wouldn't do that anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know who can do that.
I'm so sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you'd be the only person who would listen to me.
I know Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that.
Tom said she thought it would be awful thing to do Mary.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me that they were preoccupied.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would miss the train if he stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I'm so seriously sure that Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know I had to help Tom to do that.
No matter what you say, I'm sure I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any help anymore.
We can't change our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard that Tom was arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to be parked there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not going to kill Tom, are you?
They said they'd be willing to help us.
Tom told me that he would do it.
Tom is not the same as he was ten years ago.
I don't think there's any point to talk about this today.
I'm suspicious about that Tom doesn't tell Mary to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It's not always easy to distinguish right from wrong.
Tom said he's gonna try something he never did before.
I don't think Tom is strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I'm suspicious, Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prudent.
Tom said he would do that if he could.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said she wanted to kiss Mary good night.
If you do that, I'll be too.
I think Tom's incredible.
They told me that they were trying to do this.
I don't think I have everything I need.
That's not what Tom wanted you to do.
Which book did you give to Tom?
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last year.
Tom and Mary say they hope they can do that.
I know Tom expected me to do that.
I'm wondering if Tom had ever been into Boston.

I'd just talk to Tom instead of disrespecting him.

They said they'll do that soon.
I know the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
I can't believe you wanted to do that.
I have the impression that Tom's doing well.
Tom didn't know Mary was John's girlfriend.
They said they were very sick.

Tom said you're stupid.
Maybe the next time!
I think Tom's lying.
I know Tom knows I shouldn't do that.
I thought you could be in Australia for this week.
I'm sorry that I've made you wait so long today.
Tom thinks she's happy that's going to happen.
It's not until you're sick to see the value of good health.
I thought I broke my leg, but a X-ray showed me I didn't.
Tom said she didn't know Mary did that.
There's nothing we can do to help.
I don't think Tom understand what we wanted to do.
I don't know what it is.
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
I'm sure the police will be arrested, Tom.
I lived here for 20 years.
Tom told me he hated that.
Tom said he thought I was dead.

I don't think Tom likes your song.
I would have done it if I could.
They said they wouldn't try to do that.

Something's very wrong here.
I didn't know that Tom lived in the dormior.
I thought you'd want to see that.

I hope Tom's glad that's going to happen.

I don't think Tom's gonna be a problem anymore.
Didn't you know that Tom was Mary's brother?
I don't think I know that guy.
Tom said he planned to go on Monday.
I'm afraid I might be late.
I put my helmet on.
Tom was afraid that his parents would start asking him questions and that he would end up telling them everything.
I knew Tom could do that if he really needed it.
Tom think you're gonna be here tomorrow.
Everybody knows that Tom is lying.
Tom must have seen it.
Tom may be a treacherous.
I knew Tom would have agreed to do that.
They must have come home this time.
Tom told me that she's gonna talk to Mary about that.
I thought you wouldn't tell anyone.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's shoe is.
He'll do that if nobody stops him.
Put your guns down!
She's my first love.
In the summer, eggs soon go bad.
I taught my dog to sit down and pray.
I promise I don't tell anyone where he is.
Tom thought we shouldn't.

I thought you were Tom's friend.
They said they felt very lonely.

All the hope you're going to go in here.
I'll see if Tom is in his office.
Tom and Mary said they prefer red wine.
Tom and Mary may say they don't have to do this.
I hope you know the last thing I want to do is hurt you.
You're better than me.

Since my husband has become sick, he lost 20 kilograms and his pants are now a bag.
Tom never had a problem with anyone.
Tom would have eaten more if she had time.
I think I'd like that.
Tom said he thought he could do that on October 20th.
I know you're a good person.
Tom thought everybody at school knew he was arrested.
Tom said Mary doesn't think John would do that to Alice.
There is no doubt that I can't do it without your help.
I wish I didn't have to throw this off.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that.
Do you think Tom would want to go with us next weekend?
Should I answer in English?

I want you to know that I'm working so hard.

All we can do now is hoping that Tom does what he promises to do.
I didn't read it.

I didn't know you were planning to do that soon.
We should have done what you've been advised.
I thought you said you hated that.
Tom told me he wasn't an expert.
I know Tom wouldn't ask Mary not to do that.
Christmas is just around the cord.
Tom doesn't really want to do that.
Tom is the most smart person I ever met.
A man called you last night.
I'm a little drunk.
They're not hard as they look.
I think this is a right step.
I'll make sure that Tom does it someday today.
Tom fell in love with Mary the first time he saw her.
I didn't understand anything you said.
You should have left when you had the chance.

If I had done my best, I could have succeeded.
I know Tom and Mary's done that.
Tom would have done that if you asked him.
I know Tom is a lot of smart joke than Mary.
How much did you spend each day in Australia?
I hope I can do that.
I mean, when I said I wanted to marry you.
I don't think anyone was satisfied.
It looks like someone rips a page out of this book.
I knew Tom didn't know you were the one who did that.
I don't think there's time to talk to you now.
I think you shouldn't have done this for yourself.
He's a man who's doing things.
I hope you'll be my friends.

And when she came to the place where the footwear walked through the molten, she found a little waters of water, and a lot of murmur, so she threw the bread into the bucket, and thrust it over it, that she might slip her legs without wearing it.
