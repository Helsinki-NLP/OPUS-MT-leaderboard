It's a big responsibility.
It's a cool house.
It's anguish for America to lose our young men and women.
It's a cat.
It's a thrilling city, New York.
It's a feeling you can't walk with us.
It's a feeling you can't join us.
It's a privilege to meet you.
It's better to take your time quickly and make mistakes.
It's obvious that she's home.
It's Friday.
It's getting bigger.
It's getting dark out there.
It's dark outside.
It's good you don't have to study so hard.
It's amazing.
It's never late to learn.
It's not always easy to distinguish right from wrong.
It's not a watcher.
It's not easy to speak English.
It's not particularly hot today.
It's not raining.
It's not until you're sick to see the value of good health.
It's not until you lose your health.
It's not a bug.
It's not always easy to face reality.
It's not as hard as it sounds.
It's not clear who wrote this letter.
It's not easy, but we'll do it anyway.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
It's not easy for everyone to understand.
It's not far away from the hotel.
It's not for starters.
It's not gonna hurt.
It's not good to scoff at people in public.
It's not hard.
It's not just my problem.
It's not likely that Tom will never admit that he's wrong.
It's not like Tom's going anywhere.
It's not fun to do that.
I don't need to do that.
Tom doesn't have to do that for himself.
We don't need to attend this talk.
We don't need to make a decision now.
It's not necessary for you to be here any longer.
It's not possible to change the past.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
It's not rational.
It's not really important.
It's not socially acceptable to people.
It's not something I can miss.
It's not Tom's idea, it's mine.
It's not likely that Tom wants to do that.
It's not working.
It's not working yet.
It's not worth reproducing this camera.
It's not worth it.
It's said he knows the secret.
It's still moving.
It's Sunday.
It's amazing that they should have a second house in America.
It's time for you to go to bed.
It's too late for him.
It's too late for you.
It's true that I am a steep teacher.
It's true that the earth is around.
It's very kind of you to show me the way.
It's very useful.
It'll be hard to find out what caused the problem.
It'll be done by the time you come here.
It'll be hard for Tom to do that.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
It'll be impossible to do that.
It will not take less than one hour to go there.
It looks like it's going to rain.
It looks like Tom and Mary want to do that.
It looks like someone rips a page out of this book.
It looks like Tom is waiting for someone.
That makes sense.
It's not hard to do this as you think it's going to be.
It might be good to do that.
It's not hard to do as you think it's going to be.
It's not too difficult to do that.
It must have been a shock for you.
It must have been broken during the ship.
It must have been hard for Tom to do that.
It must have been expensive.
I told Tom I was from Australia.

It rained for three days.
I tried to convince Tom that, but he said he wasn't interested.
I tried to do all I could to stop Tom.
I tried to kill myself twice.
I tried to convince Tom to come to Australia with us, but he said there were other things he had to do.
I trusted someone who didn't deserve my trust.
It's 2:30.
It's a bargain.
It's a beautiful day!
It's about time you're here!
It's a complete disaster.
It's a dead poison!
That's a good thing Tom did.
That's a good thing, Tom left the door open.
It's gonna be all right.
It's always a birthday.
It's a miracle!
It's a miracle that our house survived the earthquake.
It's a miracle that Tom survived the accident.
It's a miracle, Tom survived that accident.
It's a feeling that we didn't visit Tom when we had a chance.
It's a secret, so please don't tell anyone.
It's shame you can't go with us.
It's too hard for me to walk far away.
It's been years since we met the last time.
It's been a long time since I told you I love you.
It's decided.
It's done before.
It's out of me.
It's hard to love someone, whether it's not clear, or not the other person loves you in the same way.
It's hard to love someone, whether it's not clear, or not the other person loves you in the same way.
It's hard to love someone, whether it's not clear, or not the other person loves you in the same way.
It's hard to love someone, whether it's not clear, or not the other person loves you in the same way.
It's hard to love someone, whether it's not clear, or not the other person loves you in the same way.
It's hard to love someone, whether it's not clear, or not the other person likes you.
It seemed that there was no one in the village.
It looks like Tom and Mary like doing this together.
It looks like Tom likes everyone.
It seems he's gonna have to work more hard.
Looks like Tom and Mary are classical music.
It seems that Tom wants to be a teacher.
Looks like you don't have a good time here.
It looks like nobody's home.
It seems there's no one inside.
Looks like I've seen the man on the side where he's wearing somewhere before.
It's enough to drive you mad!
It's gonna be hard to do.
It's gonna be hard to find someone else to replace Tom.
It'll be easy to find someone to rent this house.
It's gonna be hard to do that now.
It's gonna be hard to find someone else to replace Tom.
That's good, Tom didn't do that yet.
It's hard to believe that Tom is only ten years old.
It's hard to get a rape with your bar hands.
It's hard to do this, isn't it?
It's hot.
It should have been easy to do.
It's important that we do it right.
It's impossible to do that.
It's just gone a twenty-old.
It's amazing.
It's smelling like someone smoking here.
It's far more than we hoped.
It's nearly the same!
It's not a bad plan.
It's not a big deal.
It's not about them.
It's not a cat, it's a dog.
It's not a computer problem.
It's not a hard question.
It's not a good idea to ask a woman how old she is.

It's not all that stupid.
It's not always easy to tell you the difference between good and bad.

It's not easy to find work today.
It's not enough to know only one language.
It's not the evening.
It's not fair.
It's not fair.
It's not done yet.
It's not going to be as hard as you think it will be.
It's not easy for you to do this.
It's not easy to find someone to rent this house.
It's not gonna end well.
It'll never happen anymore.
It's not gonna work.
It's not good for anybody.
It's not hard to guess what's going on.
It's not good to eat and run.
It's not health to break food.
It's not how much you know, but what you can do to count it.
It's not just a small problem.
It's not just Tom's fault.
It's not just Tom's problem.
It's not like I don't want to do it.
It's not like that.
It's not like I was trying to avoid Tom.
It's not likely that Tom will never admit that he's wrong.
It's not likely that Tom will never admit that he's wrong.
It's not easy as you think it's going to be.
It's not likely to rain tomorrow.
It's not like we do anything.
It's not like we're gonna get married or something.
It's not like you have nothing to do.
It's not like you know what they're gonna do.
It's not my business.
It's not nice to hit people.
It's not good to smoking here.
It's not open for the dispute.
It's not until the fat lady sings.
It's not possible.
It's not over.
It's not really safe for you to drink from my glass.
It's not reasonable.
It's not rocket science.
It's not safe to drink this water.
It's not safe to get out of the dark after yourself.
It's not safe for text while you drive.
It's not safe.
It's not snowing.
It's not anybody can do.
It's not anybody's ashamed of it.
It's not something I'm so good.
It's not something I think I can do.

It's not something I want to talk about.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
It's not something I'm proud of.
It's not something I'm so good.
It's not something I think I can do.

It's not a long flight.
It's not strange, isn't it?
It's not the last goal, but the process of taking it there.
It's not Tom who needs protection, Mary.
It's not too expensive.
It's not too hard.
It's not too late to call Tom now.
It's not too late to change the schedule.
It's not too late to turn back.
It's not true that Tom died in the hospital, she died at home.
It's not urgent.
It's not likely to rain tomorrow.
It's not so cold today.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you say, but how you say it.
It's not worth mentioning.
It's not worth much.
It's not worth the effort.
It's not wrong.
It's not you, it's me!
It is obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
It's obvious, Tom can't do that without any help.
It's obvious, Tom's angry.
It's obvious that Tom wasn't used to live on a twenty budget.
It's obvious, Tom is waiting for someone.
It's obvious, Tom wants to do that.
It's okay.
It's OK to be crazy in someone who hurts you.
It's OK to lie to the authorities.
It sounds like someone's crying.
It's possible.
It's possible that Tom came here when he was a boy.
It's possible that Tom came here when he was a young man.
It's possible, Tom mayn't know I'm here.
It'll probably be hard for Tom to win.
It's probably going to come Tom.
It's raining cats and dogs.
It's raining, it's nice for weeks.
It's really hot this summer!
It's not really important.
It's not really important.
It's upset that Tom and Mary broke up.
It's amazing that you didn't hear anything from Tom.
It's surprised you haven't heard anything about what happens.
That's what Tom would do.
It's time to think about your past.
It's time to wash that funny, Tom.
It's Tom Mary wants to see.
It's Tom Mary wants to talk to her.
It's Tom's twenty birthday tomorrow.
It's so bad you didn't take my advice.
It's completely dark outside.
It's unfortunate.
It's infinitely Tom will do that.
It's infinitely Tom will do that.
It's unnecessary.
It's usually easy for Norwegians to get what Sweden says.
It's so cold, but it's not cold.
That's the way Tom promised he would be here.
That's what Tom wanted.
It's your fault I'm crazy.
It took more than I expected.
I turned off my computer.
I turned the lights off.
I turned the computer off.
From the beginning, it was a terrorist attack.
It was clear that Tom didn't really know that he didn't really need to do that.

It wasn't hard to find a pair of shoes.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to do that.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to sing.
It's obvious that Tom was disappointed.
It was snowing the day I was born.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
It was an unbelievable attack.
It'll be a hot day.
It's going to be annoying soon or later.
It'll be easier later.
It won't stay like that.
It won't stay this way.
It'll destroy us all.
It is easier for the people, if they are called by the people's judicial authority.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to the taxi station.
It's not hard for us to do this.
It won't be so hard to do that.
It would be fun.
It would be impossible.
It would be better if you didn't go there.
It would be fun to do that.
It would have been hard to do that.
It would be interesting to do that.
It would be romantic to do that.
It would have been tired to do that.
It would be wise to do that.
It would be wrong to do that.
I understand nobody wants to help us.
I used to think you were cool.
I usually wash my clothes in a launderette.
I lost the pen I bought last day.
I've already met everybody.
I already promised Tom I would help him.
I've already said I'll do that.
I already told Tom I don't want to do that.
I already told Tom I should do that.
I already told Tom that I'm not planning to do that.
I'm going to Australia every Sunday since I was ten years old.
I was waiting for it!
I've been planning to do that for months.
I was told that you're a good carpenter.
I was told that you're a good French speaker.
I was told you were looking for a babyster.
I was told you were looking for a career.
I'm told you you're looking for a seat.
I've never decided to do that again.
I did everything I was asked to do.
I did everything you asked me to do.
I've done so many times.
I did that more than anybody else.
I like to talk to you.
I have nothing to write about.
I have to do something with these rashes.
I heard that shopping is fun.
I heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
I heard that Tom left Mary.
I heard that women spend more shoes than men.
I heard you're sure.
I heard women spend more shoes than men.
I'm just sick.
I lost three kilos.
I made some coffee for us.
I've never been to Paris.
I never fell into love with anyone.
I never heard Tom cry on anybody.
I never met anyone like you before.
I never saw anyone hit Tom.
I parked my car here so many times, and nobody complained.

I promised Tom I'd go to Australia with him.
I want to love you forever!

I was afraid I could be late for the bus.
I was afraid I could be recognized.
I was afraid that Tom would kill me.
I was a stupid to Tom money.
I was sure I shouldn't do that.
I was forced to do some things I didn't want to do.
I was happy to see Tom.
I was hoping that was a joke.
I hoped you and I could get together this afternoon.
I was just about to call you, but you hit me.

I was surprised when Tom said he wouldn't do that.
I was living in Boston when I was eight.
I didn't feel hungry.
I wasn't able to play tennis last year as I wanted to.
I wasn't as helpful as I should.
I wasn't hungry like Tom.
I wasn't as successful as Tom.
