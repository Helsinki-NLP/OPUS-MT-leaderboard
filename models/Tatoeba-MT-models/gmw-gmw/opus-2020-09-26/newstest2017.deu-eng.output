28-year-old cook found in San Francisco Mall dead
A 28-year-old cook, recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping center.
The victim's brother said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm him, "Finally, he went up again."
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the judicial medical department in San Francisco.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations were running.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who worked earlier as a cook in Boston, had gathered his dream job as a cook in the Sons & Daughter restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman of Sons & Daughter said that they were "shocked and destroyed on the ground over his death".
"We're a small team that works like a close family and we'll miss him painfully," the speaker continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends in this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank lived in hostels first, but that "the things finally went up for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a friend," Louis Garcia KGO told.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a friendly man with a great heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something to prepare for dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swimed with the current.
"In all that goes wrong in the world, he was this unslucky diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Any person having information on the case shall be asked to call the SFPD notify telephone under number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I am always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
This has made the Hollywood star clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or get stuck up from outside labels that usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I don't want to be perfect and successful myself."
"Of course, these things are rather cute to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about it being considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, forming television with loose dut and mexican food, says the magazine.
To the white gloss, they ask the child's wish: "We do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," says Hollywood Star.
In her new film "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game" Aniston can be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film runs with us from August 25th.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experiences on the horse are overviewable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a little change with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.
CHIO: "Golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday evening, hunting home in the quick galopp to the food drums.
A kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.
"It wasn't a good experience," says Langer.
And then the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany was the best golfer ever - 101 tournament - again close to horses.
He and his family were led over the installation of the ALRV, he did not even push himself on a horse for photography purposes.
Longer was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid transmitted the golden sports pyramid to the man from Anhausen within a small gala.
There is no lack of award for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has already assassinated him.
Longer is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is forgiven not only for sporting successes but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has promoted the childhood.
And so he also passed on the price money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-fold U.S. master won the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the outstanding are the light athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the tournament Eberhard Gienger, the feathers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-Fahrer Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the spring rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the handballer Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrative society moved to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer held distance to the large animals.
Clintons and Trumps Economic Policy Compared: It's all about the money
Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that's both Clinton and Trump.
However, the two US presidency candidates are in the field of tax and energy policy as well as a principle issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep these in doubt rather small and warns about how the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate to death, he says.
He himself would be quite different, claiming Trump.
It will reverse regulations, and it will make itself strong for a wide-ranging tax reform with lower tax rates - for private and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says that the State has certain tasks to be fulfilled, he has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for it.
That's why the taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton have to be invested in almost equal words.
The democratic candidate announces even the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.
State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policy and are strictly rejected by the Republicans' state-critical teaparty flights.
So Trump could still have internal discussions.
More clearly, the differences in energy and climate policy are.
Trump wants to build coal power plants and drive coal promotion in the USA again.
Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas, and the Paris Climate Protection Agreement will be announced.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energies with its investment programme and demands: "A country will be the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
However, not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other.
TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, does not want to sign both.
At the same time, however, the USA do not want to isolate from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.
They should be better paid, for example, Clinton.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.
What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage must be upward, then he says he cannot be changed.
However, the large discussion over the coming months is likely to develop more on the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics hold him up, so the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every fleeing woman has experiences with sexual violence"
Sexual violence belongs almost to everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everybody has a baby that is at least one year old.
One put her little son in his arm.
He looks curious in the room with big eyes.
His mother's staring on the tableboard.
Until she notices she's being observed.
She smiles shortly and kisses the little one.
The scene looks normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier of social assistance in Bavaria, and is concerned with, among other things, women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-inflated women and their children in Bavaria.
In January Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's help.
She was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - even as a visitor.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is not too exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence on her escape," says Bahr.
"Mans flee for wars because they are politically persecuted because they are threatening torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a maker of hope," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape prevail: "Many steal secretly from it because they don't see any other way out."
In their homeland, they have made experience with sexual violence, compulsion, honor murder, slavery, or forced prostitution.
That's what she's doing.
It's on the run.
"That slepper demands for, for example, a bottle of water sexual action is not a rare thing," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that this ends as soon as they arrive in Germany, wrong, Bahr tells.
Here too, single women in refugees would often be considered to be inferior and badly abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of the women living in the accommodation in Munich North are traumatized, it estimates.
"Some of the children have certainly not been voluntary."
Many women are so customary that they don't say anything.
"Or they do not trust to speak openly about the experienced, because the shame is too great."
Since they often do not know how to help, it needs more accommodation only for them, Bahr asks.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.
To the question whether they knew of a project similar to that in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no.
There is no such thing in government accommodations in the upper palm and upper francs, for example.
Even in Schwaben alone, refugee women are not separately housed, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, government press speaker.
In Upper Bavaria, under- and medium-sized francs, there are floors or own houses in some Community units only for single women and their children.
The exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Rights of the Women and Equality of Genders in the European Parliament also calls for women to be separated from men.
A study published for the Committee states: "It is very important for men and women to be kept separately."
"If the privacy is confused or men and women are housed together, violence against women can occur - continuing."
In particular, laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, the study states.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be shown at Andrang, which is available on the house in Munich.
"Since we've spoken around, we've got a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strikes: Requirements for new labour struggle measures
Deputy assistant doctors have called on their trade union to approve new work struggles in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has requested its entire Council to approve more work struggles from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that it would have failed Ministers to address the concerns of the Treaty.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA in July.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would be "persistently quiet" to problems, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In the light of this, the JDC Board voted to completely reject the proposed new treaty and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Board has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating work struggles that begins at the beginning of September.
The disputes led to the sixth strike of assistant doctors this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA assistant doctor Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.
He informed members of BMA during the meetings held before the vote by 54,000 assistants and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and adopted.
After the vote, the Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the treaty for doctors in England would be forced to be introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of outsiders?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterplayer in the golden hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot prevent the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smiles seemed smiley and he hardly shone warmth, even for his restraint conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his "love friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have felt that there was never anything bad.
It seemed to me that his enthusiasm pointed to the opposite.
But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable cooling showed that Russia's head hadn't forgotten anything.
Instead, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduction words: the cessation of a Russian fighter on the Syrian border through Turkey.
Moscow's reaction at the time was burned.
Putin distributed and accused Ankara of having fallen Russia into his back.
The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the trust will be difficult, if not even impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
At once, it seemed as if the Turks were to be blamed for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations of senior officials were that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trade in Syrian territories controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He argued about this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia could book a kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
Erdogan needs primarily all the friends he can get after he was exposed last month in a failed state war nearly his office.
It was also shocked by repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists every year to the Turkish coast.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.
They count on a late seasonal storm to the Mediterranean.
This week the state television forecasts cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows: "Tourists there for long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West, as it considers its reaction to the attempted acquisition as a weak answer.
The persistent resentment of EU accession negotiations and Putin, which is proud to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian Head of State certainly won a bonus in Ankara for requesting support for the elected state bodies after the attempted war.
For Moscow this is a natural thing that has a deep fear of regime change.
The summit in this glamorous palace at the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present one, as described by an analytical one, "alliance of outsiders": two countries who feel breached from the west and feel badly treated and now joined themselves.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents at the press conference said that they had not even addressed the topic.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided an answer to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey was firing the Russian fighting jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak again at least.
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
According to the CEO of the Bank, the brand RBS is to be reduced only to a Backoffice roll.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed the BBC Scotland that the brand RBS was connected with the bank's global ambitions.
Since then, the bank has been dismantling when it almost collapsed and had to be saved eight years ago.
At this time, trademark strategists "RBS" used to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange notation will change to NatWest.
Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for the private business that will be more important - Couts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a visiting tour by customers and employees in Inverness-shire.
He told the BBC Scotland: "The brand RSB will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed, as we are now becoming a bank of brands."
When the bank became a global brand itself, RBS became a global brand.
I now say that we are not pursuing global goals but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in its own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop to the bank of brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see many changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori at Predilection achieved its 3,000th gain at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th gain
The Jockey Frankie Dettori secured its 3,000th British profit at Newmarket on Friday.
He set on predilection, trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Jockey, who reaches the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayar before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes the jubilee as he takes the victory on predilection
Two Jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jockey Richard Johnson and the retired 20-fold winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who reached more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4.493 career victory
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it's his tactical intellect, which distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have been enthusiastic to fans for years for this sport.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago to Epsom that he had already earned 6,000 profits if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already rided winners in GB for nearly 30 years, which is great.
He has a living personality, which is good for a British race, but he is also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the pendulum of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nervous.
A number of big tournament wins, including its famous "Gloren Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lock, but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to oppose and return to his best form.
And he's not a long time at the end - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his at least 50th anniversary.
Russia's Putin Fires Stab Chief Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly released his staff chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of the closest trust circle of Putin for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In an opinion from the Kremlin it is that Putin, without giving reasons, has ordered "the release of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration".
Anton Vaino, who has been the alternate of Ivanov since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital of Tallinn, he concluded at the renowned Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin website, it is said (in Russian) that he was later head of the government and head of staff.
About his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as Head of State on drafting laws and controls for the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smile faces convince?
This step made Moscow mysteriously.
Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest trusted Vladimir Putins and works as he works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As a staff leader, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
During a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the staff was resigning on their own request.
But despite the smile for the camera, only a few are convinced of this - especially now, just before Parliament's elections.
So is this the consequence of a kind of force struggle?
Nobody currently knows that.
But the official claim - that a man who was once praised as a potential president - once wanted to lead Russian environmental policy - was very skeptical.
In his comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 to trust me this very complicated post - one could almost say - difficult posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidency for four years and eight months.
Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.
Previously he was deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his alternate.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term of office, since a third period of office of Putin would have violated the Constitution.
But this post was taken by another, close-up ally, Putins, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before three and a half years later he became President.
Criminal Minds Star Thomas Gibson fired after he hit producers
Gibson was involved in a physical conflict last month in the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his termination in a joint opinion.
Gibson, who played the Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday before the announcement of his termination.
On the set there were artistic differences and differences in opinion.
I regret the incident," he said in a communication.
Detailed information on how the character Gibsons from the series, followed by a team of FBI agents, is expected to be published at a later time, according to the opinion of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old who played in the Sitcom Dharma & Greg was involved since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put in my whole heart blood for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a release published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but this will no longer be possible.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series.
The planned exploration of the twelfth season will take place on 28 September.
Puzzles about fish landing in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spyed out by a spring fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed until May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern deck of the Queensferry Crossings to the Viadukt - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blade", which approach the completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 ropes.
The £ 1.35 billion expensive project is to be completed until May 2017.
Minister of Economics Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering of a truly epic dimension in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the Viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for passing.
Altogether, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in their place and the last section of the deck today in Rosyth gets a concrete cast for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first closure is a significant milestone for each bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents future high and low construction.
After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower deck in the expansion, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north side or the countryside.
This was achieved by drawing the northern supply bridge 700 millimeter south.
This was a massive and at the same time very sensitive activity.
Since the Viadukt is 222 meters long, approximately 6,000 tons weighed and had to be pulled up at an elevation of about 3%.
Hekel, since the tolerances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything was very good.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have "luck to be alive"
Three men have "happy to be alive", after being thrown by their fishing boat before Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI Rescue Station struck alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew observed the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulties to swim in safety, while their boat continued on their own.
"We saw the boat turning around near them and imagined the worst," said Moelfre Vince Jones's Head of Rescue Station.
"Happyly, the strong winds have weighed the boat out of its reach until we left to water," he added.
Two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a Boje hanging without a rescue vest.
They all came on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
Mr. Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water have happiness without injuries and still to be alive.
Although the boat engine had an emergency stop line, the boat dissolved from the person who controlled the boat when the boat turned down.
Someone watched over these men today.
Heavy injured - man stirs on his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and severely injured.
As the police reported yesterday, the 50-year-old had got the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized perpetrators cut off the clothing of his ex-girlfriend.
When this one came to the apartment, he knocked on her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured on the hand and on the body.
The police could arrest the offender.
While the 50-year-old destroyed the clothing of his ex-girlfriend, he called his mother.
This alarmed his sister.
Together with her companion, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she couldn't move him to leave the apartment.
That's why she went out of the house with her lifemate.
On the street they met the ex-life companion of the man.
When the two women once again entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
SPD and Green say that investors should be much more involved in the obligation in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "Handling concept of living" at the next Council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First of all, the question is: Who should actually build the favourable apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
SPD Group Chairman Christoph Bratmann says: "We agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to prove 20 percent of all apartments as social dwellings."
However, the favourable apartments can also be created in stock.
However, the major issue in the town hall is, according to Bratmann, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent of the apartments in such areas, but as much as 20 percent of them as social dwellings."
A new urban housing support programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, says Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as little rules as possible.
The left still wants hard conditions for investors.
Nevertheless, Bratmann said that the situation in the housing market was intensified.
If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction management.
More personnel are required.
It's unclear whether we'll get the professionals.
However, the program is not entirely available: for the around 1260 new apartments that should be built anyway.
How, however, is the loss of more than 1300 favourable apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?
It will be 500 apartments until 2020 alone.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokesman Nicole Palm, the city should now purchase outgoing bonds.
In addition, it is necessary to consider returning apartments to price commitment.
This is possible in the West City.
The problem could be solved at one time.
Because in the West City, the end of the year expires.
Approximately 1800 apartments could be brought back to the price commitment for cheap apartments.
Only: That's not what the owners want, the housing companies.
Because the number of social housings in the West Town is increased dramatically, they are removed from the aim of the so-called blend.
A concentration of social weaknesses in just a few parts of the city is no longer required.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, chairman of the group, said: "For a wide majority, the CDU must go to the boat."
Although it concentrated on more buildings for single family houses.
But what does not mean that there is no compromise yet.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and child to play no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens has been complained by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then limited to video games and lastly to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and activities in the outside do not exclude each other.
I am of course referring to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters first created for the 1990s video games (later produced a drawing series, game cards and other spin-offs).
How many phenomena of pop culture decreased the interest before publishing the game in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Marketing in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than tiger and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go out with their smartphones and search for Pokémons, who are tracked with a GPS and, once they have been found, can be "photoized" (via a screenshot on the phone) or " captured".
A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the wahn and jumped for the search of the sofa.
In the United States, the game led to a significant increase in steps that the "average" person deducts every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently informed the Washington Post that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of tracked people who train 30 minutes each day rose from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who of them plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for increasing performance.
Many public information campaigns on health that people want to "take 30 minutes of time", "to come from the sofa" and "to be active every day" stuck on dove ears, because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable.
Nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overevaluated.
Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to indicate them here.
But the wonderful to Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunlight as well as fun.
Some people even close new friendships on hunting.
As always, there are marauder games that always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What are you doing?
It happened a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were already able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise sports as this game does.
The new will lose its stimulus and the use will be delayed in time.
Because of Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with activation in the real world, helping many people hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's tours
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Unfortunately on the bar.
Breatheing on the ground.
On the whole line brilliant.
And now, too, Olympia.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American tournament climbed into the multi-kampf title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the light of the Olympic Games.
Her overall result of 62,198 was clearly before the silver medal winner and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.
The Americans, Simone Biles, turn on the sweat bar during the single multi-compliance of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-kampf title and totally the fifth, while she firms her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.
She broke out in tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at this moment.
This success sets them into the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sports in the last three years, 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambitions and precision that the 1984 Olympician Mary Lou Retton said of her that she "is the best tournament I've ever seen."
She expected a final examination in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of overdimensioned expectations.
Not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embraced each after they won the gold and silver in the single multi-compliance of women at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as a provocation mark at the retirement celebration of the team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles was on the top of her long way, never planned for the future, this is not really true.
Some of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - are tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic Islands in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by Trainerin Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the Turnhalle in which Boorman trained.
Since summer 2013, she has no longer lost a multi-competition, a victory series that will continue as long as it wants Biles.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two rotations, the image was deceived.
Swimming bars and floor towers - where Biles kept the world champion title - laughed.
She reappeared with 15,433 on the sweat bar - and put one on the floor with a 15,933.
Raisman gently embraced her when they expected her endurance - a pure formality - and tears flowed on biles shining red, white and blue eyeliner, when the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiembreak.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain called "Oma" had a lead.
After her soil exercise, she threw up to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes appeared doubtless.
As for Biles, the rapidly spreading Tweet of the 19-year-olds from the beginning of this week has a completely new significance:
Police: 3 victims shot in the case of serial murder when listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who had died in one of the most fatal attacks for a decade in the first serial murder case of Phoenix, while they were talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in an entrance, the authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, can be read in the report.
The police noted that the three-fold murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery because the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were owned by one of the adult victims.
The police speaker of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that shooting led the investigators to become a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks.
Overall, seven people were killed and two more injured in hisopathic areas within four months in nine attacks.
"It happens in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard of the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.
It is assumed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized and later died because of her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on site.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for her to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which aimed at an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the three-fold murder and that it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.
Inventors found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephalia: "It's getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the least of his adolescents Edmund microcephalia, the result of a genetic disturbance, his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't leave myself on that.
What isn't right at all -- of course you've been able to do that," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far that they suggested institutionalizing him.
"My first answer was 'I didn't know that people still do," said Picciuto.
Edmund can run with a help.
Edmund couldn't sit or crab until his third year of life, and he still cannot speak.
But he's slowly making progress.
He can run with support and cycling.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund for "Please sing for me."
"We teach him sign language," said Picciuto CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephalia has a wide range of causes: genetics such as Edmund and viruses such as maize or cinnamon virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary considerably.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I constantly asked what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I don't expect her to really tell me someone.
But Picciuto has a hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zika virus.
It's gonna be better.
You know it'll be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescue in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday. It is counted all Saturday with more rainfall.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisianas and the south of Mississippi flooded their banks and threatened with large floods of extreme rainfall, reported the National Weather Service.
The governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards informed that government officials were in constant contact with the local authorities and were already on the way to help the municipalities concerned.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, informed that the demands for flooding vessels, boats and sand bags were multiplied.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandpacks.
A flood warning system is used over large parts in South Louisianas until Saturday.
The weather service made it clear that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall.
In the south of Alabama, a flood warning system was used on Friday, while it continued to rain in the mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, which are both located in Louisiana, will likely reach record levels after the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a flow downwards overflow in Ascension Parish is a danger, as they will only flow slowly over the flows of the flowed rivers into Lake Maurepas.
The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, already reached the highest stand ever recorded on Friday.
Rescue teams still sprinkled people from the flooding water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house, rose strongly overnight.
He said that another stepson living nearby had warned him.
"We wake up and the water flowed and flowed into it," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife said Hansford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that all three emergency workers had saved in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire guard in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had been "swiftly spread" because there were still severe rainfalles and that the authorities would like evacuation instructions to consider.
According to Krautmann, a observer near Livingstone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches rain.
Krautmann said that since Wednesday the soil has been much full of rain.
The authorities indicated that severe rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and teaching failure in five school districts.
The CBS daughter sender WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa gave 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of whom were now flooded.
The chief of the municipality of Robby Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets spoiled by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency accommodations were set up to host the evacuated.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," he said.
In the city of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandpacks provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their houses and shops.
"The last great flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said that it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to its information, a handful of houses were reported as overflown on Thursday, but not yet been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "through bullets", survived shooting in Philadelphia
The police tell that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time a 6-year-old child will be shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents indicated that Brown suffered several shot injuries, including in the lungs, legs, arms and belly, but that he was at consciousness during his transport to the hospital.
"He has endured a lot, his small body was hollowed by balls," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the transmitter.
I just can't believe that.
The boy's condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy's family told the transmitter that he was expected to cure again.
He should have started the first class in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are, according to CBS Philadelphia, in a stable state.
The boy was found at the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in a critical condition, the transmitter reports.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police were sure that they could be among one of the injured men of the offenders.
Inventors told CBS Philadelphia that there seemed to have been a crossfire between several shots.
Carton shells for storm weapons traced to various storm weapons crossed the crime site.
It seems that this was clearly a lasting fight.
On the road, on both sides of the walkway, were Hülsen.
So there seem to have been here several armed fighters who were very actively involved," told police captain Anthony Ginaldi to the police in Philadelphia to the station.
Several houses and vehicles were also met in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are currently checking reports according to the surveillance video.
On Tuesday another 6-year-old girl was hit by a cross hit on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine among the women's Olimpia team in turning and that for more than one reason.
First, since 1984, I have been with every summer olympiade and the USA have never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three actresses, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colors.
The structure of this team, which is Aly Raisman, the Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the US.
It has strengthened the black and hisanic female presence at the top of this sport.
In the last four years, the number one among the female turners was an Afro American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America was exclaimed.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but mastery gymastics routines.
On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold in an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We're experiencing the top of this sport, but that's how we don't look like turning classes throughout the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four team tournaments. This is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer.
But the reality looks like turning is a expensive sport and tournaments primarily in private tour clubs that are maintained by parents who come up for training, facilities, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their tournaments and families). The list can be continued.
The majority of these teams are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these associations the tournaments receive their entire training and this is a expensive and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, Trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, Trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started turning.
We must also allow countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to take more leisure and easy to access.
I founded my 20-year turning foundation.
At my events, we have offered free and affordable tours in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youths (especially black and historic) and trained national and international winners.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high quality tours that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Turning develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and certainty for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to be interested in turning and that is great.
It is so important to take part in sports, especially for girls.
That's so exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic Team Gold and thanking you, so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to begin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the functioners of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in a election rejected it.
In July Hunt had revealed plans to forcefully introduce the contract and said that the NHS was in a "Neaman country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend work to improve care at ingastic times.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistant Doctors, announced last night in a communication: "Assistant doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heated the current employment crisis and abstain from treating all doctors fairly."
For only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new treaty, progress must be made and time is over.
The BMA's efforts to resolve the disputes through discussions were opposed to the government’s participation and sometimes to the silence of horror.
This happened to the promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt has to act now, raise the forcement and address the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work struggles.
The last strike at the end of April saw a cessation of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 dates, as nurses and specialists were included in order to provide doctors with coverage on the strike post chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute about the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the functioners of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend wage for the 54,000 assistant doctors subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctor to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Working fighting does not achieve anything of the only little, but already overloaded teams and service providers and only cause concerns, emergency and interruption to patients, nurses and their families."
In the last two months, we have spoken to the committee of assistants and responded positively to the concerns about the premature and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as dispatch, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional expiry, training boxes, mutual recognition of the curriculum, education leave and gender-specific wage losses in medicine - was an indication of how serious it was for the employers, health education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with BMA agreements in November, February and May.
The £2 per day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £2 per day medication after the authorities recommended that this more people be given for a longer period of time.
The inhibitor Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attack for people with heart disease.
Medicine is administered 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS Regulator NICE recommended a four-year take in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS Regulator NICE recommended a four-year take in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or a stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by collections of fatty materials in the artery walls that form covers.
If the plaster breaks apart, it can cause a blood crush that blocks the blood flow up to the heart and thus causes a heart attack.
If the blood clot is dissolved, it can flow through the bloodstream and hide the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is produced by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.
The draft instruction of NICE, which has been published today, recommends a 12-month dose of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily aspirin intake for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Although the availability of secondary prevention has a quarter of those who have suffered a heart attack, another heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By a provisional recommendation by Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness makes election fraud bloom in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year on the occasion of a government report for corruption
A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread election fraud in Muslim communities knowingly ignored as a devastating government report revealed today.
The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles in general attacks police, election observers and councils to have ignored evidence of choosing abuse due to "oversensitivity with regard to ethnicity and religion".
The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, now an anticorruption king, said that intimidation of electors for religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up lockers outside election cabins in order to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters carry out an identification to prove their identity in elections.
At present, a voter only has to name his name and address.
The report proposes to apply non-removable ink on the finger of a person if they give their vote to prevent someone from selecting twice.
Whistleblower should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
It calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.
"That is not only against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet's election scandal in the east of London.
Last year, a special election court decided that the official mayor Lutfur Rahman should be exposed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.
The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cyan way" and that he would have silent his critics with Rassissmus and Islamophobia accusations.
Rahman "has led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of a imitation in which one person is chosen as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent choice of letters - where older members of the Muslim community had pressured people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, educated, made several recommendations to clean up the election system, including conducting evidence to prove the identity
His report states: "As evidence it was appropriate that pressure was exercised on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or fear-loading background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would know how to ignore such behaviour due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity with respect to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists process letter diction documents to stop "way harvests".
The report considered by Theresa May also calls for more stringent registration checks in order to prevent the choice list from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters before the choice for your ID.
Use non-removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone from selecting twice.
carry out systematic verifications on a person's nationality in order to ensure that they are elected.
A three-year limit on requests for an automatic letter selection.
Prohibition for political activists to process complete letter selections and envelopes of letter choices.
Give the police the power to set up locks for election stations.
A change in the law that facilitates an intimidation claim in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Volksrepresentation Act 1983).
Photographer prohibition in electoral stations.
Requirement that only English should be used in the election stations (except Wales).
Strengthening the training in order to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the election cabin alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "desperate" that no penalty was made after the Tower Hamlet's case.
"The election court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his alternate to be inappropriate because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
It was guilty for a number of reasons for sufficient, in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the "uneffective controls" of the election registration departments of the councils.
Sir Eric said: "The judgment in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.
Our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of Parliaments, but the worrying and hidden spread of election fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Delivered after Kate's Radler doubleganger and other famous doublegangers of Olympic sportsmen in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympiade in Rio have been admired this week by the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proved to be an impressive doubleganger of the Duke of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic is far from the only gold-fighting athlete that has its own famous double-governmentist this summer - at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are now flirting on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympics that have more than just a certain similarity with Hollywood celebrities.
The hunter and the wolf: team member of the U.S. team in the bow shooting Brady Ellison, left, is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Apart from Kate's bicycle runner, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archers could be the twin of A-Promi Leonardo DiCaprio.
The team member of the U.S. team in the bow shooting Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after showing pictures that he sees incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star.
In fact, the arch protector got the madness of the social media and admitted that he has been hearing from his childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see a great similarity myself, with the exception of facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I'm sure I'll get it up as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be at the centre of this year: the incredible similarity between the British widespringer Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian tournament Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a doubleganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimming pool Cameron van der Burgh has been compared for years with the Glee Star Matthew Morrison.
A Gang Higher: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was drawn between the Tennisstar Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
The Russian silver medal swimmer Yulia Efimova has more than just the sunny skin and blonde hair as the actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian was tested by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt".
Strong women: Football Star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face and eyes
Not the only one: A Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities
Theory put in space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
In fact, the US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and their smiles that are almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney and the gold medal winner in the Gabby Douglas Turn, which has her own beautiful, wide smiles similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympic Games apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer "as a pig has died"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the fourth place of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at Dr 4x200m free-style swim furnished viewers of the CBC live transfer of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize, after one of his commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was "as Mief" and during the race like "a pig died".
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was disabled when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m free-style swim fur.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board to the CBS commentator team to give more "color", could be heard saying: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like mine, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
The Chinese swimer Ai Yanhan, 14, swim the second stage of the swim rod 1:57.79 - 1,61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to unlock the gap in China.
Viewers throughout Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
Emmett Macfarlane tweete, "Has the CBC commentator just said that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "as a pig died"???
The idiot didn't know that they were still on mission."
Ai Yanhan from China was described at the final 4 x 200m free-style swim pig for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with which many talked to him
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how unsensible Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and let us all look like racists.
Shortly later Scott Russel, who moderated the CBC mission, apologized live for the comment from MacDonald and said: "We apologize that the comment on a swimming performance was broadcast."
It was an unhappyly chosen formulation, we are sorry that it has happened."
CBC apologized for more than 90 times at the end of the year with the people who have responded to the comments about Twitter
The commentary colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and apologized to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a communication.
We sincerely regret the fact that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be radiated.
We quickly apologized to our viewers for sending and our followers in the social media last night.
To clarify one, Byron's comments related to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unhappyly chosen formulation. Byron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday afternoon MacDonald apologized in the mission and tried to justify his comment by saying that it was not his intention that it was interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's sweater in the CBC Olympic Mission, he said.
"I was referring to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disrespect was intended and I am very sorry."
Buyers in Primark excited about woman who tastes shamless underwear in the middle of the business
The buyers did not know where to see when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a primary to try underwear.
In order to worsen the situation, she sucked out as she looked in it, pulled her out and put her back to the shelf.
She stove on and tried four pairs of underwears in a business at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone.
The primary business at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underwear before she put her back to the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried the underwear, "she went back and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "The people couldn't believe what they saw."
In the middle of the sales area, she took a couple of underwears from the equipment, pulled out her own pants and trousers, and tried them.
"She didn't even try to find a little more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, freak like Oskar."
"Everybody stared when she pulled out the underwears that she obviously didn't like, because she put them back into the shelf."
She repeated the same with three other underwears before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, dressed and went out again.
"It didn't seem to interfere that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she tried."
Ms. Davidson, 33 who lives in Kent, said: "How horrible to think that someone would take underwear with him who had another person and who had not been washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I learned, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after she went - that's just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new couple of underwears and find out that another woman had her and went out again and had not been washed."
A spokesman from Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday August 9 in our branch in Folkstone."
All the products in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from weapon attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a great master of the Krav Maga Verband in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers near distance.
Regardless of whether you approach from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber.
If you approach yourself from the back, then you should turn around first, so you can see your attacker and "go out of the shooting line," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free elbow.
Then knock him in the bar with the knees and rotate while the attacker collapses from pain, the gun out of his hands. Pull him in his face with the walk and move back while they direct the gun on him.
With attackers approaching from the front, the technology is similar - move your body out of the gun line, take the gun and spin it so that the attackers cannot shoot.
Move the weight on the gun at the same time and beat the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun out of his handle before they move backward and direct the gun to it.
Sounds hard?
Look at the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But remember that when you're a robbery, it's safest to transfer your money - if you're not a crav Maga Grand Master.
Traveller Ian Wright shaves his tongue for a guide at the most dirty places in Europe
A British traveler underwent his immune system and würgereflex a serious test - by distracting some of Europe's most dirty and horrible places.
The moderator and traveler Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, pushed his trains on a Euro-shine, a land at the Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system.
Before leaking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will enter.
But the experiment filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to the day.
The idea of leaking off the dishwasher of a train toilet that has been used by thousands of others may be totally disgusting, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen dish.
On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestines as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he distracted left more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his intestine by traveling through the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public landings at railway stations to wash buttons from toilets, the task set its immune system definitively under one sample
In the film, he said, "I was relatively unconcerned as a child as regards my health and I put all things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he was justified by his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample deterioration showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
Compared to that, the luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak off after its luminometer number was more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the movie, he says, "This is close to the worst thing I smell in a toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I won't touch anything here because it's horrible in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish producer of dairy products Valio.
The company is taking up Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both milk acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestines and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Safts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer the consumer something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We carried out crazy brainstormings that ended by saying "Let Ian call us."
They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the meaning of intestinal health and how they are associated with the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary film, we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added: "Let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he would have leaked some of the things I had commanded him to leak, just like the horrible Russian toilet that is shown in the movie."
Of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to leak them and others with which this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we've recorded some of these dirty delicate things on film."
In a 2015 survey carried out by Valio, 84 percent of all responded milk acid bacteria were associated, especially with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent, saying that they at least used products that contain added milk acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before deloging Social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
One asocial family left her social home after a delogation with a damage of £50,000 because she had terrorized her neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.
After they were violently removed from their property, shocked residents of the housing community found their property in an irreparable state.
The walls show up clapping holes, wooden pieces were poured up, waste was scattered on the floor and Graffiti was smothered on the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.
She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for people here, and I think people don't have to live in this way.
There are many things to be taken into account, as this property is probably not considered as such a beautiful part of Cornwalls.
The family is infamous and its reputation is also.
The couple had three sons who lived in the house in the meantime and the police said that the terror that joined the family included street fights with baseball hits, intimidators of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, warfare and curse.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the rental contract, received an arrangement for antisocial behaviour in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old waste was found
In the property in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden parts were poured up
Neighbors said that they saw her fighting on the street and had to be called the police regularly.
Cornwall Housing told her and her partner this week violently of the property, after she gave them an extended period of 11 weeks to withdraw voluntaryly.
The delogation was commemorated by eased neighbors who said that their life was made hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
"Today tomorrow we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to!
Now, where they're finally gone, it'll be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have missed the family to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overwhelmed side of the municipality house, waste and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It's a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, as a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, since the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terribly involved for their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall and members of the community have done to us courageously and have given us the information.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and give the message that antisocial behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress that was left behind on the ground in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation
Workers of the house administration will now have to clear waste mountains that surround the house
In 2014, the police carried out a razzia in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as weighings, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after she had guilty of her possession of a drug of class B in commercial perspective.
She claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in 2013 in a car accident.
After they were without a home, Tanya and her partner are assumed to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many room walls of the house were decorated with Graffiti.
The police say she'll deloge tenants who don't comply with the order of the house.
Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall informed that the delogue was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house order.
"This is about those who think that they can handle themselves without self-predictions and those who have been damaged by such a behavior," she said.
The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after a deep-flying military jet flies over the beach
Sun worshipers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force Air Force Air Forces Air Force Airplane set an incredible crash flight
Air Forces claimed that it was on a training flight, but persisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when feared tourists begin to panic after a deep-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew almost near the sun worshipers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidayers jumped up when, understandably, they began to worry about the noise of the nozzle engines, without first seeing what came to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly-By into the social media, said: "There really flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane dropping down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were paniced when the plane came from the darkness and incredibly flew deep
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot of the P-3C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deep that this was the only way to identify them.
The speaker said that due to the bad visibility, the jet flew somewhat deeper than usual through nearby surface fires, but the air forces persisted that security was at no time threatened.
Surface fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, where four people also died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese air forces today indicated that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and fire smoke - which restricted his vision.
The plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with concerns against Seville
Seville - The FC Barcelona fights for the first step to the first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans join the Duell around the Spanish supercup against the FC Seville, the replay rising three days later in the Camp Nou.
The double winner must, in power measurements with the lower Cupfinalist and ruling Europe-League champion, among others refrain from Neymar, who is fighting the Olympic football tournament with Brazil.
Goalie Marc-Andre is also missing.
The German has suffered a twist in the knee in the training, which clarifies at least the one question at Barca in favour of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been weaving the status as the number one for two years in Barcelona.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far refused to make a clear decision and left Bravo in the League, but for that, Ter Stegen in most other applications.
Before the first compulsory game of the new play time, the Spanish master doubts about the fitness state of the team, which was humbled on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0:4.
Also at 3:2 in the sample galopp against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Seville again has to digest the 2:3 defeat after the extension of the European supercup against Real Madrid and strives for the second triumph in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is with eleven successes of the record winners in this application.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympiager.
The 27-year-old defeated his countryman and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro.
The world ranking first won the Golden Grand Slam with successes at World Cup, World Tour, World Tour, and Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese did it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves.
This was clear that for the third time, a Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the five rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top of the Olympic Summit was the former SVS-NÖ-Legionary Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and the time-outs they had no coaches with themselves.
They had withdrawn to the tribune and left their shooters alone in fair competition.
"The matches up here I played for my country."
"In the finale I play for myself," Zhang said accordingly.
After the party posed gold and silver medal winners with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpected one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first sentence.
Afterwards he determined the pace on the plate and left Zhang only 13 points.
Due to the superiority of Ma did not develop the expected ripping match.
But nonetheless, there was enough breathtaking ball change to see.
Mizutani won the game for bronze against the 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonow 4:1.
In his quarter finale against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, the White Rips had been injured, afterwards in medical treatment, had to "final" with sheet.
The Sweden Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become similarly high table tennis age Olympia.
Donald Trump admits ′′ violent problems′′ in the election struggle
The leadership of the US republics is plagued by massive concerns, even in traditional conservative states.
President Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republic of Utah.
A rare moment in which the usually large-speed multi-millionary occurring expressed such concerns as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within its own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
"We have enormous problems in Utah," said Trump before evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in important states such as Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Wrong reports about his candidateship, he resumed his well-known media shelters.
Republican high castles wackeling
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June survey by SurveyUSA, Trump and his competitor of the democrats, Hillary Clinton, were the same.
While other institutions are present, Trump is not the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also considered vulnerable.
In an interview by the sender CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wants to stop the advance of Clintons: "Genauso, how I did it before."
And pushed afterwards: This "will be either successful, or I will make a very nice, long vacation".
He doesn't do anything but "to tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him for reasons of political correctness, it would be okay, Trump continued.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump Party should have threatened to cancel funds to support his campaign, it should not be able to present better survey values.
Instead, the Republican candidates for the Congress would like to be more armed.
Olympia: Threeth fraud at Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's light athletes are threatening after the second Doping stage at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro Ungemach.
After attempting fraud at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya sent a trainer home.
The International Olympic Committee informed us to set up a disciplinary commission immediately to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had notified that the former Sprinter and today Coach, John Anzrah, had released an urine test in the Olympic village called the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to Kenya's team leadership by the Doping Controlians.
The World Association IAAF has requested the IOC to provide information on the case to endeavour to investigate its own investigations, an IAAF speaker informed.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, IAAF will assess," said an IAAF declaration.
"He (Anzrah) went to the Doping Control Station and spent himself as Ferguson Rotich, handed the sample and signed," Kenya's Chief de Mission Stephan Arap Soi explained.
He was in possession of accreditation of the athlete who was on the list of training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in 2015 in Beijing WM-Vierter.
Four days earlier, the Kenian Light Athletics Delegation Chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country's money payments about upcoming doping tests.
According to media reports, he should have been arrested when returning to Nairobi Airport.
Kenya has been specially observed at the IOC after numerous doping processes for a long time.
At the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls imposed by the IOC before the Rio games, it was unusually noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into sight.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had exercised a lot of pressure on the African country before summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia began.
As a result, the WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping fight is in accordance with the rules of the WADA.
Kenya is considered a large runner nation.
The country's light athletes won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A number of television reports from the ARD repeatedly claims that in Kenya Doping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound last asked for a similar investigation in Kenya, as he had done it in Russian light athletics.
It could be demonstrated that in this sport, the area was covered and systematically dropped.
Russia's light athletes were then excluded from the summer games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the year Shakespeare, the Salzburg Festivals present the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical into the Temple of Classical and fulfilled the role of Maria's youth dream.
In the orchestra, the Simón Bolívar orchestra under the direction of the venezonal conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swarms.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this scene, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love with Tony with wehmut while the younger Mary plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all because it's musically exceptional!
And then there would be Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she is wise, of course also naive, and very passionate.
"It is very similar to me, my Italian character I have as a Roman," said Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It's such an honor for us to work with her.
It is a vast generous man.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in every movement, in his eyes, it's his life!
It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a happy approach to life, that's very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is high-actual: "In this piece it is about prejudices and fanatism."
Today we have the refugees, then the Puertorians went to New York, and the New York residents did not want them.
They are the same topics, and they are as meaningful today as they were at the time.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, reportedly died in Syria.
The lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air attack in Raqqa, the bollwork of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she intended to leave the war-run land and return to England.
"You can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - people stop ever making this decision," said Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London rose into an airplane towards Turkey and then into a bus at the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says that Clinton will remain in the case of a election victory at Garland as candidate for the Supreme Court
Harry Reid, leader of the Senate Democrats, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
The majority leader at the Senat Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge at the Supreme Court of Antonin Scalia.
On Thursday at a telephone conference, Reid said that he expected to select Garland "with a certain degree of certainty".
A speaker from Reid later said that he hadn't talked to Clinton if she would nominate Garland and speculate him.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't care for unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the top judge for the US Appellation Court for the District of Columbia.
Raid said that Republicaners blocked the Garlands nomination, were lakais and helpers of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found that Donald Trump was inappropriate for the Presidential Office.
Treats wants nackkalendar for "women and men"
The Treats Magazine works with the photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s pirelli-inspired Kalendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The editor of Treats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine distinguished from oldschool playboys because "playboy is for men".
I'll do this for women.
Apparently, he believes that the Calendar does.
"We have to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nakedness, in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these pictures of a female body," said Shaw in a press release to publish the Kalendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful artwork.
Models can submit their pictures online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish municipality expects mass flight
"Whoever doesn't fit and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-nahe Stiftung Dialog und Welt, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of refugees from Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become "a few hundred thousand", believes the Association Chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the putting attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand refuge seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says Ali Toprak, chairman of the "World" of Friday.
Because the government had already overwhelmed Kurdish fortunes with criminal actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the veiled Putsch, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to re-start in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It can't be that a state that takes refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The Chief of the Association complained that Syrian Arabs were settled in Kurdish but also in Alevitan cities.
So Erdogan wants to increase the excursion pressure to the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also CDU member.
The Head of Association demanded that the Federal Government be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and its followers".
In Germany too, a "hexenjagd" takes place against Erdogan critics.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months.
The German branch of the Gülen-Bewegung also fears the escape of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will search for asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionals.
The brand marking as a golden trailer destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.
"Whoever doesn't fit and praise Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-nearst Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper calls on numbers of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks set the largest group of asylum authorized in Germany for political persecution before the Putsch.
At the 30th of June, this was 11,386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all asylum-authorized people (39,625).
In this survey, the fled before war, poverty, or perspectivelessness are not found.
Asylum entitled under the basic law are exclusively political, i.e. governmental, individually persecuted.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Going where it hurts"
Seltsame Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals don't get anything from the summer election fight with - and the holidays from North Rhine-Westphalia may not choose the country day.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they understood.
In 2021, the election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Swedish Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
For it is more stupid than so far: summer holidays, heat and land-day election struggle - it bites.
The locals who are to be convinced by the election fighters are on vacation.
Most of the holidaymakers traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so do not choose the country day.
There are practical problems: In the holidays, helpers hanging posters, blowing up balloons, dividing flyers and counting voices are only effortful.
Until September 4th, 2016, the election and last holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has once again to let election struggle almost pass the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, must be afraid of his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, now lies clearly behind the CDU in surveys.
Excitingly, how strong Neuling AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition suitable.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election struggle, one looks off his large posters.
He travels through the country, spreads roses and plauses a little with the people, just as his legendary vocabulary predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, soulring has got cold feet and Kanzler Merkel blames for the blooming of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her "We're creating this" has accelerated the rise of the legal populists, which will probably cost him now the beautiful office.
The CDU with its top candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is to make elections at the wrong time in the right place.
She has invited Chancellor Angela Merkel twice to the Grand Duchy; Merkel Bundestagswahlkreis is located in the northeast.
But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliner and Sachsen there than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it does not hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.
Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU is largely renounced by the usual election campaigns on marketplaces and before shopping centres with umbrellas and air balloons.
That, according to Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that on the grounds of land, it has to work hard to find a wire to the people again.
It's like the left, the SPD, the Green: it's hardly available in the land.
However, the Council of the CDU wrestler Kokert to his competitors is also self-evident: "You must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday celebration must be used".
Since a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly engaged election struggle.
In surveys, the social democrats lasted with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and only nearly before the AfD (19).
At the 2011 election, the SPD won clearly 35.6 percent before the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the surveys, should make the jump into the country day.
They make a modern virtue from the holiday not and move their campaign largely to the Internet.
"Online-Wahlkampf", it's called the national president Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green choosing fighters are looking for local citizens among the holidays.
Silke Gajek, the peak candidate, just kurves through the mecklenburg lakes with a houseboat and enjoys it.
Her impression: "Wahlurlaub in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a penalty."
B27 rehabilitation: hostages suffer from locking
At the speed with which the B 27 is renovated, there is nothing to mecker.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 a.m. and ends only at 20 p.m., there is all half a praise.
"They've made everything pretty tricky," Elvira Tetzlaff says of the jet tank station.
That's a super team.
There's no delay either.
At the beginning of the week, the construction site could be shifted to the south in the mid-term, until the end of October.
It also praises the presence of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to the establishment of assistance.
Since the construction site changed to the south on Monday and also the locking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg was re-established, the traffic situation has been relaxed within the place.
Citizens are now able to ride from the B 27 again on both sides.
The fall-out traffic through the place seems to be declining.
"There were some significant complaints," says the Deputy Head of Director Florian King, responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many of the trails were looking for and trusted to their Navi rather than the signing.
As a result, some trucks were burned in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were not respected, the municipality increased demanding the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant surgeries," says King, who once informed himself about the situation on site.
There have already been two to three per minute flashes.
The fastest was travelling with 77 kilometres of hours in the 30-zone.
Since the construction site has been relocated, however, it has become calmer.
For businessmen at the B 27 it is just a little comfort that the road is now open for customers from Rottenburg.
You don't like to look into the cards for businessmen.
But that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to turnover breaks, let everyone you ask look through.
However, some are more and some are less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. for other companies produced, for whom the renovation has little consequences.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highest slight decline" at the Autohaus Maier, but admits that, of course, "the career is missing".
The most strong are the locals along the street.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words.
That's already threatening to exist.
Not only him, but all the restaurants "have hit it hard".
The customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil.
We must be happy about every euro turnover.
The turnover decreases to "over 50 percent".
==References====External links==
Half of his employees he had to leave.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been released, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt answered on a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would benefit from the benefits of the situation at B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation.
Göhner knows about other districts where such a little more generous was handled.
With all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.
Finally, since 1715 the family business has been located here, he refers to the long history.
He can understand that other passengers are now less frequently watching by because of the complicated transportation.
If you can't go, it's nice somewhere else.
The fact that his home clients return after the end of the rehabilitation work, Göhner has no doubt.
Despite the crisiss with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of B 27 buildings on his clientage for the greatest crisis his home has experienced in her long-term history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
Ongoingly, on behalf of the fight against terrorism, laws are being screwed.
After the recent attacks, Minister of Interior de Maizière now presents a thick security package.
But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say to all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All his proposals would be "politically acceptable to the coalition partner", says the Federal Minister for Security in the presentation of his new security package.
You're not overwhelming anyone.
Other further points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also share in it.
However, as the interior minister, he was located on results and on a "determinable consensus" within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has left a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they now fall more extensively.
Some is already known, announced, suggested: The need for a new security authority to take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Neither does Germany have to implement several EU standards on passenger data and weapons law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is not surprising.
In part, de Maizière launches a second approach for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: He wants to punish sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to distract jihadists with double citizenship from the German passport.
"They will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
However, he considers this to be acceptable and does not require anything that the coalition partner has no chance at all.
The Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
They have it partly in themselves: It plans fast procedures for deportation and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation.
Refugees, targeted to the country, should have their smartphones checked beforehand and open social media accounts for a security check.
In case of tolerations for rejected asylum applicants, he wants to make some worse than before - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to deteriorate their identity.
Some of them are political and legally delicate.
Some things are still unchecked and leave questions open.
And in some points, for example in the inequality of patience, the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that the people were deeply busy have not been exterminated even in election times.
Internal security has become enormously focused.
First the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, they're fighting elections.
Union and SPD are therefore becoming increasingly positioned on the subject of internal security.
In the past days, between the two parties went high.
First, a crushed dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security policy of ideas gathering some of the Union's internal ministers, in which the heads of the Resort also demand a ban on Burka and a retreat from the double citizenship.
De Maizière is also working here to make sense of sounds.
He doesn't think of a trip from the double passport.
We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.
Reopening it, it's not meaningful.
And in the case of a ban on Burka, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional and whether it is actually "remutable" for the coalition partner, it has to be shown.
There's a lot of things in it that could cause conflict.
However, the SPD is currently trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
The leader of the party, Sigmar Gabriel, first signals cautiously ready to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security".
People's cars are still brilliant.
Despite diesel candals, delivery numbers are rising worldwide.
But not in all markets it's going around.
With the callback action, there is a word of twist.
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year during the delivery.
Although Europe's largest automobile manufacturer can continue to offer a bonus in the previous year despite the diesel affairs thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
However, in July, the VW core brand weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus stressed the overall sale as reported in the Dax company.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold with 449100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market in China, sales were 14 percent below the previous month.
In Germany's home market, the deliverys dropped by almost one sixth.
Trademark sales chief Jürgen Stackmann reduced the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe.
In addition, in some core markets, "changed economic conditions" have retained purchases.
In addition to the situation in Turkey, the British vote had also stressed the withdrawal from the EU, a spokesperson explained.
In the United States, where the exhaust gas affairs first escalated, there is also a minute to book.
Large support for VW is the Chinese market.
In total, the main domestic trademark of Lower Saxony is still more conspicuous by the diesel candal: After the first seven months, only an extradition minus is available from 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to continue to present a sales plus from January to July.
1.3 percent of the number of cars produced by Volkswagen during this period, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated with a software exhaust gas testing.
In Germany alone, VW calls about 2.5 million cars for retrofitting into the workshops.
In the course of the retrofit, VW confirmed that the reconstruction of cars has no negative effects.
After the retrofitting of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power.
After the retrofitting, the car manufacturer shall issue the customers a "guarantee-like" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called in business circles on Friday.
Reasons are legal fines.
The "Focus" reported that Volkswagen now guarantees his German customers a guarantee for refined diesel models.
This had confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
From the Ministry of Transport, it was confirmed that there was this meeting.
"VW must fully fulfil the requirements of my Inquiry Commission and the KBA."
"Deviations are not accepted," said Federal Minister for Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the Ministry.
VW has taken over the guarantee that no deteriorations take place in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or motor power after the retrofitting and that all type-approval values are unchanged.
People's cars themselves do not use the term "guarantee" as it was called in business circles.
With the wide term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, will come to a workshop for half a year after the retrofitting, for example, with an engine damage - and this could lead back to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of customers it is also important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, as it was said, uncertainty regarding possible warranty schemes.
That's why VW does not use the term "guarantee".
The Raiffeisenbank Gmund at the Tegernsee demands rich savings in future penalties - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank Chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on Giro or Day Money Accounts."
The Bundesverband Deutscher Banken speaks of a single case and does not see a signal in it: Normal savingsers should not "be afraid to pay for their savings-grand penalty interest".
Banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
This fee will be charged by the Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September to September by private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros back to Giro or Daily Money Accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 costs 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
For some time, he has been wearing 40 million euros, which could be lifted from one day to another and which he could not use.
"They are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs," said the banking chief.
"I can't put 4000 euros for every million."
The costs will now continue in accordance with the polluter principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be too dangerous: "I've already experienced four attacks, I don't want the fifth!", said the banking board.
Most customers had understanding and changed to other investment forms.
Only a few migrated to other banks.
The Association of Cooperatives Bavaria stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks."
It is not possible to carry them alone "for a permanent period of time".
Some German banks have therefore increased their charges for account management, credit cards or transfers.
The Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land with its Skatbank-Filiale 2014 had made headlines with penal interest on deposits from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, head of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay charges for deposits, for which the competition in Germany is much too strong under banks and savings banks."
A banker said that at the Lake Tegern there is "a customer that is somewhat more luxurious with the property".
"This can be a problem for a small bank," if she keeps money free.
Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
In the region, well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live.
The Association of Cooperatives Bavaria "is currently not known to any other banks that calculate a deposit allowance for private customers' deposits," said Sprecher Ernst.
The President of the Federal Association of German Volksbanks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, explained at the end of June: "The threshold to go to the negative to the private customer is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it threatened the migration of investors to compete.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the width.
Destination Plates: Who actually buys records?
Single men middle age love plates.
Before you hurry into the comment part to transmit it under the pseudonym NietAllSomeMembersMiddies with rough injuries, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the widespread re-establishment of records is not due to a tree in Millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently purchased a record are anticipated at the age of 45 to 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional significance: older record buyers keep their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending alone time (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov?
If this blog was a news report on the television, the camera would follow me while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stealing wildly before I stand down, holding my hands and saying something in a certain way like, "So, let's take a closer look."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Sohos slowly breaks up its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic record special shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and mind by observing.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around 20), is one day for a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I'm asking?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These audio plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.
The reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy again items he sold when he was young and piled.
"Many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things where I was probably a little too young to buy them to me," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend alone time, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
That's my slander.
Wez, 25 who works with Sister Ray also believes that many of the customers he meets are true of the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hip, people who have heard about the comeback and seeing themselves induced to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I have conducted, people have usually released their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
This would explain to the tree to pendants of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?
It takes only a few seconds in a business such as Phonica to see that record businesses offer a calming community of equal-hearted people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took insight into the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar record shells, from objects that wake up happy youth reminders.
"I think it may sometimes be a kind of comfort to fill an empty or possession of material possessions," says Wez.
It's so with me as a collector, and I think it's so with many people.
It is a simple way to engage in spiritual matters.
"We are like their social workers!" an employee evacuates from a record stack.
A ICM survey in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I would leaf through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age), has observed a "Trophaeen aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just recently came in here and said, "I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record so that I can put it into the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it is definitely happening.
More product load, less musical.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older people, who come in slowly.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists making photos, teenage boys and women middle age.
Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts' latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz, it is good to see such diversity with customers.
None of them look specially lonely, but nightling psychic traumas are difficult to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around in business for a few minutes and views the Varietät of the plates for sale.
She makes a window bumble rather than a big shopping.
She doesn't deserve much, so the collection of records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It is easy to hear music from a computer or other way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives off with a desperate sigh.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a business that is said that a new generation of record lovers should have inspired: Urban Outfitters.
While I appear to smell the jeans hot pants, I observe a group of young teenage girls who group around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley recorder.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - maybe because they're just decorative, some so far above that it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art".
But in view of the fact that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain.
It is not surprising that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research showed that YouGov's results are in the vote, they, at least in plate shops in Soho, leave the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record shops and online forums unaware.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday tomorrow with the bumbles through plate shops of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates while avoiding the staring view of an incredible, 30-year-old false moderator, who raises up over the shoulders of no-conceived men middle-age.
The Greenlandhai is the longest live spine - video report
Scientists say that Greenlandhai has the longest life span of all spine animals on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who investigates sharks, says that the record was with a female, which is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French Court refuses offer on demolition of shops in the jungle Refugee Camp
A French court has rejected a offer of the authorities in Calais to break down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
In a court proceedings this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be entitled to cut down 72 provisional transactions in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, to provide hairdryers services or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The prefecture Calais argued that these places should be cut down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would present a risk of fire and health.
Humanitarian groups informed the court that shops and restaurants were important, since the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the warehouse.
They also concluded that the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille decided that there was no legal basis for exercising people who operated the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely perceived."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the downbreak was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated commonly and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum for the hundreds of needy, unjoined minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure "for these children would be a catastrophe of which the last eight years are."
On Friday, the two aid organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge of the migrant estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp had increased to over 9,000 - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase of new arrivals over the summer.
Despite Olympia disappointment: Martin remains fighting
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trip, Radprofi Tony Martin does not want to be undermined.
"I keep the World Cup in sight, stay confident and continue fighting," wrote the 31-year-old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro at Facebook.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelveth place on the sugar hat.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on the time-ride of yesterday," said Martin.
He had to analyze the reasons for Debakel alone.
In October, in Qatar, Martin wanted to compete for the title.
"I'll look at all that we've changed in recent times."
"These also counts my position," wrote the three-time world champion who lost on Wednesday on 54.5 km more than three minutes on Olympician Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennisprofi Siegemund misses halffinals
The victory of Laura Siegemund ended in the quarter final of Rio: The world rankings-32. from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-Nr.
34) the half-final of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, plagued by back problems, could only carry out their impact once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) had the chance of jumping into the front round.
The Australian-Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had picked up a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTE launchers in the quarter final of summer games had last been given in 1992.
There was never a German duo in an Olympic single half-final.
Groups increase when starting up for live video game transfers
Watching other people when playing video games is a riecent trend - of which Microsoft also wants to benefit.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam that specialized in this hobby.
How much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft didn't communicate on Thursday.
Beam started with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can look at others while playing, but also intervene.
For example, they can give up missions to players and present enemies as well as equipment.
The player's Activision Blizzard starts a new HD video service for the booming world of the e-sport.
On the way to global media event, Facebook is to help.
The advertising industry is already horrifying.
The staff of the start-up, which has its seat in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, relocate to the Microsoft headquarters in the Californian Redmond, as Beam co-founder and chief Matt Salsamendi reported.
There is therefore no need to change for customers through the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam is integrated into the video play department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video play activities is currently growing rapidly.
Known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 by the online dealer Amazon - for almost one billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming belongs to the Google Mother Alphabet.
Here comes the enforcement trailer
Germany's Raser has to adjust to the next generation of speed knives: In various federal countries, including in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash devices are tested to transmit speed-sundors particularly effectively.
The futuristic enforcement trailers of Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accidental points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway buildings or to renovate bridges with temporary speed limits, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits with a stationary lighter.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is autark: Its battery holds five days at uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measuring technology, all vehicles can also be collected over several tracks simultaneously.
Variable speed limits as well as transit prohibitions after time, roads and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In high-rise state, you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with a trailer ring.
In order not to just be cluded, he is lowered in the measurement operation, so that the wheels in the pants and, by the way, also fire-proof outer shell disappear.
A built-in alarm system also aims to protect the lightning from vandalism.
Since 2015, the trailer has been tested and used in various federal countries, according to Vitronic.
Foreign authorities also blitz with the new technology: Jüngst France has ordered 100 pieces, after ordering 150 pieces last year.
United Kingdom fetches silver in the 7th Rugby after Fiji picks Masterclass Gold
The impressive power of the UK at the 7th Rugby came to an abrupt stop at the last hurdle in the form of Fiji when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-steping, afterrücken, line run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympia medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad comfort of the silver medal - the fourth of Britain on that day - and they could be very proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they struck New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the half-final on the same day could fall back to them in the final.
But regardless of this, Fiji would have hit a 15-man team in best form.
It could be a comfort for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one British will have a gold medal hanging around his neck: Fiji's chief trainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind him.
Eight years ago, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens under Ryan.
They just lost one here.
This step will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji began wonderfully and left the attacks of GBs from Spass.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. to run in driving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0, when Osea Kolinisau crossed in the corner.
With four more minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he transformed.
12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.
A great tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood for GB 0-17.
Nakarawa added a new since the re-establishment and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravou preached through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB carried out fundamental changes in the mid-term and closed the Phyian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua Homeova passed after a brilliant intermediate play from Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea islanders, whose fans sang, flags swinged and danced on the tribune.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame has put the i-tuple with another attempt in the last seconds.
The pepper sounded, the Fijis embraced themselves and GB kicked devastatingly in the grasses.
Earlier in the day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the half-final with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a scarce half-final match from the race - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and reached a gate under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-aside team, secured the profit - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the tractor's cancer to the row victory
There will be no more emotional gold than these games, and that's what it wants.
From the first row to the last 220 hard hills that enter into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional significance in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though there were only the two who sat at the row, there were three voices in the boat. The Echo of Trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rode to the second Olympic Gold in the two without tax woman, the first women in the history of British sports, which laid such a scale.
Their dominance was absolute, at least her 39th untreated use, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes who slide over the surface with the elegance of cocks, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to grace.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental progress that makes the difference and it was no one more helpful than the trainer who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all than was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bubble cancers that are operational and they did.
If you don't, he's spreading everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a little the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The Trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption at a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances at all.
I needed money, so soon I had to get better.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.
That's how it starts.
Rudding itself is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediateness of the victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nervous drifting morning a little more than otherwise to talk and thus tried to cope with his own fears.
Stanning, who was headman in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. This may be something extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.
There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thanks goes to him. He's the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't have wished a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost any race in the last five years.
The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not hold.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to lock up, Stanning and Glover had too much reserved.
We were very caught at the moment.
Helen called "remain in the process, stay in the process".
It is really important not to get rid of it.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't trying to do something great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, whatever we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before it will make decisions about his future.
Glover has to appear on a wedding next week, her own with the TV adventure Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London it took about six months to understand that I was a Olympician.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better," she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the Water Purpose Association "Veitenstein Group", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered to be a "bayer-wide exemplary".
A small francic water-purpose association as an example for the large water producers.
So it was some time ago in the original tone in a contribution from the Bavarian radio.
Shortly later, the water forum of the government of underfraining honored the purpose association.
The work of the Veitenstein group was "bayern-wide as exemplary".
After all, Rupert Göller, who was employed 31 years in the purpose association, stands for 28 years as managing director.
He was now retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Purpose Association of Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and provides 32 places and villages with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities of the municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and Baunach.
For other cities and communities there are water supply contracts.
The current Chairman, Breitbrunn's Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was set up as a water station in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Purpose Association in 1988.
"Their tasks have been very diverse and ranged from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, budget creation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency expenses at weekends," said the chairman.
As outstanding events, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the new wells (1998), the compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of the high tanks (1999), the re-establishment of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There has been no stopping, and it has always been renewed because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He used himself with a lot of heart blood for his water-purpose association and he lived the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he had been allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group to nitrate reduction before the water forum of the district underfranken.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.
He's the best waterkeeper and he was a faithful boy.
Together, we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to the fountain construction and the restructure of the purpose association.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, was the tube break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on January 3.
This will have to work through the whole night at minus 17 degrees, so that the villages could be provided with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could also only be maintained because the high tanks of Pettstadt were filled with snails.
The management of the Drinking Water Purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who followed Rupert Göller.
Sopranistin Anna Netrebko is open to the autism of her son Tiago - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," said the 44-year-old Italian newspaper "Corriere della Sera".
When the disease had been recognized by her son, she believed she had to die.
The eight-year-old Tiago had come forward well and now learn privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: if I ask him something that is two years behind when I sang at the Scala mailing agent, he remembers nothing," said Netrebko.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebkos connection with the bassbariton Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationshipstat in Bargteheide - Man Shoots on Lifemate
A 35-year-old man shot on Friday at 10:45 a.m. in a multi-family house in Bargteheide (Crees Stormarn) on his partner and hurt her deadly.
"The man even called and told us to shoot his lifemate," said a police speaker.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him it is publicly found.
In the meantime, all the way to the country, Sven S. could be on the way by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters large, muscular, brown and has a glaze.
Now the police have published a photo of him.
But it's a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears a glaze.
The man shouldn't be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, says the police.
If you see Sven S., you'll call the 110.
The police are talking about a relationship state.
The victim was the year 1988, the perpetrator 1981.
At first, the police in Lübeck did not want to make any information about Tathergang or the relationship between offenders and victims; but it confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a killing offence."
"We don't say more," said a police speaker in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a special commission (SEK) was in the Tatort.
Steel - Light view for the German steel industry
The crises-based and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared by additional costs in millions.
Financial burdens threatened by the sector from the eco-power support are from the table.
It remains in the liberation from the renewable energy environment in the stock plants for the so-called own electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue).
"I am really glad that we could finally achieve this after two years of tight negotiations."
Accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to request the steel manufacturers, which use gases from the high oven to produce electricity for their own consumption.
According to the German Industry Association, the steel industry threatened additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel said to the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the EU Commission after discussions with the Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators are replaced in the steel plants is a EEC repository of 20 percent.
But also this is not raised in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission on the production of electricity.
Thus, the status Quo of the previous regulation is largely defined.
The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry have a special significance.
"In view of our campaign 'Stahl is the future', this is a first step."
"More you have to follow."
"Climate and employment objectives must also be considered in the reform of emission rights trade," said IG Metall-Chef Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacities and a significant price pressure.
Last year, the situation continued to grow as the world’s largest producer country of China threw massive steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers suggest price dumping from Chinese steel companies.
In the course of this spring, the situation has a little relaxed.
On the one hand, import duties imposed on import steel effect, on the other, the economic prospects in China have been illuminated.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prismus Thyssenkrupp remained careful on Thursday.
Lastly, prices would have been more stagnated.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude closures of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced at 3.4 million tons well six percent less raw steel than in the previous month, as the steel industry union announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the volume produced now went back the second month.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent below the previous year.
In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with a rise in emissions.
Community, Spirit, Health: Singing does well Seniors
The singing has already accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teaching office she occupied music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a sample, she feels balanced, happy and altogether more alive, she says.
At the same time, she does something good to her health and to her mind.
Because singing is just from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with the likes, describes Hackler.
Due to regular cooperation, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because social and family structures are often solved at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
This experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir: "Please and organize, rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of coexistence".
Singing can be effortful in a positive sense, says Hackler.
For older people train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of the puss so fast in everyday life.
Even if it is about getting the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.
On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Community of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening of songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, self deteriorated people discover long-lasting events.
When singing, the head is also required for special performance, explains Lenz.
At the same time, focus on your own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers – this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only to concentrate on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition gained by singing in the choir, said Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
The sense of self-value also grows by singing in the choir.
To show myself: When I exercise for a long time, I get better and wake out of me - this experience strengthens.
So good reasons to start singing are enough.
Whoever wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes next?
Looking for the appropriate offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintance sings in a senior choir, you can easily join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can turn directly to the church or the church leader.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.
Anyone who does not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help in the Internet search.
If you want to sing, you should join a choir, advise Hackler.
Singing does well to the soul and has something liberating - that applies to every age.
Cats react more sensitive than cats to screams of the young animals
Biologists have investigated in Hanover the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To her surprise, the Miauen also did not leave the males cold - but they always kept the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the excitement of cat babies on the miauen of the little ones.
They react by ten percent faster to sounds of kittens, which are in great need, as scientists from the veterinary university and the Medical University of Hannover (MHH) have found out.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"The acoustic differences between the miauen of less and strongly raised young animals are apparently not perceived or not important for the males," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MH.
She is the first author of the study published this Friday at the Fachmagazin "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous investigation, the research team had already found that the duration and height of the kitten screams differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal holding of the MHH were observed.
They were preceded for a call from young people who were taken out of the wormbox for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were faced with screams of more earned kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
Despite the low sample, the researchers consider their results meaningful.
"All females, even those who have not yet had their own offspring, reacted differently to the cry," said Konerding.
They turned faster to the speaker when this call was played by the very excited kittens.
This ability may be born or developed with the maturity.
"A surprise was that the males responded at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans.
Some studies also showed that women responded more sensitive to infants, whether they were mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski grabs with "Gala" after Supercup
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
A detention warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the punching attempt, an important football game takes place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul around the supercup in Konya, the official line is clearly stated: "Business as usual".
Even when the state of exception was imposed after the return in July, the government reiterated that the daily lives of normal citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, which is responsible for the putting trial.
There is no stopping for the football.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor issued a warrant.
Accordingly, the meanwhile living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is supposed to be followers of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is responsible for the putting trial by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Although the initial exceptional condition for 90 days is still valid until October, it actually has no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly "Democracy-wakes" in public places throughout the country declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into followers and opponents of Erdogan.
Particularly fans of the Besiktas Worker Club are not traditionally among the President's friends.
However, what the greatest of the Turks enters in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military legs.
There even the fans agree themselves - no matter whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
At Pocal victor "Gala" it will arrive especially again on Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne's sports value proved in the past season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old ended his first play time as a topscorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he achieved the 1:0 victor.
The newspaper "Fanatic" cried to him, "He was the best in the place."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the pocal.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season for the record champion found a comprehensible conclusion.
After the previous round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lions" also dismissed early in the Europa League.
In the Suffer Lig it was only rank six.
The season wasn't good.
The Pocal was the only way to win something.
"We've done that and that's the most important thing," said Podolski.
For Master Besiktas, the game year was better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who laid the foundation for the 14th title with 26 season hits as a Suffer-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
That is also the reason that the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
The Gomez, awarded to Besiktas under the agreement of the AC Florence, had only announced after the attempt to refrain from returning to the country because of the political situation in the country after its EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he only has to say it," quoted the journal "Kicker" Club Chief Fikret Orman.
However, the storms would have to be willing to refrain from about a third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman made clear: "We cannot pay its salary at Florence."
Despite Doping, these athletes still have medal opportunities at Olympia in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin was already blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other light athletic-soners have only been able to laugh about it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of Doping remains the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had complained her start-up right shortly before the games, was puffed out and bumped out gracelessly at her start (100 meters of chest).
It was a tremendous scene: with a smile she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was established that she would not get gold, the audience broke out into a jubilee tower.
But there are many more athletes who, despite doping history, start at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-staff/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in light athletics.
He was already blocked twice for dopings (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his ban, the Olympicians of 2004 and ex-world champion run even faster than before, he is over 100 m in 9.80 seconds the number one of the world and is considered the largest challenger of Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaica): The two-fold Olympician and seven-fold world champion had to sit down a six-month block in 2010 after she was shown the use of the oxycodon pain agent.
She had strong tooth pain after surgery, defended the 29-year-old.
Sandra Perkovic (Diskus/Croatia): 2011, the 2012 Olympic champion, 2013 world champion and European champion, was positively tested for the banned stimulant medium Methylhexanamin from 2010 to 2016.
Perkovic disagrees with the scientific take-up and was locked for six months.
The four widest worsts this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympiac and two-fold world champion over 400 m, had been tested positively in 2010 and locked 21 months.
A penis enlargement means were responsible, said Merritt.
This year the 30-year-old is over 200 and 400 metres the fastest man in the world to date.
Iwan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): No one athlete is likely to have been recognized so many medals afterwards.
So Tichon lost his WM title of 2005 nine years later, after he had been diagnosed with Testosteron Doping.
The now 40-year-old had to give Olympia Silver in 2004 because of steroid dopings and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse.
He also received the well-known bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a judgment by the International Sports Court of CAS.
With 80,04 m, he is on the rank of two of the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world recorder and gold favorite was tested positively in May but can still start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of the use of a banned food supplement, the blocks of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA fell mild and ended on July 13th.
Bombenterror in Thailand - Austrian Injured - Several Dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said the speaker of the Foreign Ministry, Thomas Schnöll, Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and was treated in the hospital, but she had already been able to leave this again.
She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket and in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens, it is still unclear.
In this respect, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is constantly in contact with the local authorities, says Schnöll.
In the approximately 200 kilometers south of the capital of Bangkok, Hua Hin was first exploded in two bombs on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a Thai woman had been killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two leaps went up again, according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb explosion was also reported by Phuket in the early days.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the bath beach of Patong, popular with vacationers, according to police statements.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing a city employee.
According to the authorities, the leap rate had gone into the air in a flower beet in front of the coastal police district.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast demanded several injuries.
One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning to journalists.
"We assume that it is a coordinated attack."
It is too early to express itself to possible motives - but it is probably about the deeds of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the Muslim separatists in the south of the country in the attacks.
The Thai police, on the other hand, explained that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage that is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities had received secret service indications of upcoming attacks in the south of the country, but they had not been informed of the exact time and locations.
It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.
The police instructed their officials throughout the country to strengthen the security of important government buildings as well as airports, railway stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are often smaller bomb attacks, but they usually do not address tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used over years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Following the current bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (Security Level 3) was charged for the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After conflicts between security forces and Muslim populations, unnecessary journeys to these provinces will be deprived.
Increased security risk (Security Level 2) applied for the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence even in the coming years.
Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country is moving towards stability, improving the economic situation and tourism.
The military tonna, which had taken power after a phase of bloody unrest in 2014, is beneficial to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has not managed the uprising of Muslim rebels in the outer south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were also killed in Bangkok when attacking a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack of the younger history of the country.
The right "Identitarian Movement" is in the visa of the Federal Constitutional Protection Office.
After several national offices, the constitutional guards in the Confederation have also monitored the group.
"We see at the 'Identitarian Movement' points for attempts against the freedom of democratic basic order," said the Head of Constitutional Protection Hans-Georg Maaßen der Deutschen Presseagentur in Berlin.
In this way, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are dispersed in an extremist way.
That's why we're watching the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group of French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012.
It turns against "multi-culture", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "lost of your own identity by alienation".
Constitutional Protector in Nine Federal States - Bremen, Bayern, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thüringen - are already watching the "identities".
Maaßen said that his authority had agreed closely with the national authorities in the decision.
"Groups such as the 'Identitarian Movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the Head of Constitutional Protection.
Generally, extremists try to speak to them with youthful language, often with poppy music.
This was done by Islamists as well as by legal extremists.
This isn't a good advertising for your own thing.
Propaganda is supposed to address people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Lastly, there have been reports from several federal countries on contacts with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he didn't have any insights.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point of view.
It is important whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - will change its target direction by certain people who are extremist and thus become extremist.
It is therefore crucial whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This cannot be seen.
In view of the significant increase in legally motivated crimes and assaults on asylum seekers and refugees, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be legal terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.
It may well be that other legal terrorist groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee homes or attacks from other legal extremist motives.
A German country-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognized.
The previous groups had been created at regional or social level.
Carefully, Majesty expressed that many attacks went on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worried one.
Many of the suspects of asylum attacks had not previously been known as criminal, politically motivated criminals or followers of the right scene.
"So many people have committed crimes that had nothing before with legal extremists, which might have been politically indifferent or elected, for example, CDU, SPD or left, but then radicalized by right extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes Internet Hit
Not always the Olympics or World Records determine the headlines in the Olympic Games.
This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte in the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swimed so slowly that he could not be seen in the TV images.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the section was chosen.
In the social networks, Habte became a viral Internet heater.
Actually, the 24-year-old with a residue of 48 seconds ends his advance and occupied the 59th place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not just a sporting figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old participate in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international Swimming Association.
This is distributed to make swimming more known in underrepresented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something else.
Preparation is all: Robel Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.
The first nicknames made the round quickly.
Some media called him "Robel of the whale".
The English boulevard leaf "The Sun" with "Dad Bod" was funny about him.
His time, he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, played no role.
Comparison with "Eric the Eel" was also drawn.
During the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani took media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to enter a predecessor of over 100 meters of free style alone.
Frenetian Moussambani was fired at the time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

An open industrial voyage in DTLA receives a cozy makeover
We celebrate the 90th birthday of the central library of L.A. with - what else? - a new book.
Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Place has been stolen.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her business on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at 8.15 p.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the checkout.
No traces of the offender could be found.
There is also no video monitoring.
Trump doesn't see the threatening affairs so close
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a election event in Florida.
Donald Trump already has an alternative idea if it does not become anything with the choice of the US president.
He'll ride on the holiday.
Donald Trump loses the US presidency elections in November would not matter to him: "In the end, it will either work, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," said the Republican candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, it is okay, Trump said.
Thus he referred to the U.S. President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, as the founder of the Islamic State (IS).
Within his party, more and more opposition was formed.
Post increases in trade with electric transporters
An electrical extra vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the companion is apparently great.
The post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
Shortly, the Group wants to start trading with the transporter.
The post wants to offer its electric transporters from the next year on the free car market.
"We want to enter the sale to third parties," said a post speaker on Friday.
The company has been checking for months whether it is to sell its own developed StreetScooter, with which letters and packages are delivered, to other companies.
Postal board Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were repeated demands, for example by craftsmen.
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel" the Bonner Group is about to shortly enter the mass production of the vehicles.
In the post-owned factory, the company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and to set up a complete conversion to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will make a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK direction shall be deducted after disappointing business figures
The GfK consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not quite surprising.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes more uncertain, the longer the success he promised.
turbulence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the withdrawal of the management, the world number Five of the industry is ahead of a personal new start.
GfK Board Chief wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board of Arno Mahlert already dismisses the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The Executive Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger on 1 September, informed the company.
He should officially take over the function of a board speaker until a successor was found for Hartmann.
As a reason for the withdrawal, the company called "difference views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
Details didn't mean to mention a company speaker on Friday.
Anyone who will lead the market research company is still unclear.
On Friday, it was said that the shareholders were last disappointed by the remaining successes of the restructuring launched years ago.
Mr Hartmann has been at the GfK team since 2011.
"The fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after five years," it said.
In view of the last bad number of GfK businesses, every shareholder will at some point be disturbing.
"If that was the case with BMW, the quandts would do that," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss trip in the previous quarters even in the second quarter of 2016.
With EUR 361.2 million, turnover was 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable previous quarter.
As regards the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent by 721.2 million euros.
The profit in the second quarter has been particularly stressed by the decrease in the value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The corporate depreciation of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business sector, gave the Group a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, the GfK had earned another Group profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus rushes in Krummhorn in graves: eight injured
In case of an accident of a bus with 43 seniors as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhorn (Aurich County).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police informed.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid its data as a result of a counter-trailer.
The bus came right from the street and slipped into a grave, as a speaker of the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"According to the bus's location, people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The firearm liberated the prisoners.
Six rescue cars and an emergency car came to the accident site on the Landstraße 2.
The unleaded travelers were brought back from a line bus to the district of Pewsum Krummhorn.
There they should wait for a substitute bus from the travel company.
The investigators urged the deceiver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The charges per cubic metre of wastewater are as from 1 October 2016 for the area of wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3.44 instead of €2.10; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (up to 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (todays 2.18 euros).
The installation in Azendorf will increase the waste water fee at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are needed.
After an overlapping calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the Kulmbach Land Council has found that there are undercovers for these wastewater plants when the budget was approved.
The Kasendorf market is obliged, on the basis of legal basis, to operate the plants in a cost-effective manner.
From 1 October 2016, the citizens, as well as the commercial and industrial holdings from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to fall deeper into the pocket.
The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.
As director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the charges for the wastewater plants of the market community was necessary.
During the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over-relations and undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
The severe rate increases led Schmidt to the fact that all three waste water plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water attack, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
For example, due to the low distribution basis, expenditure on necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have an important effect.
In addition, wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the downward calculation period, all three plants had a significant impact on rehabilitation and repair costs, not least due to their age.
The plant in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged in the waste water plant Azendorf due to a damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumpwork, the nearly 20-year-old support plants had to be overloaded from ground to ground and the Lopp pond clearing plant had to excavate the first cleaning pond after nearly 20 years of operation, disposing of cleansing mud and using an additional ventilation option to comply with water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "To these extraordinary expenses, the continued care and maintenance costs were to be taken into account accordingly during the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Stone houses made it clear that in the small wastewater attack in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance are "slashed completely".
In addition, Schmidt added, the market community had been spared of major entertainment costs in waste water plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for these plants, according to stone houses, will continue to remain precarious, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater plant could not be extended to these plants because it is deficiency facilities.
Bulgaria is booked for the first time in 8 months inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest value (since June 2012) and the first over zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were booked.
The average annual inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% measured according to the CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared with June 2016 was 101,0 %, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 %.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared with December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); recreation and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%); mobile equipment, household equipment and routine expectations (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education unchanged.
Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is unsensible to breeds.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identities in such a way that is already bound to the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be from a Roy Lightenstein painting.
The filters are unspoiled, self-consuming tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All misconducts come to the public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past, in which they were accused that the App Blackface would promote or promote white skin as a beauty page.
This week, when some users suggested a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and dull cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature of Asians - "Gelb face".
They wondered if these repeated controversy pointed to a greater problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and the resentment were widely spread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat informed that it would have deactivated the feature.
The company apologized: The filter was intended as a homage to anime caracters and not as a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who experienced Rassissmus reminded the filter of injuring clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose Tweet was widely distributed about the photos, wrote that the filter was "injurious and well said unpleasant."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the counterover of a very disgusting Asian caricature and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-looking, but that the yellow face has been drawn into the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural staircase.
The American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all keep in hand.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - which are more diverse in racial matters than their older counterparts - could rather expect to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for media, decided to delete her Snapchat account, urged others to do the same.
In an album for media and in a phone interview, she said that they believe that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the setting practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized mostly the white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hash day: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Everyhow, she has no different representation of people with other skin colors in her staff, so that they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors working there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural backgrounds of his employees, but according to one speaker, the company has recently set up a staff responsive who focuses on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu said, on her part, that she would let her snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.K.."
Military management fake ISIS Secret Service Information, Committee of the Congress
Military members of the United States Central Command changed conservative information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would allow the actual conditions on site, reported an Inquiry Committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday.
The provisional report, drawn up by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Army Committee, Secret Service Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service Analysts who reported how supervisors changed their opinions on the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"News service information, typically sent by high-ranked Centcom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism than allowed the actual conditions on site and were more constantly positive than analysis of other news services," cited the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analysis is presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives, noted.
The leading errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The ten-sided report shows detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct indication that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their pre-laws to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic state, also known as ISIL.
"With the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, opinions and statements before the Congress were much more positive than they corresponded to the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recovery Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.
Mossul, second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic state.
"After months of investigation, there is so much clear," said Mike Pompeo, Republican congress delegate from Kansas, in an opinion.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the Central Command's tops changed the service reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans launched the task force after they were told that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state.
The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations are continued.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are in progress by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.
Democracy members of the News Service Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of conservative assessments of ISIL and Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking democrat in the Committee, member of the Adam B. Schiff Representative House.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, " delayed the publication of services reports," damaged morality among analysts and "good excessively little space for different opinions."
But Mr. Schiff and the democrats indicated that they did not find any evidence of the intervention of the White House with the Centcom Analysts regarding a "determined political opinion".
The preliminary results of the convention's investigations were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which were recorded after complaints by Centcom Analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press speaker of the Pentagon, noted in an opinion that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress while the investigations of the General Inspector were still in progress.
But he also indicated that "experts sometimes have quite different opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."
The investigations have reactions beyond the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the accusations last year raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disputes of more than ten years ago, than a Centcom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government of George W. Bush, in response to the recommendations of many analysts, pretended only a small crew force in Iraq and a little time to consider the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising of the current reporting of the Islamic State.
Last year, Mr. Hooker's team, according to governmental authorities, notes that, contrary to the government’s statements, air blows against the refinery held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refinements would have operated in order to sell oil on the black market.
However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the Legislatives for his excessively positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The United States wins the fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with the UK stands ahead
One day after she had shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.
Five gates in two games should actually be a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever doing that.
"I don't know." she said.
I'm not among the people who keep their gates in memory.
However, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in the same way in their group with the British at the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unnecessary.
UK and the United States will meet together on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter finale, the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will be the first and second place each.
The first-placed will leave the strong Dutch women a little longer, leading the other group.
Whatever the game may happen on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey hit in hands for the first time at three years (their two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 years of age she became a US national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympiad in 2008, as she could not qualify for the box.
Then the year 2012 came, in which she and her team did everything wrong.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team, began to turn things to the better.
"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We've been able to rip the row completely around.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the turtle in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close area.
India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed himself surprisingly tough and held the stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and plunged the ball into the gate to provide the Americans a 2-0 guide.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the gatekeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to book a gate in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Just like Bam.
"We are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the result of the next game on Saturday.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen der Trampolin
Wherever you are, no matter how late it is, it's the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro are constant and inevitable, a shaking season between competition and pursuits.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod that is served by the armbrust protector to the swimmer as a tournament for triathleting.
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympic Games for the first time and a woman's swarm with greeves, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and well-feeling TV advertising, if he was a swimmer, tournament or even feather.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Trampolinturns.
The Olympic Flame does not illuminate any event at the same time.
Further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports, which are not generally recognized: air gun shooting, bow shooting, bathminton, taek woundo.
We will always have the swim and may rule it for a long time.
But if I should reason modestly make arguments for my particular favorite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived in the last 16 years so little that many of those I had asked did not know that it was at all a Olympic sport.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and had an athlete until 2012 who had done it until the end round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampolin jumping has a certain outer sidecharme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unexplained ear for a clown school than that for the Olympic Games.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiasm.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of its never-ending pulse - but also the grace of turning and diving, the two sports that combine it essentially.
The word "Trampolin" comes from the Spanish El Trampolin, which means as much as "Springbrett".
Striking winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost 30 feet into the air and have a number of falling movements (drews, hills and saltos), before they land on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic Programme after implementation, difficulty and "flight time".
Two-and-thirty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will encounter each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic Vector is straight.
Medal hopes must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes up to the target, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They are not only pursuing the target line or the starting wall, but also another delicious goal in the television transmission: the world or the Olympic Record.
The targeted pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to touch even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I feel tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breath.
The trampoline jumper's vector is upstairs.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she shakes off, seemingly hardless like an astronaut, goes upstairs, then downwards, then effortlessly upwards.
There is also a competition here, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves to the distance, only the dreamy, elegant removal of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games.
The qualifications and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 eastern time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00 p.m.
NBC will radiate the end rounds as part of a afternoon block on two days from 14.00.
In the middle of the Olympic Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general.
If the consciousness can only be achieved by acquiring and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. tournaments recently suggested according to The Wall Street Journal - Mr. Dooley expects his new catching emeinde to come to air.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an American ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia were opposed to violent opposition from the government.
witnesses say that during the collapse with the police, thirty protesters were killed during shooting.
Is Ethiopia breaking together?
In the last decade, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months protests against the government have shaken the country and spread into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was unbarmhartig.
Witnesses indicated that policemen shot and killed on ten unarmed demonstrators.
In circulation videos about the protests that are probably from the last or early of this year show how security men beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority now demands an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will become even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Only few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much western assistance.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has drastically improved – there is a new pendant train in the capital of Addis Abeba.
The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was nothing but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly led to the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, and dissidents have been effectively silent.
Many were sent to exile or prison, killed, or driven into the lands of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you suppress people and have no other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protests.
One generation protests.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil use to worm grip in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, the tensions ris along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this tactical, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separates such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogade, which have been forced more or less in recent years, could benefit from the turbulences and be armed again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of incense.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate through the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become increasingly frequent and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate through Internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians claimed that they gathered for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
Since Eonen, the Amharas, who come mostly from Ethiopia, have been prospering in politics and economy, while exploiting the oromos, of which many are Muslims and live in Flemish territories.
But that's what's going on.
"We are coordinating under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which make up about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in military, secret services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death of an unpublished disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.
Analysts say that he was particularly decorated in percepting early signs of dissatisfaction and using Special Representative to edit and make opponents harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analytics say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia had experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands protested against elections, which, according to analysts, seemed to have been spoiled by the government and then stole.
During the following racisms, many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in recent months and this time of retirement was relatively rapidly over.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendant train, as well as for their measurable progress in combating poverty.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal displeasure of the Ethiopian government.
And she assumes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked businesses led by Tigray and the hatred of the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.
Analytics say that the protests bring the USA and other western allies into a strange position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as the basis for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently informed that it closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in a already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin walk."
Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had been founded ISIS "Sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to scatter the last controversy that surrounds his campaign by stating that his repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been seriously meant by the "Greats" of the Islamic State Terror Group.
This clarification raised new questions on the communicating abilities of the Republican Presidential candidates, whether it is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public.
It also brings his competitors who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, to explain their own position, statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the announcement at a election event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump resigned to the claim on Thursday and in interviews, he did not really intend to indicate that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The Tweet was the contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When the conservative radio modernist Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help reduce the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama ISIS wants to destroy, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.
The last storm of criticism is falling down on Mr. Trump, while he has tried to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boringly.
Mr. Trump has already introduced Sarkasmus to his defense.
At the end of July, he made strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later explained "I meant the sarcastic."
This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then reverse as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" according to the response." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is smart enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of decoupling the sound for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has adopted a more pronounced tone, as his survey values have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with great advances in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he is more focused on the attention in the last months of his presidency campaign, Mr. Trump's scarce has brought his loyal controversy into the uncomfortable situation to him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent speakers, made great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday.
"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was questioned about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic state.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them retirement agents, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he departed the troops from Iraq.
Most of the mainstream republics try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to control the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Prior to the elections in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and challenged them to ride around on every of his words and be privileged against him.
He mocked the "arm, foolish" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!".
Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as just another evidence that he was inappropriate for the Presidential Office.
Once pushed over the price from the market, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a delicate cafe in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash that had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue Ladenfront were exaggerated.
The Soap Cherie shop, which replaced the verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of Cupcakes.
Indigenous people regretted it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is a change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and verb is now a soap business."
But if New York's change, it's new invention.
A revived verb cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same employees and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide money for a new office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with cheese and cheese and there are yarns such as caps and sucked onions.
There are natural travel shots.
The café no longer serves beer, there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady current on old stem customers.
"Many old customers have also been pushed out by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently one Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34 years old, lived in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the way.
After the verb closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was at the coffee and the culture in the verb that liked me," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if on this day she ordered a mixed Chai Tea instead of her usual Iced Coffees, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-standing and faithful customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there in front of the work and, unfortunately, always ordered the same.
"I came fourteen after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my everything ball with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients into the menu.
Today Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alters his everything ball with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said that he did not resent that the soap business took the old business room.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to produce a special soap for verb with the cold-breaded coffee of the café as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to get to her offer," said Rodriguez.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to expose it soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome.
The site also has further advantages.
A local juice place wants to fill and sell the cold-brown coffee in the bottles.
There is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building.
For many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a ancestor and said he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the local and ordering felt a new coffee like a return home.
"I had to smell this," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a rich meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascent to President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt had a flavour for refined delicates of the Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu on this day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomatoe sauce, cardiophel turf and as dessert a plummen puddding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coes' last book "Chop Suey" dealt with the Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brickman in her book "97 Orchard" tells about life in a living house at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.
Their latest cooperation, "A decent meal", which will appear in the Harper publishing on Tuesday, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelless imbis in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while coe, 57, turtle with potatoes and vegetable mix.
When the reporter ordered hackbraten, the couple found this suitable for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression.
"Real foods were very popular," said brickman.
There were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner.
Coe grinding.
"It must have laid in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and it was served freshly baked paste for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" records the ways with which the country was dealing with being no longer the Schlaraffenland.
"It was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense theme," Coe accompanied, why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as bread and cheese rolls became basic foods, which were the role of boxing as a "wonderful way to recycle food rest," noted brickman, as cooks could hide unappetitious ingredients under a crazily sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.
Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.
Incredible mixtures were tested because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction preceded taste or even healthy cuisine.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, brickless prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition on the afternoon," says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit each other.
It was typical for many of the household recipes.
As never before or since then, householders - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - driven the eating habits of the country.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "Hustain Politicians" and the challenge of transforming pamps like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a festival of the historic bites.
In particular, the reports on the government's response to the hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-mich-Kuchen-Essen-Haltung, are tasty.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he was eaten like the millions of a man from the world he became.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with Gurkensauce," said Coe.
He ate in a nearly golden dining room and wore a smoke.
He was lovely reality alien.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to record an exemplary with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hire of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs Roosevelt led to the production of the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desperate preparations."
Many of the species from the Era of Great Depression to cope with food were discarded as soon as the country got back to the legs.
The legacy lies on our continued focus on calories and food, said brickman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
When writing the book, the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of brickman's mother-in-law - for example, how she could not throw off food.
"She was really afraid of the waste of food," said Coe.
Brickman remembered, "They actually made people sick."
There was the windsack incident.
After the plates had been cleared at Eisenberg's, they and Coe drawn out a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plumming seed that President Roosevelt at lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman and added that it was a common trick to miss modest recipes a send name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone unwillingly invaded a spoon in the tight, brown glibber.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe got a success three times.
Like a can-do boyfriend, he said to his wife, "A few hacked whales would help."
Killed by bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the spell to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria.
He risked everything to save others.
Now the 30-year-old has died even in a vase bomb attack of the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group, which, according to the image newspaper, has saved nearly 60,000 people to date.
2900 Volunteers put their own lives on the risk of drawing people from bombed houses and providing first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civilian protector, showing him a 11-hour salvation of a infant from the ruins of a house, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a bright symbol in the gray of the war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said the picture, "For me this is the real Jihad."
"When I die to save life, I think God sees a martyr in me."
Shortly before Omar himself attacked, he had spoken in a video about the last bombing attacks in Syria.
The helicopters threw four fassbombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chloride.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from breath.
"We now remove the toxic remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists.
Greenlandhai: The oldest spinal animal is nearly 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually come to the surface only in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research ship.
He was born in 1624 and swims with well a 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks only grow up at 150 years.
The Greenland shark swims along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches just 1,220 meters on average.
Only when it comes to it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km/h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a seal.
However, this lifestyle characterized by slowness seems to be a patent recipe for a high age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" of a Greenlandhai, which could be 392 years old.
"Wahnsinn", commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, which means a world record for spine animals.
Although the evolution biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are being stoned.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the Eismeer off the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitzbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface only in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks accordingly.
They measured their tempo of time when they furnished six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.
These sharks still make them: In the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jaws of a young ice bear.
They may hunt sleeping animals or patroling on the ground of the ice cream and search for cadaver who torch down from higher water layers.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues were now examining 28 Greenland sharks, which between 2010 and 2013 took fishermen from Greenland or Spitzbergen as a bitch from the depth of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters was measured.
In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed.
The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s when nuclear weapons attempted greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal length of 220 centimeters, however, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from nuclear weapons attempts, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in his 2012 investigation.
All larger Greenland sharks in their lens core, however, had normal carbon-14 quantities produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark, the carbon 14 clock showed an age of 335 years, while the record hay with 502 centimeters should even be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenlandhai females won only young ones when they were longer than four meters.
Now the long-term researchers could arrange an age.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters was probably at the threshold to the maturity and his age was determined at 156 years of age, Greenland sharks are apparently allowed to grow at least one and a half centuries.
This too should be world records for spine animals at present.
The fact that such methusales live mainly in iron waters is not a coincidence.
Also the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose snake was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was captured before Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there also runs on savings flames.
So they mature later - and age slower.
In order to keep the animals warm in the cold water, they often grow particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal breaks heat.
The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than at a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as early as possible offspring," explains evolutional biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long lifetime.
Construction ground in a double pack
The Council of the Community has discussed topics around construction at the recent meeting.
With ease, the board took up the message by Mayor Robert Putz that "the marketing of the newly designated housing areas can finally begin".
After clarification of the grounds, parceling and concluding questions and the applications for measurement were made, the sale of the property in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (Binderstraße - expansion section 1) is no longer in the way for interested parties.
The municipality council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schönau are equally appealing to young families and harsh seniors.
As it was said, construction workers can immediately report in the town hall, the parcel granting of the parcels is expected to advise the municipal council in its September session.
In order also to be able to comply with requests for the establishment of other businesses, associated with the creation of jobs, the Council of the Community decided to amend the new plan for use in subsectors, which was not created in the spring of this year.
In the field of undergroundlarns, the commercial area already established there is expanded by two parcels towards state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city at Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies moving from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt is most profiting from Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's competence field of financial markets and real estate markets.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU.
The so-called EU passport has so far been sufficiently approved in the UK.
This is just using big US banks.
Several banks have already announced to move jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs at the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, the IMF, the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), unites responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the largest banks in the euro area, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority EIOPA and the ESRB Risk Council.
In Paris, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has its headquarters, but it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the note bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg has a large fund industry, but as well as Dublin, it is worse to cut off the infrastructure.
Due to the large airport, Frankfurt was much easier to reach.
The city also points with lightly available commercial properties.
"In Paris it is not so easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine are also the rents for first-class commercial real estates by 50 percent higher than at the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime.
In a ranking of Mercer's company consultancy, the city is on place seven, Luxembourg on place 19, Dublin on place 33 and Paris 37.
Even though quality of life is a question of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," the IW concludes.
London, however, would remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Brexit-Votum, the economic researchers believe.
The power conditions also speak for this: In London, according to the figures of the Landesbank Helaba worked at the end of 2015 around 1400 people in the banking industry, there were 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C Patent War with Merck
A U.S. Officer decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to reimbursement of the legal costs it has borne from the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June Gilead was liberated by a $200 million damage repayment for the violation of two patents from Merck, which was related to the Blockbuster Medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a U.S. judge discovered a pattern of misconduct by Mercks, including myides and other unethical actions.
U.S. Officer Beth Labson Freeman said in the case of the application on Thursday that Gilead has the right to declare the costs that have arisen during the defence of the case.
Merck tries to cope with Gilead, which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with hepatic disease.
The case goes back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Merck defended each other and claimed property for laboratory work that was based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead.
U.S. supported troops say that they have recovered complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State
By the US supported troops have recovered the complete control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border, after the last IS fighters in the city left it, said a speaker of the group on Friday.
The democratic forces of Syria (DKS) are currently boiling through the city after the excerpt of the remaining group of warriors who have buried themselves within the city.
They have liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held hostages by the warriors, Sharfan Darwish informed Reuters of the Manby Military Council, who was ally with the DKS.
"The city is now under perfect control, but we are doing cleaning work," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% Federal Taxes
Hillary Clinton published its tax declaration for 2015 on Friday, which issued an income of USD 10.75 million to the Presidential candidate of the Democratics and her husband and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, Clinton's USD 1 million donated for beneficial purposes, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; the former President Bill Clinton earned nearly USD 5.3 million in Redehonorary; the former Foreign Minister reported a income of USD 3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's candidate for the Vicepresidency, Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, published his tax statements for the past ten years together with his wife Anne Holton.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards on financial transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in an opinion.
In a sharp contrast, Donald Trump hides his tax declarations behind false excuses and withdrawals in respect of his previous promises.
It is common for US Presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations, although they are not obliged by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have given a tax examination by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal.
"You are on the train," wrote Clinton's electoral assistant Ian Sams on Twitter, in relation to the publication of the Presidential candidate of the Democrats.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's Special Adviser, said to CNN that he wouldn't allow Trump to publish something before the tax tests are not completed.
Trump's critics, including the Republican presidential candidate of 2012 Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises issues regarding assets, its donations to beneficial organizations, its business gestures and various other links, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already crashed on the topic and published a video on Friday on the Internet in which high-level Republican Trump urges to publish its tax declaration.
On Thursday she also addressed the topic during a speech about the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax declarations," she said to the crowd.
Politico reported that during the 1990s Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years, and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax lawyers and tax advisers who claim that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election struggle.
Clinton supports a regime named after the Milliardary and Investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska asked Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate has its seat here to exchange Trump for a meeting to exchange their tax declarations.
Buffett said that he had also been subjected to an IRS tax examination and Trump had "anxiety" before the voters and not before the tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has published tax declaration down to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, averaged an effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons tax declaration of 2015 showed that they accounted only for USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike most of the Americans.
Their main investment was a cost-effective index fund from which the Clinton's dividends and earnings of USD 109.000 taxed.

Condoms with Chilipuder, Fireworks Promote Tanzania's Elephant Protection
Nature protectors in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into people-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them that are filled with Chilipuder.
The method has proved to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, who had the idea for this years ago, has strengthened its promotion together with the US nature protection by training volunteers in villages in the northern Tanzanias, using a non-violent four-speed method to protect their homes and harvest without injuring animals.
Previously, many spies used to defend themselves.
Friday is world-elephant day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we have developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, while they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants from their fields without harming the elephants," said Honeyguide Damian Bell's Managing Director.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not scared, a so-called "Chiliwolk" is thrown.
Chilipuder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom whose end is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts up with a bowl and sprays fine dust on Chilipuder into the air.
A hug is usually already out to chase the elephant.
One last option is a procureur who shoots a golden rainy fireworks in the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No Kioskneubau am St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, the St. Goarer investment projects of commercial operators with kiss-hand are considered to be clearly capable of expanding the retail trade in the core city.
However, the City Council has now unanimously rejected the request for the reconstruction of a sales skiosion on the Rhine bank in the immediate proximity of the Rhine Balcony.
"In principle, we welcome new business operators, but at this location in an exposed position on the Rheinufer, this kiosk does not fit," said Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director crushes Berliner Hotel because Israeli choice was removed after "Arabic" call - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media storm after he had betrayed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli preferences, as it had "required" Arab guests according to one employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah", left his anger at Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the country preference list of the hotel.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to select Israel via its own Call Center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there, "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was a "deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski hotels."
The reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have required the selection to be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann.
The Israeli Ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were dismayed and dismayed by this event.
That's really awful.
The fact that this has been done in precisely this hotel chain in Germany is even more shameful.
That doesn't require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to "take the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the Internet, in which people called it a scandal.
Some undertook the Kempinski Hotel that it would have "resigned to the alleged requests of Arab guests".
"Shame you," it said in another contribution, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly discouraged all the accusations of himself and called the incident a "mistake" and "apologized" at Lanzmann, reports The mirror.
"There was never a direct instruction," Israel did not include in the Quick Election List," quoted the Süddeutsche Zeitung a spokesman of the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country preference has now been added.
Police uses tear gas & rubber floors against protesting Brazilian students
Students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of São Paulo when they gathered to demonstrate the government's reforms for the public education system.
The police put tear gas and rubber floors against the demonstrators.
The difficulties began as police officers trying to break the students apart, causing the police to use rubber floors and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their surprise about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools are closed, while 300,000 students are implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen to spray Graffitits against the provisional president Michel Temer on walls.
The recent protests took place a few days after demonstrators went to the streets in masses to support the suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been exposed by a votum of the Senate to withdraw from the office.
Trade between Russia & Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the withdrawal of sanctions, according to the Russian Ambassador in Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Teheran grew by 70.9 percent in the year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, Russian companies' interest in businesses in the country has grown strongly, the ambassador informed.
Russian companies take up existing connections with Iran, while new companies are willing to access the market.
Of course, the further development of trade is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports in Iran increased by 91.5 percent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The commercial recovery was achieved by supply of machines, land vehicles and weapons," said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Iran also reached the top 20 of the countries, with regard to the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year, are broken," he said.
At the same time, only relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the Ambassador hopes it will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd to have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses searched for: Drinking Market in Forest Burn
A robbery surgery was carried out on Thursday evening on the drinking market of Rewe XXL on the Gerberstraße Forest brown.
With the preservation of a shotgun, three darkly dressed persons who had mummed their faces demanded the release of cash from the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-coloured VW-golf.
How much money has been spent, the police aren't telling.
The offenders were supposed to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, that is, relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market and can be seen badly.
After the attack, the perpetrators must be run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled by the chotter parking area located opposite the entrance of the parkhouse with the silver-coloured car, possibly in direction B 256 (Schladernring).
Those who have made observations related to the robbery at the time of action (at 7:45 p.m.) are urged to report to the police.
Nagold: game and fun at summer leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the Social Educational Day Group/Social Group Work of the Nagold Children's Protection Association with their maintainers on their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet recreational home Hardtwäldle, the lively group was quartered during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, it went to boards with the visit of the Stringelzoo.
On the other hand, after Mulbronn, where there was a special kid's leadership in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned much about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group at the deep lake in Mulbronn, who invited to jump, swimming and planking.
Culinary children and adherents were wounded with their self-prepared body foods such as the sauren spitzle, the Seebronner Pfängel, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English-Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops, beautiful jewelry of pearls and stones was created or made of wood a Roman mill game.
Other highlights of recreation were fishing in a nearby pond, evenings at the fire and the final "colored evening".
On the day of the journey, the sun laughed, and the children and young people returned home contently.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the gate of mercy
The ministrates from the Seal Care Unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were travelling on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Four stages were managed together.
In order to bridge the time to the next Romwall ride of all ministrants in anticipated two years, St. Anna’s Oberministerrunde decided to prepare and implement a multi-day pilgrimage.
Several pilgrimage goals were examined and finally decided for the Bishopsstadt Freiburg, where this year, during the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage goal was offered at the opening gate of mercy at the Freiburger Münster.
16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and saints made themselves on the way.
The evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims out in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrimage.
From Horb was driven by train at the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster Our dear wife stands and thus the pilgrimage route of Münster was taken.
The individual day tours were surrounded by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scripture texts each morning and evening.
But also on the way, the minis repeatedly made rest on field crosses, chapels or churches to sing a song from a pilgrim's own book.
For the nights, parishes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasteful as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day, Furtwangen went to Gütenbach.
Days afterwards, the stage was taken to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous road route, but at the time of the fluid heat, it was first necessary to climb around 500 meters of height and then again.
The reward was a common barbecue at the bathwoher in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, it went to the final stage to Freiburg.
The minis arrived in the later afternoon at the Freiburger Münster and passed through the gateway of mercy.
There was a little impulse to thank God here.
At the evening fair in Münster, the Minis of Cooperator Markus Obert arrived at the pilgrim destination were welcomed.
After service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was time for the Breisgaumetropole.
In the afternoon, it went back to Horb by train.
All participants agreed that the days were characterized by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Schotte Callum Skinner storms home when British gets gold for cycling
Schottlands Callum Skinner ran to fame last night in the men's team sprint in the Velodrome in Rio, when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his landlord Sir Chris Hoy had made himself own. The young sponsor proud of the legend when he stormed home to house a victory of New Zealand's favorites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after in March they won only a modest sixth place at the London Rail World Championships despite the withdrawal of Hoys.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the rider Jamie Staff.
They did this in time as a hind.
Hoy's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scotland that has now developed.
Hindes, Kenny - who victoryed with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner put a Olympic record in the skill rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealand countries victoryed in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was shortly back after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A strategy change made a large part of the transformation, where Hindes went in a higher corridor to slow him down and to allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they rose to the podest.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name to me.
We set up a Olympic Record in the final round and defeated the world championship.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the triumph in 2012 on the page Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he was deliberately on the track after a weak start.
He later revoked this statement and there was no opposition from England's rivals.
This time there was no such problem with such a surprising victory.
Hindes said: "It feels like the whole GB flags on the tribune like London."
We have gathered as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly from so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiade.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which was won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months that will expect us successful five days in Velodrome.
With the form Kennys it is in the area of the possibility that he repeats Hoys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean an exploit of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for the British sport; the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born).
That's what Hoy's gonna do.
Kenny next takes part in the Sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I only enjoy this for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two other gold medals, he should be be beaten as a knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four-kilometer race.
They arrived in 3:51.942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had argued with officers yesterday before the qualification when functionaries called him to measure his body size.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in the world record in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong train wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a lot of medals.
After a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio have been dropped down.
There were dramas in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the middle of sexualism and manipulation, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, when one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the legendary call of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of Portland melting demanded by repealing the Energy Treaty
The future of the aluminum melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus remove all delivery contracts, as the supplying energy company reported.
This step followed the government’s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.
Not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk in closure.
In addition, domino effects could occur, as the melting industry consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.
In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry Schmelzerei, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and lastly due to the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, who delivers the large aluminum melting industry with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, informed that it is assumed that three more owners will terminate their contracts.
The plant is located in the majority of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means a further physical demand for electricity by melting," the company informed.
AGL continued to point out that the Treaties were so-called "security operations" that should have entered into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a period of 12 months of termination so that they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue," said the power supplier.
All potential effects on revenue on AGL from GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong terminal markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL noted that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual conclusion of $ 187 million in "expectation of a termination".
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the "skill of Alcoas... to operate the melting or to ensure the supply of electricity to melting" did not impair.
The U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still guilty of an explanation why it has withdrawn from the Treaty.
Analytics warn against the possible closure of the Portland melting industry in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
In reference to the statements made by the analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts per year.
If both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [power market] market.
And it wouldn't be good for us as a power generator," he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the desired September edition of the US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and running on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, the view of this cover brought me to cry," Kendall wrote.
The revealing of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except Rob and Caitlyn's problems and in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as she forgets the cover of her sister and ends with a classic turn: they all have planned a surprise party.
This represents the cliché act almost every birthday episode of a child's mission (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon candle at a broadcasting place at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to have her other girls participated in this publicity somehow.
With regard to the Vogue's September edition, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's great sister Kim likes to beat her on the Vogue cover (they and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a magnitude that resembles an image band rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the Wälzer 615 pages advertising).
The revealing of his Coverstar is expected to be so longingly that in the past two years, images of the magazine have been passing through before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have been clearly more "reputations that models" than "models that are famous" on the cover.
Oscar prize winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even at the small chance that Ms. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breaking model" of her generation - falls to the previous category, she is in good society.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youths today who know how to rotate a good snapchat video (even if all of them apply to Jenner).
They are truly talented women in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success does not like everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world was always a little excited.
In June, the former Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized them and called them "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the message with the appearance of Jenner came out on the Vogue Cover.
But riding around the misbehaviour seems to go by the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the Vogue's September edition.
It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She makes advertising for your foundation of Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures made by her Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her leisure she's in reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people each year
More than 160,000 of the country's most need will be rejected annually by the municipal law centres, while the industry is deprived of the impact of further cuts of resources on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly older people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair delogies and similar things - are already rejected in their application for free legal advice and assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively exposed, make themselves ready for further cuts.
As of June next year, these judicial centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of Queesland James Farrell's Common Rights Centres said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already rejected each year.
Farrell said that the situation would only become worse without a withdrawal of the decision of the Federal Government.
"Queensland municipal law centres are chronically underfinanced, meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with inconspicuous and oppressive debts, families who go through separation, workers who have been unjustly dismissed - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of more needy people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Federal Lawyer-General and Federal Minister for Justice and Senators of Queensland George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need in the case of legal problems.
Last year, the national government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the municipal law centres and their client communities and that the government invests in this important work.
Donald Trump charged election campaign after employees claimed to pull weapon
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been accused of alleged inactivity after she was told that in February her campaign leader for North Carolina had directed a shotgun to a staff while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in a letter of charge filed by Vincent Bordini on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said to have waited for months that the matter would be regulated internally before he realized that "that wouldn't happen."
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, " attracted a gun, put his right point finger on the deduction, and smashed the course in Vincent's Kniekehle," said Bordini in his charge.
After complaining with the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four more people had already made the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the file.
"Waffs don't have to be fired to cause damage," said Bordini.
The prosecution comes only two days after the Republican presidential candidate triggered a rebellion when he said to a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Modification People" - gunsowners and arms friends - should take action if his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and appointed judges.
Trump's campaign made it clear that the media would have ripen his words out of the context and that he would not beat violence.
Bordini's complaint requires compensation from the campaign for violation of care and Philip for body injury and persistent mental damage.
Trump's press speaker Hope Hicks was not available for an opinion.
Trying to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news sender in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting company, innovative consulting services, were not responded.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Survey before country elections: Lose SPD and CDU
During the upcoming elections in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), significant losses for the governmental parties SPD and CDU are evident.
This led to representative surveys by the INSA opinion research institute for the "Image" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could almost continue to rule, this is not possible according to the survey values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have good chances to continue to put the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD crashed from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the survey, the party lies only nearly before the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.
The third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time on the country day.
Despite light losses, the greens resume 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) to the Schweriner Landtag.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the country day with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, in the Berlin election, the SPD would be only 23 percent (Wail 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It is still behind the greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented for the first time by 14 percent in the House of MEPs.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the entry in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
E-mail and Internet in timelength: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.
The followers dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and larger, so it wasn't good in hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clever.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution today.
A iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came to business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they are somehow from the stone age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer fair in Hannover as a "Buro in the Westentaschenformat".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicationer was to be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, even if painfully slowly.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black-white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 Euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
In August 1996, nobody could realize that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finn's cell phone division experienced an unprecedented desaster, was finally sold and dealt with to Microsoft.
The market today dominates suppliers who all came much later than Nokia.
Being always online and everywhere, that's for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple accounted for 555 million pieces alone.
The global turnover with the equipment amounts to around EUR 400 billion.
The well-running businesses of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies are also involved.
Around the smartphone, a whole industry has now developed.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007, then Apple Chief Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac world.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an internet communicator to easily use everything via touch screen.
Apple's victory began, the iPhone is still the most important product of the Group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, had the survival.
They finally disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
The legend now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung.
The smartphone is a natural 20 years after its invention.
In average, every German now looks at his cell phone 88 times a day.
"We all need to learn to dispose of the smartphone," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for staff in the Siemens Board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England has to direct the Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the greatest attraction of Heathrows, just as we did in London in 2012, when we made a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympiad brought great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new teachers, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were before us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrows enlargement is too big.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blaming on the world stage.
The twins had injustice in 2012 and they will also lie wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question he asked.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is a infrastructure project for many and not for individuals.
Enlargement is one way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion to scientific growth and leave a legacy of abilities and employment both around the airport and throughout GB.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was elected five years after the world's best airport terminal, until the T2, which was built in the middle of the two most frequent stages in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third stage, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the extension of Heathrow will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic Spirit and expand Heathrow, thereby ensuring our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in the "Katz and Mouse Game" with regard to display blocking
For companies who earn money with online advertising according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to avoid ad blocking, a "chat and mouse game".
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blockings on his desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it informed users that they could update their filters in the program to re-block advertising in the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that his desktop page would change the coding regarding its advertising ads, in order to make it difficult to detect ad blockings the detection of what part of the site is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it found a new way to handle the new codes.
In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of hin-and-her war between the ad-blocking Open Source Community and the rear has been in progress since the invention of adblockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how worrying advertisers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, according to a last year study by Pagefair and Adobe, about 200 million people use adblockers; almost four times as much as 2013.
With 1.03 billion active users every day accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes 84 percent of the Facebook advertising revenues.
The company has taken it to advertisers on Desktop PCs, since mobile advertisers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and instagram, a speaker informed.
Advertising on Desktop PCs represents a sufficiently large share of revenue, so that Facebook makes the investment of such a step worthwhile.
On Tuesday, Facebook informed that it would update its "advertising preferences tool" to have more control over advertising targeted to the people.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks would be worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising.
"For the users this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the problem," a speaker from Facebook informed in an e-mail message.
Adblockers are a stupid means, so instead we have concentrated on developer tools such as Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Women in the event of likely suicide to Swiss highway
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call on witnesses after a woman was driven on a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday at an likely suicide of several vehicles.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Waadt shortly after midnight.
A woman sat on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, said the police in Waadt.
It is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 wanted to kill himself by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on site.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, said the police who urged them and every witness of the incident to report.
A investigation procedure was opened which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains waiting for one of the drivers to be shown.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not drawn to responsibility.
In each of the two cases - one person running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that the drivers did not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway, as it was said in the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer of the fake killing was released after she had crossed and killed a man who was one night on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court noted that the policeman had responded to an emergency call in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unforeseen situation", said the judge.
Anyone who has further information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once inhabitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, the Venus was probably once inhabitable.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate researchers.
The model has been designed to determine whether the Venus could have been present with its hot, waterless surface and CO2 density at one time similar conditions.
Scientists have previously indicated that the slow turning of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that the Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere and still slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.
The planet probably showed more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect from rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow reversal of Venus exhibits its daily side of the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like a umbrella to protect the surface from a large part of the sun heat.
The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the earth today.
The model produced a story of Venus, similar to evolution, presumed by planet researchers.
Although she was probably occupied, the Venus -- over several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans diluted and its water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.
When her hydrogens escaped, only one thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy retires as a trainer of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche and led to too low co-determination law in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new trainer.
"In the last three years, I have fulfilled my duties as a chief trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations of Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and certainty," said Roy, a 50-year-old.
I have been thinking long and much about how I could improve this team in order to give him more depth, which it needs and bring it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly tailored to that of the organization.
He must also have a right to co-determinate decisions that influence the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who had hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick has informed me about this decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was awarded as the best trainer of the League during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and to the first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the playoffs of Minnesota and missed the following season in each of the two last years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 brand in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot at the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame Torwart, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers will resume conversations, strike out
Working fights for the remuneration of North Sea oil workers are exposed, while all the parties are on the table for a new round of discussions, the negotiating leader said.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil field service provider were performed sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group as well as the Units and RMT trade unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute," says a common statement.
We will hold some full-day meetings in the next weeks, which will begin at the beginning of next year to reconcile the problems.
The trade unions said that their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage reductions of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has reduced the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year because of negative market pressure.
The rate reduction of the company follows a 10- percent decline for Onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional reductions give the company the necessary room to get through the market deterioration.
Shell has released thousands of people for its part and has announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries, as it rationalizes its business activities as a result of its mega-conclusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to the lower routle journey, an economic situation that has been strengthened by the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Schottish Member Dave Anderson met with workers' leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest work disputes that have been taking place in the North Sea since a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion expenditure for new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of $7 billion over the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the Plejades
The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Plejade stars.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate at different rates and in what connection the rotation periods are with the planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of an star, his age and even the history of his solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Plejades is 445 light years away from the earth.
Many stars in this starhood, created about 125 million years ago, now reach the adult age.
They're turning the fastest.
To top rotation rates these mature stars have large amounts of star winds.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognized the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun spots --.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are slowly rotating than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with larger stars of slow pirouettes rotating than smaller ones.
"In the "Ballet" of the Plejades we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.
Since the star cluster of the Plejades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare sterile qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star cluster of the Plejades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the steel rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.
It is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about how the How, When and Why stars slow down their rotation rates and, as a matter of fact, hang their "tance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Plejades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star occurs
The tears were faster with Alex Rodriguez than the US Baseball Star in the best days from Base to Base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will be worn against the Tampa Bay Rays a last time the tricot of his New York Yankees.
"I love this game and this team."
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," said the 14-time All-Star Game participant of the Major League Baseball (MLB).
In 2009, Rodriguez won the World Series with Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he acts as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 Homeruns, 3114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005 the Yankees created some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players show similar values in the main statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be included in the fame hall of the baseball.
Because so successful Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the square.
Already in 2009, the superstar at "ESPN" admitted to taking asylum steroids banned between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was locked for 211 participants by the end of 2014, due to a development in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is regarded as the main suspecter of having received power-promoting funds through an anti-age clinic in South Florida for years.
After a dispute, the block was reduced to 162 encounters.
"The League could even have done a favor to me for the year 2014, because I've been playing 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said suffifisant at that time.
His farewell days also do not run noise.
While many baseball legends once again received the big stage in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bank.
"My job does not include a farewell tour."
"My job includes the attempt to win every game," Yankees-Coach Joe Girardi honoured.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to the actress Cameron Diaz and was told about the relationship with Popstar Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, sympathy bands of the fans of the Yankee rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the followers sang against the Rodriguez team at 4:9.
Olympia 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are the first doping cases
Arrested: Weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland cannot start in Rio because of a positive doping sample.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athletin would almost have won a medal.
Before the seventh competition day, the first official doping cases became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000 meters hiding runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight lifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively and excluded in Brazil - right before the beginning of the yet critically inclined light athletic competitions, these news come at the moment.
At Chen last Sunday, the diureticum hydrochlorothiazide was proven to be used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday the 18-year-old had placed the fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the courses of over 50 m freestyle.
Chen asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B trial and a hearing.
The National Association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation with Chen in the investigations", quoted Xinhua from a communication: "We will cooperate with the International Sports Court of CAS and will accept the judgment."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news of the positive sample at Danekowa went through, the 33-year-old went into the offensive itself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she said to the Bulgarian TV broadcaster BNT.
She is innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," said the light athletin.
According to the report, the prohibited substance is to be the EPO blood doping agent.
Danekowa was suspended provisionally, according to BNT, the B-prob was already positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Bojko Borissow immediately reported criticism to the athletin.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weight lifters from the chronic doping-loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympiager in class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the anabolic steroid nandrolon three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both dispute the intake, but both may not start in class up to 94 kg.
Before the launch of the light athletes, Danekowa is a further heavy blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The World Association IAAF had forbidden the launch of the entire Russian team to an exception because of systematic dopings, and the runaway of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In Swimming Sports, the former crimes in China also provided for severe conflicts between the athletes.
Thus, French Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympician Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pinks purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 meters of free style, I want to pass over," said Lacourt in the French radio.
Sun was also at the heart of a conflict with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping fraudors," said this one.
Sun was tested positively on the stimulant trimetazidine in 2014 at the Chinese championships, but had to sit down only a three-month block.
Dataclause: How perfide tears hackers their ransom
Programmer of Erpressungs-Malware attacks currently targeted companies - and are successful.
According to a current survey of malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies have been victims of an attack with Erpresser software at least once, partly several times over the past 12 months.
In Germany, nearly 20 percent of the companies were already targeted by ransomware printing.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the solvents required by the offenders to reuse the attacked systems and data.
The offenders specialize their erpresser software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially challenging solvent is much higher than in private users.
"We are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malicious software," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World".
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered erpression software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks took place in the past months in a terrible rapid manner.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, it aims to search for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or Database files, as well as images and video archives.
These files encrypt the Ransomware and permanently remove the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the erpressors.
To get the final encryption code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the encryption currency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, it is about sensitive customer data or project databases for companies without which production is silent.
Accordingly, the damage is higher if a Ransomware is applied.
22 percent of German companies affected reported sales losses by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activity, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical acts.
"We always say to the victims: Don't pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
However, 80 to 90 percent of the companies paying get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claims of the offenders, given the standstill in the operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, the F-Secure safety researchers have examined the user interfaces and contact with the compressors and come to the result: In fact, the offenders are trying to build a kind of customer service to gain more money.
They explain their victims by chat, how they can pay by bitcoin, set up freely accessible support sites or decode example files for nothing.
And private people are redeemed after payments from a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to recover their data unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from Ransomware expression, hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski of the antivirus provider Sophos explains: "A single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four persons.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software builder to the actual erpressers.
The previous malware kits developed by buying the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"Incorporated in delivery is a adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearances and burning can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The extortioners then search for further hackers to distribute the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log in in one of the forums in the underground, buy the set from a criminal and order another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Natively, the criminals then order spammers with distribution," explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known in many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company's IT controllers in the Malwarebytes survey trust in defense of Ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the offenders are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer sufficient threat to successful feeding, the offenders are threatening instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski.
This means that the damage potential is still much higher than before, depending on the type of data.
In the future, the offenders could also take entirely new goals on the Internet of things.
At the Hacker Conference Defcon, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostate connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the release of such a blocked heating could be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the perpetrators then block a whole manufacturing road in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and everyday
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new Jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1,60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have lots of space both in the first row and in the Fond, it doesn't work close at any point.
The materials of the interior are well processed and are pleasant, only the cockpit side falls a little down there.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room.
It is not only available for a suitcase of 453 l with high positioned and 1026 l with folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seats of the back bench can be clapped up like cinema cell and thus provide storage space, which is from the floor to the ceiling 1.24 m high.
The suitcase room can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable peugeot 2008.
The tested 1,6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 PS accelerates the HR-V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rotational ranges.
However, he is expected to do his work a little lesser.
The daily consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is delightful.
There is another motorization: a 1.5-l petroler with 96 kW/130 PS.
A all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment does not leave any wishes open in the tested top variant "Executive".
The security systems include the City emergency brake assistant (works until Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the track stop assistant.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he evaluates many obstacles as "nighing objects" when ranking.
The remote light assistant works very reliablely.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign detection and, if necessary, drossels the speed.
The full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, Navi, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI book are below the armrest and are therefore a little delicate to reach.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.
If you don't want to invest so much, you will get the petroler from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 exhaust standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Sturdy on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
For a liability could only be conceived in case of dangers typical of air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The prosecutor had broken a knee disc at the crash.
However, the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life, the court says.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
Disease: When the organizer pays
Sick holidayers get back after their trip only if the cause of the disease is doubtless to be found in the hotel.
But this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests demonstrate the same symptoms.
In the negotiated case, on the second day of their Turkey holiday, a family was severely ill with diarrhoea and vomiting.
She spent almost the whole vacation in the room.
Their disease led the holidaymakers to a defective cleaning plant that had supposedly polluted the seawater.
The family felt that the trip was inadequate - and complained against the organizer.
The applicants had no success before the court.
Although the cleaning plant was defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the applicants leave.
He had to assume that the seawater was okay until then.
So he did not violate his information obligations, the judgment.
No contaminations were found in the samples of the water.
The disease of several hotel guests - perhaps by contagion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life.
From 691 guests were only 38.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must react to terror threats at the same time.
Surely our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We won't like this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals have to leave the country faster, this increases the security and also strengthens the public's consent for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to implement the proposals until the Bundestagswahl 2017.
He also announced a further personal strengthening of security forces, "in the medium four-digit order for several years".
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must be penalized again.
Video monitoring is intended to improve, arms law is so novel that it is particularly difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet.
The most discussed obligation for doctors should be maintained according to the Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the doctoral body, he wanted to seek solutions to reduce the danger of the citizens, he said, for example, in view of psychological emergencies.
In order to counteract radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
For the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet) de Maizière plans the use of concealed investigators.
SPD Chief Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security."
It is important that the Interior Minister has made a clear stand against actionism.
"That was an ear for the scrapmakers in the CDU/CSU," said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had rejected calls from the Union after a ban on Burka and the abolition of double nationality before.
It considers a general prohibition of full deterioration to be a constitutional problem.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the Burka.
One could talk about rules such as road traffic or witnesses before court.
Green Chief Simone Peter challenged the minister to simulate action and action with always new anti-terror packages.
Left-Parteich Bernd Riexinger said: "Float Proverbs and a strengthening of the right of residence will no longer bring the people in this country security."
Better traffic flow on the motorway provider
It stands regularly on the surrounding road - here a picture of November.
But that is to change: the legal breakdown is to be extended.
This is a good news for all car drivers who are in the career on the surrounding road every evening in the stew when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
The country farm road construction extends the right award track by 700 meters on the next Tuesday and Wednesday (16./17. August) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the exit of Weseler Straße.
Car drivers can then turn right from the Hammer Street.
The great advantage: the traffic is more early, which improves the overall flow on the extensive section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU group in the district representation Münster-West.
The carriage on the transporter nerves the drivers mainly between 17 and 19 o'clock.
Working days the retirement extends to the bridge above the Albersloher road and sometimes beyond it.
The ground is the needle tube on the B 51 shortly before the exit of Weseler Straße.
From here the traffic is only single-speeded over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be rebuilt for a good quarter of years ago.
The reason: Static calculations have shown that the bridge no longer has the required load power to take on heavy loads, in particular, two-speed.
How long this narrow pass and the associated working daily stew will last, the competent national company cannot say.
However, it is expected to be years: because the bridge has an official resting time until 2034.
For the extension of the legal breakdown, the national company has deliberately selected the weaker time in school holidays because disability is expected.
The traffic will be carried by the construction site one-way on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural Travel: Culture offers for schools
The international class of the Forest School visited the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's Association and the Young Theatre are planning a music project now.
The association of Nima's allows young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Classe International" of the Forest School of Children's House has visited an imagination of the prize-winning piece "The invisible house" of the Jungen Theater Münster.
In the context of the "intercultural journey" initiated by the Verein Nima, 19 students between 11 and 15 years visited the scenery in the small house.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set up the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers the opportunity to visit schools with welcoming classes in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the classes had come to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria between September 2015 and March 2016 and talked little German.
Thanks to the choreography, the scenic images and video animations, they were able to follow the course of action, according to the Press Release of the Young Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Talel, and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming play time within a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without the background of escape and migration between 14 and 20 years should be given the opportunity to visit professionally guided courses in the fields of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in theater game and theatrical language mediation are in planning.
The project "Intercultural Travel" continues.
Given the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of star snow: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has made a strike through the invoice of the stars in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle, said the chairman of the Observatory Welzheim, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night to Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many stars in the sky.
The starships are Perseides, which are among the fastest star snaps at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which goes up in the northeast.
Relaxing night: Tips to sleep disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you'll be awake for hours, in the morning you don't think of sleep as far as we're watching.
That's all but relaxing.
After all, with such problems in good society: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of the adults have sleep disorders and more than 10 percent feel their sleep often or lastingly than not relaxing.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders express?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there can be many causes to them, stresses Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What one understands is, but the insomnia, i.e. a insomnia and a sleep-through disorder.
Especially sleeping, many people feel as insufficient or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German Hausärzteverband with practice in the Lower Saxon Varel.
What's behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Thereafter, organic, psychic or behavior-related factors can be found, but also medications.
The sleep disorder is rarely the expression of another disease.
"Very early waking is common in depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are in need of each other.
For example, if you have a band disc incident, you can lie bad, wake up every two to three hours and may begin to grudge about everyday problems and cares, give a example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
From when should you get to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are injured on the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look very different: one is defeated, tired, unsleeped, has problems with attention and concentration, is slightly irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical disorders such as stomach or headache.
In order to relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out the causes.
Treatment options include changes in behavior, cognitive behavior therapy or also medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - are in question.
There are hardly established sleeping physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of Charité University Medicine Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, contact the doctor, advises Weeß.
It can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleeping laboratory, and what happens?
For a study in the sleeping laboratory, for example, doctors recommend that snakes with atheuscians, in the event of sick day fatigue, in sleeping, or if they do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, Fietze explains.
You don't have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normal.
"Don't just make lunch sleep," says Fietze.
After the wiring, you go to bed at his normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear a nose glass, a chest belt and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeper.
How can affected people cope with the problems?
There are quite many screws that can be used for better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleeping and staying times, not too long in bed, not sleeping on the day, not watching TV for sleeping, avoiding alcohol and not watching the clock at night - then one starts to expect immediately, and that is not at all beneficial.
What the jungle camp has to have with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimer Markus Deabler has expressed himself by Facebook as a disappointing cut-off of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had collected gold at the short-country World Championships in Doha for the first time and at the same time set up his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deabler has been protecting himself from his ex-team colleagues in criticism via Facebook.
"In a country where a Olympician gets a premium of 20,000€ and a jungle king of 150,000€ should no one wonder about missing medals," wrote the 26-year-old on Friday on his Facebook page.
The promotion system in swimming sports is bad, but doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that do much and do not look at them so closely or even operate them.
"I don't say that the controls should be stopped here," he continued.
If he had to start a comeback, he would have to be reported more than nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA).
This is the same way that we should keep it with countries.
"Whoever cannot be controlled by independent controls of the WADA/FINA for a certain time before WM/OS shall not be allowed to participate," the choosing hamburger, who now operates an ice section.
Airport: Bands of luggage thieves arrested
Professional Diebe at Düsseldorf Airport
The Dusseldorf Police civilians reached the arrest of two women and two men from 50 to 61 years of age on Thursday.
The deceit suspects had committed several pockets and luggage thefts as bands.
At 21.30 p.m., civilian officials in the Dusseldorf Airport reestablished a band known to the police from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several offences since mid-July this year and had been joint, working and particularly professional.
The specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four deeds to the thieves who had been entered into Germany for the purpose of committing criminal offences.
A total of over 15,000 euros had been spent.
Old buildings, a few Lindenbäumchen, between the rest of the headstone plaster: The Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not work this way at first sight, but the police counts it among the "hazardous places" of the city.
If you go along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted children's garden and a organic shop.
At the facade of a gray house, someone has sprayed "hash!".
Against a member who will soon be demolished, it will already be built: A house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments will be created here until 2017.
However, articles about this "third district", as the responsible property company Friedrichshain calls, are preferred in recent weeks with burning cars.
Reason is the house with number 94: it was once occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Interior Senator Henkel had repeatedly expressed a harsh approach by the police against the project, called the area "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
On June 22, after the spaces on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been cleared with 300 police officers, the police patroled official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, blocked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.
At the same time, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown house owners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court decided that the remembrance had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers moved under the jubilee of sympathisans and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the stroll in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and children's gardens.
Left violence is not the main care of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, is especially generic from the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern for rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wished a majority of police protection against vandalizing left.
The grave that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house owners and their neighbors seems to exist not.
Friedrichshain in East Berlin was actually a traditional worker quarter, which has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city today.
In 1990, many houses were occupied in the former DDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer street near Riga.
While the Mainzer had been allowed under large police command in a straight road slaughter, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and are partly still inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and electoral advisers from all over the world: now, residents from the DDR times and former householders share their Kiez.
This is also noticeable in the rentals, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 in the case of new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in the Rigas are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognized on thrown discs or freshly painted facades that were thrown with colour bags.
No other road was mentioned this year so often along with the words "left autonomous violence".
One reason for not all neighbors seeing this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as infringement of the body are almost exclusively directed against policemen.
Most of the criminal offences constitute damages, which tend to meet the new buildings and freshly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rental house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no mention of uncertainty.
As for violence, it is compelling: people in 94 are their neighbors who were certainly not.
Also, the famous burning cars in Riga have no longer existed.
For the architect who has studied, her road is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you can help each other, live together on the street and get more of one another than else."
Neugebauer has deliberately moved into Riga's street - and remained.
That is why it was so important for the residents to get back their roads: from the police, politics and media, all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as new buildings, the road continues to take them away: through visionless new buildings in former building gaps that penetrate the old inhabitants.
"That's, in the end, property dwellings that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well inhabited," she says.
"I can't endorse law and destruction at all."
But what do you want to do if someone never listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including with the police and the residents.
For those who are angry with color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
If you move, you should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a peanut, there can be bad complaints about noise.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new refugee officer
Annika Deuschle is the contact partner in the field of integration and organisation.
In addition, she is a social worker on site.
Since July Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach.
The social pedagogine supports the team of the administration of Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact partner for all stakeholders: refugees, working groups of refugees, administrations, authorities and who else mixes.
Regine Customer from the working circle suggests that the honourable Members are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-legend Wollmilchsau, which has primarily a problem.
Thus, some - less mocking than rather targeting the many desired areas of tasks - had meant than the administration wanted to call out the body.
An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-standing experience in social work, became a self-legend woll milksau.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it concerns organization, work with people on site and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50- percent stake for three years.
"It was the highest time," says Regine Kunde that Annika Deuschle supports honourable and principal actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.
Soon new containers are in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must house the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.
The cost of building, rent or renovation of these accommodations must bear the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work until now, it is dependent on private apartments, says Deuschle.
Therefore, public apartments need to be exposed, as it is so beautiful.
So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.
But it's not done only with apartments.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, there are internships, training centres, schools, one-Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be found or established.
"More places would be good," Regine Customer reports.
Many work in the Bauhof or help house masters, do non-profit work - and this is motivated and very decent, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is "no employment therapy".
However, activity does not mean only work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People must develop a feeling of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So government and honourable Members also enter here.
It is central that refugees feel that they are desired and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They must explain to refugees that it is just time and that they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he could not help anybody in Urbach, may not work and be unnecessary, he will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problems, Kunde honestly says, "Leute, with whom nothing is going. Therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others.
All of this is already a "mammut's job".
A difficult question: Do the two fear of radicalization after the latest events, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some might call naive." A residual risk could and would not exclude it.
Well, the helpers are aware.
These incidents are also subject to refugees.
They'd be afraid that the assassins would put them in a completely disgusting way.
"You want to show that they have nothing to do with this," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So the main and honourable officials on site and in the region have to look out for activities.
They always have in the background that soon a new burst of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, policy is shy.
Actually, it is unfair to put them on site.
"In Urbach we haven't arrived where we wanted," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already exposed to sensible integration of the previous people.
These are around 100 people, mostly young men.
But if people are in need, they need to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: Helicopters searched for inbreakers
The police helicopter flew out for about an hour of different areas - without success.
On Friday morning at 8.50 a.m., two unknown men were violently invaded into a apartment in a multi-family house in the Lindenweg.
