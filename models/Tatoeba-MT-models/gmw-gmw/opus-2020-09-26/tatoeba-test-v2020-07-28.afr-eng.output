He needs water.
Birds drink water.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom never cooks.
How many pens do you have?
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk declared the Turkish Republic in 1922.
His silence surprised me.
It's just not worth the effort.
We arrived a little late.
No one is going to care.

Are you sure you want me to help you with your homework?
The package weighs more than one pound.

Does Tom know about Mary?
I'll be here when you come back.
When does Tom eat breakfast?
You have wine.
I forgot him cleanly.
The horse is in the forest.
More coffee, please.
Who is that woman?
I'll accept your offer.
Do you understand what he says?
My wife is a vegetarian.
Where does Tom eat breakfast?
We carried out that plan.
You must have attended the meeting.
Can you read my letter and correct the mistakes, if there is.
My conscience bothers me.
Many homes were washed away with the flood.
Why should I care about them?
Does your friend love tea?
I had to rent a car.
What should I do about her?
If a sick man folds a thousand paper cranes, her wish will become true.
Tom forgot them cleanly.
Don't be late for the train.
If you find something you're good with and what you enjoy, it's a wonderful thing.

If the idiots were to compete, you would come second because you were too dull to come first.
I wouldn't be surprised if Tom hadn't come.
I don't want to remember.
Blit fast!
They are in the library.
Tom better didn't do that.
She's very beautiful.
I don't want to meet her.
I don't know where we'll end.

It's life.
I couldn't stop Tom.
He did not feel sorry for me.
What is your favorite winter sports?
The girl in the blue coat is my daughter.
Our teacher started singing a song well.
We are not going to eat everything.

We decided not to release them.
Can I get a coffee for the road?
I met your girl.

Do you know anything about them?
Where is the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I'm drinking tea.
I was sorry to hear about him.
I'll let you go back to work.
I'm not going to be tired of doing so.
All we can think is real, but what really is real is the real question.
I am now in Norway.

I won't be able to help you.
No one tells me what to do.

Please go faster.
Where is the PowerPoint offer you promised me?
I don't want to lie.
One day, the United States will prefer a woman as president for the first time, and there will be joy over the long-expected event.

There are fifty members in this club.
I received letters from a person I had never met.

I'm in a play.
Do not believe everything people tell you.
I don't speak well enough French!
I'm not going to come to visit for a while.
I don't want to be late.
There was a cat on the table.
It was a moist, rough summer day at the end of June.
Why will I lie?
Go in.
I'm going back to my office.
I'm not talking Japanese.
I am also unemployed.
Can I overcome later?
Tom was very tolerant.
I have to go.
Tom won't care.
Sami had repaired it last week.
What should we do to him?
The food is right.
I dress my socks in a jap trap.
Tom continued trying.
Tom will not risk it.

I saw you last night.
I don't see anything.

Do not waste your money by buying things you do not need.
Congratulations!
Tom told me to do so.
She had a house at the sea.

We know each other quite well.
Thank you very much!
She looked beautiful.
All of us are going.
Open your mouth!
It depends on the weather.
He speaks not only French, he also speaks Spanish.
I went back to my seat.
Close the door behind you if you leave the room.
There's always something to do.
I'm going to be on the next bus.
Money cannot buy happiness.
Who said that?
Your name is first listed in the list.
Is it necessary?
Can you wait so long?
Have you been busy last night?
Sami hates talking about money.
My sister is beautiful.
With the sun down, they left their work.
Who knows where Tom was born?
She runs.

I'll have to come back to you.
Tom will stay for three days.
I wouldn't be surprised.
This rains.
In the past, the boys were taught to defend themselves while they were very young.
Tom would never have.
There's a bird here.
Wait, don't shoot!
I wouldn't blame Tom.
That was his decision.
I didn’t really want to win.
I'm no longer afraid.
I hoped we could become friends.

He does not like traveling by plane.

His music is known.
It's all yours.
He belongs to the Catholic faith.
I don't want to go home.
I don't want to see you.
Tom was disturbed by the direction of his thoughts.
I'm not going to change my choice no matter what you say.
That is quite normal.
I love your son.
Tom won't appear at all.
I must have imagined myself.
Let us practice.
It was difficult for him to hide his pride, which he felt after his success .
I want to know who broke this window.
Tom said that he had not kissed Mary.
The bell sounds.
I can't get out of this cell.
I have no time for you.
They said they had always done so.
My boss was satisfied with what I had done.
I'm a friend of Robert.
I want to be her friend.
Don't move.
I heard about him.
Peter loves Jane.
I remember hearing about her.
Tom wants to spend time with me.

Are you a girl or a boy?
Mike has two girls.
Let's wait until he comes.

That's what you get!
Tom's going to die?
A dog ran after the cat.
I also kissed Tom.
Why not join us for dinner tonight?
It's a horse.

You're not a dog.
What would you have done if you were in my place?
I'll be right behind you.
Tom went back to his car and took a flashlight.
I think I might be out of a job.
I told Tom I'll be now.
My son still believes in Christmas Father.
I hate driving.
Sami must wait a little.
Are they friends?
Tom knows everything about them.
It is dangerous to enter that area on your own.
Sami did not notice this.
Do you wear gloves?
Can I shake your hand?
You don't know my father, do you?
I'm now back with refreshments.
That's why I'm here.
He's my neighbor.
Tom thought it was unfair.
The hotel looks out on the lake.
Tom’s hands were cold.
She is able to read.
It appears that he knows the secret.
Do you have a cell phone?
Mr. Mitchel gaveis that I overpaid the rest of the money before the end of the week.
She killed herself.
You're not a doctor.
I know how you felt about us.
She's younger than he.
I put it back where it belongs.
I'm taking a book.
Tom left his phone in the car.
I wouldn't be so sure.
I keep dreaming about her.
Tom did not wear socks.
Tom will say no.
I'm a fireman.
There are islands in the sea.
Where is it now?
We are not very hungry yet.
There is probably a easy solution for your problem.
I totally forgot about her.
We need to start doing so.
Living in Japan is expensive.
I know how you feel about her.
I drank two cups of coffee.
I forgot her clean.
Tom dog that it was unfair.
I don't want to marry.
I care about him.
Tom may die.
If you get up, he will be studying.
I've got a dry skin.
We are his sons.
Birds are beautiful.
The fighting lasted for a week.
When did you last laugh?
Tom's not going to talk today.
Why did you join the army?
I wouldn't blame you.
Flowers and trees need clean air and fresh water.
You're too late.
What we know about health has taught us by studying diseases.
Tom sits at window reading a book.
We will not be here after 2:30.
I like eating meat.
I think we could do it by 2:30.
He was jealous of my success.
Does Tom know how to dance?
Did you call him?
He kicks me!
She reads the paper every morning.
The bakery is slowly the slaughterhouse.
Please, forgive me.
"Thank you." "You're welcome."
The food did not taste so badly.
I eat rice.
Excuse me, may I open a window?
This wall is higher than that one.
This rains.
Tom will be late.
I dare you to bridge that bridge.
I only bought a new couple of shoes.
We want it back.
The game starts tomorrow.
They can conquer their fear.
This can't be a real diamond.
Tom moved away.
Was Tom there?
My father recently returned to Japan.
This is my friend.
I know how you feel about him.
Please share my umbrella.
Tom will win you.
Can you open this door?
Her story brings back memories of my parents.
Tom is no longer going to get help from Mary.
I am saving so that I can go to Australia.
I know everything about her.
I'm to fall in love with you.
Tom and Mary are very busy.
No matter what he says, do not trust him.
You should have visited Kioto.
I got up when it was still dark.
Find out everything you can about her.
I came to talk to you.
I wonder what happened to Paul.
If God had not existed, we should have thought of him.
Can you help me with this?
We met in 2008. A year later, we married.
She's not here.
He asked my mother.
Late in autumn, when the weather was rubbish, windy and wet, and the cold could penetrate the thickest garment, especially at sea, a poor boat with only two men sailed into the sea.
At night, all cats are rough.
Stiller!
It's my house now.
A bird fly.
He arrived for 30 minutes.
He extends to an English-Japanese dictionary on the desk.
Whatsoever a man sows, he will also reap.
I wish you said that before.
I love my mother.
Tom will not object.
I'm much bigger than you are.
Tom looked closer.
I'm your father.
You will pay for it.
I've been looking for a place to stay.
Tom had a lot on his board.
Do you prefer red or white wine?
This is the next!
I want to see your boss.
He was very tired.
How do you feel about them now?
We forgot her clean.
Japan is full of beautiful cities, for example, Kyoto and Nara.
I'll make it back for dinner.
I never thought it would be so easy.
Whose books are these?
Welcome to Australia.
He found his parents.
You can eat what you want.
It's really nice!
The river flowing through Parrys is called the Seine.
I'm glad you finally came back.
