Fire removed in French chemistry
The large fire in a chemistry plant in the northern French city of Rouen, which is particularly dangerous, has been removed. This was reported to the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire was broke out in the night on Thursday. No one was injured at the incident. The firearm was in use with about 200 deletion vehicles.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainers were invited not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens stayed closed on Thursday. In the chemical plant on the bank of the Seine, additives are manufactured for lubricants. The factory belongs to the company Lubrizol of US-Milliardary Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which prescribes particularly strict safety requirements.
In the work about 400 people work. The chemistry factory has already provided for headlines in the past - for example when a leak in 2013 the methanthiol gas escaped and the environment widespreadly went to faul eggs smoke. In 2015, after an accident in operation, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flooded into the city’s waste water system.
Wife announces her job to look for 57 days for her disappeared hat
For two months a woman from Washington searched for her missing dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie was taken out of the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days were missing from the chicken's every trace - but Carole King didn't give up.
"It was terrible. I got bad," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. Then, when they returned to the hotel, Katie disappeared. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had put dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could still stay somewhere in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, "It's gone about four, four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately cracked out. Probably a loud thunder had put the dog into panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings searched for their beloved dog. But in days were weeks. "I never abandoned. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postal employee to continue their search for Katie.
"The tears flew"
57 days after Katie disappeared, Carole King got a call: A man reported and said that Katie was in his court. But when King arrived there, Katie had already disappeared again. She searched for the neighborhood and suddenly stood her hat under a tree. "I just embraced her. I didn't want to let her go," recalled King loud "Daily Inter Lake." "The tears flew. People stopped in their vehicles, rised out and embraced us. I believe the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Losses in the Federal Army: Machine weapons disappear squeezelessly
Friday, 27 September 2019
Six machine weapons of type MG3 have still disappeared.
In recent years, the Federal Army has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of shots of ammunition. Among them are three machine weapons. In most cases the retirement is unclear. The opposition speaks of a "angry" scale.
At the Federal Army, weapons and ammunitions have disappeared again and again – many of them have so far been unsuccessful. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has booked the loss of 39 weapons, 39 arms parts, and almost 20,000 shots ammunition. This is the result of a list of the Federal Defense Ministry of Germany's editorial network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defense State Secretary Peter Tauber from the CDU, two weapons, one arms part and 3474 shot ammunition have so far been reappeared. The weapons and arms still disappeared are among other things six type MG3 machine guns, eleven type G3 guns, four type G36 weapons, six signal weapons and two type P8 pistoles. In addition, 30 type MG3 weapons are missing.
The volume of weapons and munition losses in the Federal Army was "angry," said the Left-Bundestagsabgeordnete Martina Renner. This was all the more so since in the course of investigations had hardly been found again. The Left Politician spoke of a "drough balance". Racinger criticized that the listing was unapproved of whether under the disappeared ammunition the one was found in connection with the investigations against the underterror suspected German military officer Franco A. "And that although a supporter of Franco A. was recently condemned for the possession of this ammunition," said Renner.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian harbor
More than two months after its adoption by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of the city of Bandar Abbas today. As ship observation data of Refinative showed, the tanker was moving and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was indicated as destination port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released by the Iranian government on Monday, but first he remained in Iranian waters. The shipowner said that one wanted to wait for an official decision from Teheran.
The "Stena Impero" was imposed on 19 July by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Hormuz Sea Road under the charge of violation of security provisions. However, it was suspected that Iran responded to the controversial, temporary fixing of an Iranian oil tanker before the Gibraltar belonging to Britain.
The Hormuz road is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil export is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been enormously sharpened over the past few months. The tradeship has been moved into the conflict between the USA and Iran. There were several incidents with tankers and drones.
Merkel approves the courage of people in the freezing revolution
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel acknowledged the commitment of the people in the DDR who went on the road 30 years ago in the friendly revolution. In autumn 1989, courageous citizens had brought the then German regime into the Wanken, said Merkel at a festive act of the Thüringer CDU Group on the forthcoming day of German unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor reminded, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi Central. "The state security was taken the terror," she said.
Music aims at delivering records
Teslas Quarter may hold record. Despite delivery tree, there were recently losses in the electric car company.
New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car company with a view to new record numbers strongly on the stock market. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliverys," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110000 orders, it continued in Musks Rundschreiben. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the sponsorship. To this end Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked that: Teslas shares went out of trade with an added of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered more than 95000 cars, thus reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records in order to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver up to 360000 to 400000 cars. In the current and coming quarter years, six-digit numbers are required. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Puzzles solved: That's why we can't knit ourselves.
A type of brake in the big brain prevents people from knitting themselves. This was found by scientists at the Humboldt University in Berlin, using experiments to rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress was also made in the question of why children are so harsh against the kitzeln, just to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why the approach of a knitting hand triggers laughing before touching. This lies on a deep layer in the big brain, which already causes laughing at the expectation of kitzeln.
According to previous research, rats have shown that when they are knitted by humans, they respond with "smile" in the ultrasound area. This "smile" is conveyed by the part of the large brain ring which serves the central processing of haptic perception.
Lachen is suppressed during self-contamination
To date, it has been assumed that the brain could distinguish between self-consolation and touch by others – so people cannot knit themselves. However, the Berlin researchers have now found in the experiments at the rats that the laughter and the activity of the area of the big brain are suppressed during a self-beat. This is also the case when living creatures are cleaning themselves. During the foreign touch and kittle by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the pulse was strengthened to laugh.
However, if the self-consolation and touch of others at the same time, the laughter should also be suppressed. This indicates that the rat's brain could not be distinguished between self-attacking and touching by others. The new findings suggested that people cannot knit themselves because the self-attachment activates a brake in the whole brain.
The rats were also trained to knit themselves. Thus, sometimes in the experiment, they broke off this initiation prematurely, showed escape behavior or terror. This ambivalence is similar to the behaviour of the children. The ambivalence of the kitzeln is a behavioural reaction that is similar to rats and humans.
Disastered: Great fire deleted in French chemistry
The large fire in a chemical plant that is particularly dangerous in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. This informed the prefecture of the Normandy of the news agency AFP on Friday. The fire was broken in the night until Thursday.
According to public authorities, no health hazardous substances should be excluded. The samples taken give no reason to worry, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said on Friday morning at a press conference. No one was injured in the incident. The firearm was employed with about 200 deletion vehicles.
Schools and children's gardens have been closed
Residents were called not to leave their houses. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and children's gardens stayed closed on Thursday.

Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first meeting in Parliament after revoking the compulsory break on Wednesday evening. The Prime Minister is threatening to lead the country from the EU without agreements on 31 October, but Brussels should not respond to its requests for changes to the Brexit Agreement.
The Prime Minister said about Cox, who used to stay in the European Union in the United Kingdom: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's thinking and to re-establish this country would have been to carry out the EU exit." Cox had been murdered by a legal extremist during the referendum fight in 2016.
Mahnmal to attacks of Oslo and Utöya is revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a monument is unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the iron roses) consists of some 1,000 iron rose replicas. They recall the roses that had been deposited by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dom in Oslo.
The same place is now to reveal the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and members of the victims. It is expected to open among other Kronprinz Haakon and Kronprinses Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, the legal terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first shot a car bomb in Oslo’s government district and subsequently shot dozen participants of a holiday camp of the youth organization of the Social Democratic Worker Party. 77 people were killed in total.
Iran releases British tanker
The UN general debate did not resolve the Iran conflict. But now there is a less problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran was able to steal back into sea. It could be a puzzle piece in the peace plan of the Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" held in the street of Hormus in Iran since mid-July is back into international waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on the way to Dubai, as the Stena Bulk shipping company reported.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now driving for medical investigations to Dubai, said Reedereichef Erik Hånell. By noon, the ship left the Iranian waters. "Beautiful it's over," he said to the Swedish television station SVT.
The Foreign Ministry in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a model of attempts to impair the freedom of the seas. We work with our international partners to maintain the shipping and international law," said a communication on Friday.
On 19 July, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker under the accusation to have disregarded the rules of the Sea Law in the Persian Gulf. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well according to the circumstances, said Hånell. They would have acted professionally in the face of the difficult and upsetting situation in the past ten weeks. The shipowning work now to bring them together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected that after the establishment of the "Stena Impero" a response to a similar incident in British Gibraltar was placed on the chain, at the beginning of July, a supertanker with oil from Iran, which was supposed to have been intended for Syria. According to the authorities, the delivery was infringed against EU sanctions against the war country of Syria. The British had received the reference to the ship from the USA.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Measurements, it was a exchange business to release the "Stena Impero" as a London vehement back.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important sea roads in the world. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the global oil export is shipped by the seas. The tensions in the region have been enormously sharpened over the past few months. Trade ships have been moved into the conflict between the USA and Iran. Several incidents with tankers and drones have occurred.
Under the tensions between Teheran and Washington, the nuclear conflict of both countries stands. The Americans propose the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran declines this. The US had rising from the International Atomic Agreement in 2018 alone, which would prevent Iran from building an atom bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put the leadership in Teheran under pressure with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and extended agreement. Iran has resisted the pressure so far.
Because of the dispute about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the USA is working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani had presented a plan for security and peace in the street of Hormus at the UN Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran, together with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign protection forces, wanted to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf.
India is developing a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
India would actually be predestined to be a "war winner". In view of the penal duties imposed by US President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redispose. In a survey of the UBS, India is called one of the preferred alternatives. This has, of course, not only to do with the inconvenience of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pole of young workers and a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to be creating a more important role in the globally widely branched production chain.
But now India itself has become in Trump's focus. From the Haudegen in the White House depreciatingly called "Kingdom of Customs Tariffs", America has withdrawn from the emerging country at the beginning of June the trade advantages for 2000 products. The US claims India prohibitively high duties and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the rivalry with India is of course a side view. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington link concern about China's power claims in the South Indian Ocean. In this background, an American penalty duty against India should be improbable. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just entered a second five-year term of office, should therefore weigh in security.
However, the problem lies in another place: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a heavy stand in the Socialist Republic of India. Also under modes. Its reform is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic error, which has been embroidered in the multi-popular state for too long any entrepreneurial spirit. Companies now receive faster construction permits for buildings. They benefit from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and bankrupt law creates conditions to liquidate high-debted firms more quickly.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. In India, economic optics has made much better in the first five mode years. However, in trade policy, this is not the case. The national conservative government even established new barriers to protecting internationally less competitive companies from foreign suppliers.
In the West, modes of the energetic reformer, which renews its country economically radically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister knows only too well what vocabulary Western managers like. However, in the core of the Indian First Advocate never dealt with a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to dismiss themselves of anachronistic processes and thus become fit for the global competition. Business people who survive thanks to the collapse of their industries are among the main selectors of Modi Nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and accuse this short-looking policy.
Replacement of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
According to a report, former French President Jacques Chirac is to be confiscated in Paris the next week. The former head of State will be buried on Monday at the Montparnasse cemetery in the south of the French capital, reports the news agency AFP on the Chiracs family. The funeral will take place in the narrow family circle. On Sunday a public celebration was held in the Paris invalidendom, as media reported.
The competitors wore to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the Light Athletics World Cup
The world’s top was long the goal of playing heartwarming scenes in the down cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first advance of the men over 5000 meters Jonathan Busby started to swear from Aruba. He could hardly keep 300 meters in front of the goal, ran in unhealthy position when Braima Suncar Dabo from the western African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly undershook him and pushed him back the last half stage round into the goal. However, the forces were enough to stop the running bracelet watch after the finish. As if the scene had not already been curios enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he completely unexpectedly attracted the attention of the gathered journalists. Shuggers he first got out, didn't want to talk about his hero's act at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best time and when he had noticed that this would be difficult, he wanted to help only one suffering fellow. And anyway he would be just proud to represent his country, which was invited by the World Association for the World Cup. In normal circumstances he would not even have started. "I am proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this with emphasis on the evening - and much more intense than he would have thought of it. For this hero's act will be remembered. Zumal Dabo even left his competitor Busby the precedent in the goal and voluntarily took the final place - well five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this predecessor. At the end, it had nothing to do with everything, because the busby, only with much help, was disqualified precisely to the end of the World Light Athletics Association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and studied there in Lisbon, came to set up a personal best time at the World Cup in Doha. According to official data at 18:10.87 minutes, he himself was still disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. Under 18 minutes I was already". However, only in training, there do not count best times.
Millions of Machines: Egyptians are ready for wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been strengthened in advance of possible government-critical protests. In the centre of Cairo, an increased police presence was observed on Friday. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir platform were locked.
In recent days the police had strengthened their road controls and partially searched for pedestrian phones for news and photos related to protests. Hundreds were arrested according to two non-governmental organizations.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
In Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, hundreds of participants had been protesting against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who challenged critic corruption and mismanagement. There has been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali, who made demonstrations with video messengers on Facebook, has called a "million march" in central places in the country for today's Friday. Ali demands a "Volksrevolution". Although the man is not a "good for most young Egyptians, because he is a subcontractor for the army millions, but is coming to his messages.
According to two observers groups, the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) had increased more than 1.570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) as well as the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests, which were not confirmed at first. The government also did not confirm and commented the figures.
arbitrary arrests
Many people had been "willingly arrested" "only because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time', HRW informed, under appeal to lawyers arrested. The accusations against the arrested people range from "distribution of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association" according to their lawyers. In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces were questioned and searched in uniform, but also in civil clothing, according to HRW statements also arbitrarily passers.
HRW also criticized censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government blocks in Cairo websites and online services to prevent further protests against Sisi.
Online dealers: shipping dealers should be able to spend return more easily
For online retailers, many lost packages are lost. About 20 million returnes land on the waste. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way to donate back-mailed products instead of destroying them.
Although the companies could not be liberated from the turnover tax on business donations, the Ministry explained on a question of the Green-Bundestagsfraction, on which the newspapers of the Radio Media Group reported on Friday. However, dealers could use the market value of the unrecommended returnes so low that they would not have to pay any or just a few turnover taxes.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg have determined that the German citizens would return each sixth package in orders on the Internet. Some four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the waste. They would additionally cost the companies according to current legal situation, because the financial authorities evaluate the amount of donations such as sales that would then be taxed on sales.
Green Friaction Chief Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a decision that companies cannot evaluate non-profit products accordingly and donate freely to non-profit organisations. Companies should be able to rely on not being punished for donations, not only for online trade but also for other businesses from the fashion shop to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be auctioned.
For Branczik, Banksy's work underscores "the reconstruction of the oldest parliamentary democracy in the world into the basic attitude characterized by animals and tribes". From Saturday the painting at Sotheby's in the British capital will be exhibited until it is to be auctioned on 3 October. It is estimated to be 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Museum of Bristol in the southwest of Britain, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had again exhibited the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on 29 March. On this occasion, the work called "Fragestunde" was renamed to "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The picture could change the owner for a million.
Lastly, Prime Minister Boris Johnson delivered a hard exchange with the opposition at the first meeting of the suburb after a forced break imposed by Johnson by the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Johnson wants to carry out the Brexit that has already been postponed on 31 October, if necessary without agreements with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, interferes with the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted a picture that represents a man that breaks a star of the European flag with a Meißel. The work sees thousands of truck drivers and other visitors daily on arrival to the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "spaziergang in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top advisor. Compared to the election campaign before the Brexit referendum in 2016, the current controversy is a "Space in the Park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We enjoy this. We will leave (from the EU) and we will win."
Johnson had attacked Brexit opponents in Parliament in recent days and, among other things, called "treatment" to the people. Announcements that he could put the MEPs at risk because they could become a target of murder threats, he dealt as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to leave rest is if the Members would finally respect the British decision to withdraw from the EU, and it is not surprising that the people are upset about the fact that Britain has not yet left the EU three years after the referendum.
Even the bishops of the Anglican Church called for retention on Friday. "We should speak with respect," said a statement. "And we should listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan once again asked the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the Uno Assembly.
Otherwise, a new war between the nuclear forces of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the uno-general debate in New York. "If this is going bad, one hopes the best, but is prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
India and Pakistan have led three wars since their independence from British colonial domination in 1947, two of them around the divided region of Kashmir. Both nuclear powers dominate part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August India had withdrawn the autonomy status of the Indian region and hence increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo demand the fall of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government responds with a hard hand. It has been shot on the population with a sharp ammunition, more than 2,000 arrested prisoners are in prisons with the 60,000 political prisoners already sitting there. Protesting in Egypt has never been dangerous. However, since the acquisition of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario such as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the 2011 protests was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectivelessness and the feeling of being embroidered by its own government driven millions on the road. And this is a problem that does not get the regime of el-Sisi, no matter how hard it is against counterparties. The situation has even deteriorated.
Today, each third lives under the poverty limit in Egypt. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. If you want to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket, you have to decide who he has financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also for the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stages, produces food and much more. This was already before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critical it will always be when large parts of the population have difficulty to make up a bottle of water at all.
Tüv Tests in Terminal: BER-Chef: No more "Showstopper" for Capital Airport
Two months has been studied whether the complex plant flecht works in the BER-Brandschutz interplay. The operators are satisfied with the course. However, the Tüv is not ready at the BER.
After large-scale Tüv tests in the future capital airport terminal, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is safe, said Supervisory Board director Rainer Bretschneider after a meeting of the control committee.
The airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful exam, but also said that there were still defects in the terminal. "We have many detailed topics, but we don't have a real show stop." He assured that the timetable until commissioning still holds buffer.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is no longer too large. The construction production indicator is now to be submitted to the construction office during the first quarter of 2020, at the beginning of the year it was planned for this autumn.
Hundreds of lack of power cables are still to be resolved; the Tüv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for entering the flight operation, it is still necessary to work intensively on the processing of defects," said a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about lack of evidence, less about new cables. There is no release for all the droughts to which the cable tracks hang. The airport chief expects that it will be available until the end of the year.
Furthermore, the fire protection at the transition to the station under the terminal still does not work satisfactory. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoking cuts, which, at a fire like a canvas, do not spread, so that the smoking does not spread. They have to far down. 36 engines must therefore be exchanged. Then, at the beginning of the year, there are new attempts with hot gas smoking.
Problems with fire protection and further tree defects as well as planning errors delay the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was to operate in 2011. The cost has increased from two billion to approximately 6.5 billion euros for the opening of the next year since the beginning of 2006.
Since the passenger numbers in Berlin have risen significantly since, the controllers plan to expand the airport. Therefore, it is to go at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as the President Bretschneider announced.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Financial Chief Heike Fölster switches to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, Staff Chief Manfred Bobke-von Camen retires next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on firm feet.
Chemnitz: Automatics for drugs sprinkled - Police arrests man
He needed money for drugs - and he hunted several automates in the Chemnitz city area! Now the offender finally sits in detention!
Over the past two years, the number of sprinkled cigarettes and parking bill carmates in Chemnitz and the region has risen strongly. It has created a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police caught a 33-year-old German on the civil road and on the further road in Chemnitz.
Police speaker Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations for the introduction of explosions of explosions of explosives in detention unit with particularly severe case of the theft led by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, not only confirmed this suspicion against the 33-year-olds."
Confronted with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer was now a total of eight acts.
The police speaker: "With the prey, he apparently funded his defense dependency." Only four times, between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019, the bomber had sprinkled cars on the civil road.
The total damage caused is at least EUR 60 000!
The automated bomb is now under investigation, and the police investigations against him are continuing.
It can be imagined that he was also responsible for further automatic splits in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group crumbles its strategy for the Vienna Airport. In the middle of the pricing campaign with cheap flyers such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa daughter AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna" confirmed a press speaker of Austrian Airlines to the APA on Friday. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" had reported this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa-Billigflyer Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the current seven Eurowings aircraft remain four in Vienna. This AUA takes over from January 2020 in the "Wetlease", including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg three Eurowings jets will be stationed in the future to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as charter machines to holiday destinations.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA cross and the network planning, the speaker said. The flight times should be coordinated on connecting flights. The aim is, on the one hand, to strengthen the Vienna turnover and, on the other, to expand decentralized traffic from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, these Eurowings in Vienna are only used as a "Production Company" for the AUA group sisters. Among other things, Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings device. Although the board product should be adapted to that by Austrian Airlines, the pilots and flight managers are from Eurowings. The Eurowings flights launched under AUA flight number are according to the report no longer made in terminal 1, but as the AUA in terminal 3.
After the Niki plane, a prize fight broke out at Vienna Airport. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced that the fleet in Vienna would increase to 16 planes next summer. The Irish Billigflyer sends four Ryanair Machines, including Crews, to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlease", which criticized the trade union as a transitional structure to the collective contract.
The battle announcement by Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have overwhelmed the AUA in five years, replied on Friday AUA Chairman Andreas Otto: "We stay the number one at the location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-Enkelin Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is engaged!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) should have stopped around the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the palace on Thursday.
"We are delighted to be able to announce our engagement. We both are so delighted to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married in fact," informed the British media reports in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that this will help us very much in the coming years full of love and happiness."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photographs have recorded her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also immediately published on her Instagram account.
A royal festival
The wedding will take place in 2020. More information about the date, place and everything else will announce the palace in the coming months.
But surely, the number nine of the British throne and the real estate mogul becomes a celebration similar to the wedding of Eugenie on October 12, 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy diet - there are risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. But what does a heart weakness or an attack really trigger? Hamburg researchers now want to look at the heritage of 9000 healthy and sick people.
About the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to trace more detailed the causes of cardiovascular diseases.
The research project is the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) informed on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project at EUR 12.5 million. From Switzerland are the high-birth clinic Davos, which belongs to the Foundation, and the University Hospital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diet are among the essential influential risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Genetic factors determine the risk. However, the interaction between genes and external influences is only inappropriately known. Now the scientists want to compare the complete heritage of 8000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients in the UKE University of Heart and Vessel.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease caused changes in DNA - so-called mutations - were known, it was said by the clinicum. Every year about 200 would be added.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of cardiac rhythm disorders, heart weaknesses and heart attacks. The data could also help in the research of other folk diseases, as Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of Heart and Containment Centre. New findings on the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The Chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there was a strong will to use the data for the research of other diseases. The clinic of the Davos Foundation has so far treated allergies. Now a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professorship for bioinformatics on the grounds of its commitment, the logistics operator living in Switzerland said that he had been operated in the open heart of Hamburg three years ago and was very grateful.
The bio samples of healthy participants are from Hamburgers who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 people, according to the clinic, this is the world's largest local health study. During heritage encryption, strictly respected the protection of the anonymous data, the scientists assured. It is a petabyte (1000 terabyte) on data, said Holger Moch from the University of Zurich.
According to UKE, a human heritage can be decrypted today within 24 hours. The pure cost of the property is 1300 Euros. The first gene sequence worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, has cost several hundred million euros. The study will begin on 1 October, and all 9000 samples will be analysed at the end of 2020. The first results will be expected in the following year.
Nigerian police free hundreds of maltreated boys
In Nigeria, the police freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to the evidence of residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims of some minors, as police speaker Yakubu Sabo told. "The victims were abused. Some of them indicated that they were raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught and "improved" in the Koran. Indeed, the guards were held by their teachers under "the most deceptive and most inhumane conditions", Sabo said. Some a hundred students, including children aged nine, were chained in a small room.
According to the Qur'an School, residents had been aware of repeated irregularities in the establishment for about ten years. The parents had been shocked when they were informed about the state in the Coran school, Sabo said. They had not known anything about the sufferings of their children. The operator and six employees were arrested according to police.
In the most Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They replace the often lacking state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed bands. According to the UN Refugee Fund, more than 40,000 people fled over the border in the neighbouring state of Niger over the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigeria's police free 400 children from school
Police officers in a school in northern Nigeria have released nearly 400 students from horrible conditions. "Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that indicate torture," said police speaker Yakubu Sabo in Kaduna City.
The children had been discovered in a Islamic school on Thursday, where the conditions were "human unworthy". The officials arrested the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, including boys, were kept like slaves at their school and were put in chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed poor and injured pupils in an apparently bad health condition.
World Football Choice: Further Announcements by Messis and Klopps Kür
Football "Signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa marks the best player, the best player and the best trainer of the year. For Lionel Messi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua's captain declared that he had never voted at the World Footballer's election, other countries come to the Fifa. Egypt was not rated at all - with a curious justification.
In recent years, much of the fifa has proved to be incredible: the World Cup grants, the dubiose plans of their President, Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt functionaries. The Fifa World Footballer's election has not yet been suspicious - if one deems that the voted national trainers and national team captains of the member associations often voted for sympathy rather than for objective assessment.
However, after nicaragua's captain had already complained that he had not voted at all, further injustices occur: Egypt complains that the votes of national trainers Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly visible summary of votes.
The fifa apologizes that "the signatures on the choice forms were in uppercase letters and were therefore not valid". The Egyptian Association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan's Trainer also surprised
There is also a cry from Sudan regarding the choice. While the situation in the case of Egypt is perceived, the Sudanese association states that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not vote as it was finally appreciated: with Lionel Messi in place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote was taken in the same way, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaragua's captain Juan Barrera also raised: "Don't vote for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All information on my voice is wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case, it was assumed that the Nicaraguan soccer association just voted in his name.
From the Association came the message on Friday: voted, but of course was no intention. The filled election documents were "unwittingly" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguian selection, said in a communication of the Association. However, the second captain Manuel Rosas had actually chosen. "We assume the responsibility for the administrative error," said it. Both Rosas and manship trainers Henry Duarte had voted for Messi, "also as it is in the official list of FIFAs".
The other cases now allow the fifa to examine in an investigation, but stressed that the election process was externally supervised by the advisory company PriceWaterhouseCoopers. So long Lionel Messi will remain uncontroversial winners of the World Footballer Wall - and Jürgen Klopp World Trainer of the Year.
Ukraine-Affaire: Ranghigh Republicaner proclaims official investigation
Two rank-high Republicans have spoken openly for an official investigation against the US president and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where that is from here it is determined by the facts that are identified". He wants to know more about the whistleblower affairs before action is taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the postponement of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by the enthusiasms. These showed that Trump had repeatedly asked the Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to examine the activities of the democratic president and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott said Trump Biden observed "in years".
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affairs, only few have shown discomfort. Scott's comments are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia had already turned several times against Trump's policy, such as the loosening of environmental legislation and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
As another ranking Republican, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, spoke for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," said Baker. "The right approach and responsibility for the Congress is now to examine the matter and go to the ground."
Scott and Baker, the governor of U.S. states, formally have no talk in the proceedings against Trump, which is decided at the Congress. Therefore, their statements are especially symbolic. Nevertheless, first senators of the Republicans have also expressed criticism of the situation. With Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second Chamber of Parliament, said that the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also report that among the Republicans first cracks occurred.
The affairs could be in the initiation of an official settlement procedure against Trump, the democrats in the House of Representatives have announced an investigation to this effect. They propose to him power abuse for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political advantage.
There is no exact timetable for the procedure for the termination of office. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the democrats could endeavour to impose a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on a actual official inquiry fell in the Senate, where Trump's Republicaner has the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low.
Were torturers on board of Racketes "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily and have been raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had unauthorized the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Lybian refugees on board. After severe protests and international criticism - also by Austria's Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was revoked by an Italian judge after a few days.
Now new heavy announcements against rackets are being made loud. Thus, three men who are provoked torture in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea-Watch 3" in Italy. The suspicions have been taken in a recording camp in Messina (Sicily) after migrants had recognised their tortures in Italy. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any secure information about it," said "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben Neugebauer der Deutschen Presseagentur.
In mid-September, the police said that the suspects in the North African country had raped, tortured and even murdered. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically shaken and exposed to horror - by repeated and constant physical violence," said the notice at that time.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who comes to the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passes," said Neugebauer. Torture is one of the main reasons why people flee from Libya. It is therefore quite likely that there are also offenders on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed."
Italy's former Minister for Foreign Affairs Matteo Salvini promptly asked Rackete to apologize against which aid for illegal immigration was still found in Italy.
Musk aims at delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric car company with a view to new record numbers strongly on the stock exchange.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliverys," Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks Rundschreiben. The challenge was to quickly bring the cars to the sponsorship. To this end Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible to the end of the quarter.
Investors liked that: Teslas shares went out of trade with an added of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered more than 95,000 cars, thus reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records in order to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars for six-digit numbers in the current and coming quarter years. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
US-Budgetry: Again only a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided to finance the transition until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the budgetary ceilings for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States have once again decided before the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October without expenditure plans. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision, it would have come to a shutdown on Monday midnight, a part of the Federal Government. President Trump has to enter into force the decision.
Shutdown turned off
The Federal Government will now be financed at the level and in accordance with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the financial year 2019 to be concluded on Monday. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree in time on the 12 expenditure laws, which assign the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the Federal Government cannot first of all benefit from the budget for the new financial year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio.
In the House of Representatives where they have the majority, the democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws. However, the expenditure laws reflect priorities of the Democrats, which dominated the Senate of the Republicans have little chances. The Senate also has ten of the twelve expenditure plans prepared more or less, which are hardly multiplicable.
In the Senate, the Republicans seem to try to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall, one of President Trump's great priorities. The democrats interfere with the plans of the walls and their financing, which is actually intended for other military buildings and projects. In December 2018, the dispute on the construction of the wall was escalated and led to a 35-day shutdown.
At the construction of the wall, the spirits separate themselves
At present, it is unclear how the parties want to approach this question, and more likely than an agreement with all twelve expenditure laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of transitional financing is beyond 21 November, and a shutdown is not excluded.
In the light of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree on the 12 expenditure laws in time, and the risk of shutting down thus gains ideas for automation of the process of popularity. Template S. 1877 to avoid shutdowns, the financing of the Federal Government would automatically continue at the previous year level, prevent the travel activities of Parliamentaries and retain their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are presented.
France allows artificial fertilization for reading and singles
In France, artificial fertilization is to be open to women and lesbians in the future: The Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority for a government legislative proposal, whereby all women can use in vitro fertilization, which would significantly increase the demand for anonymous seed donations.
The presentation still needs the Senate's consent. In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without father" could grow up in the future. The French Bishops' Conference is also against the renewal.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that defended health minister Agnès Buzyn as a "chance" for society. It represents the modern family in which children with only one parent or with homosexual parents are given. According to them, the cost of artificial fertilization for all women is to be borne by social insurance.
Fertilization with sperm by dead husband continued to be prohibited
The National Assembly, on the other hand, rejected an amendment which would give widows access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial fertilization is permitted "post-mortem". In Germany, in the past, there were cases where women were in vain on the release of the sperm of a deceased man. The opponents of the incident in Paris argued that a child so bears a "severely heavy fate".
Numerous members of the Government Party La République en Marche (the Republic in Move, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and opposition members had, on the other hand, expressed themselves for the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow was imposed on a "double grief" if the death of her husband remained unfulfilled.
The initiators of the now failed amendment think it is unjust that a widow can be fertilized with the sperm of an unknown, but not with that of her own partner in the future.
To date, artificial fertilization in France is only allowed for heterosexual couples who cannot bear children. They must be married or live together at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in summer that the groom feeding was still banned.
In Germany artificial fertility is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples it is often difficult.
Compensation payment for climate: Calls after flight charge for unis will be readilyer
There is a lot of flights to the universities, so the country wants to have a climate tax in the future, and the rectors say they don't have money for it. But now they are also under pressure internally.
The universities should also be limited when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Stratenschulte
The debate on a climate tax on universities and universities flights before the summer break is again in motion. After the National Rectors Conference had sceptically responded to a corresponding advance from the green-black coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint explanation, the doctorates of six bath-worth-temberg universities and a Pedagogue University for a compensation of service flights are calling for a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, it says in their opinion. The originally planned cabinet decision is still on ice because the CDU has not yet approved the presentation of the greens.
Russia again arrests North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secrecy service, the arrested persons were supposed to have fished illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. At that time there was a gun change between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered serious injuries. This time, however, there were no injuries, said it.
The Communist North Korea suffers from a chronic food shortage. The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian high-risk waters. Russia's coastal guard drives, according to its own information, to protect their marine biological resources patrols.
30,000 ink fish confiscated
30,000 ink fish were discovered and confiscated on the boats during the re-checks. In addition, three fishing and two motorboats were confiscated and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Wladivostok.
Russia's fishing authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans this year after complaints of local entrepreneurs. According to thousands of fishermen from North Korea, the media have already been arrested there this year.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries companies in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic networks forbidden in Russia. With these small creatures would also get out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be destroyed.
Next only 18.000: United States decreases asylum upper boundary
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country in the world is devastating against protective seekers: As the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington confirms, the ceiling for legal refugees is further lowered. In the future, believers and Iraqi asylum are to be given in particular threatened.
The U.S. government wants to reduce the already historically low border for the inclusion of new refugees once again. In the financial year 2020, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, up to 18,000 people are to be left into the country, as the US Foreign Ministry explained. In the nearly overseas marketing year, the limit is still 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the reception for protectives from all over the world in recent years. Under the predecessor government of Barack Obama, far higher levels of reception had been applied.
The targeted ceiling of 18,000 refugees was the lowest since the introduction of the US Refugee Programme in 1980. Nevertheless, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the USA as "the most generous and generous nation in history", a formulation that is strongly reminded of the language use of the official U.S. president.
"Responsible handling" with refugees aims to enable refugees to return to their home countries to help reconstruction there, said Trump. For his hard course in migration policy, he receives much encouragement from followers, but there is also massive criticism.
A major issue is the Mexican border, which Trump wants to lock. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump has imposed national emergency. Whether there is a timely link between the current action and current internal policy developments in the U.S. headquarters is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selenskyj affair and a potentially threatening procedure of rehabilitation.
The U.S. government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future, as well as Iraqi people who have helped the US military in the country and are therefore in danger, as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs declares, but from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be included.
The US wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "normal triangle" of Central America in other countries apply for asylum. In this context, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras Migration Agreements to prevent immigration at the US-South border to Mexico.
Court orders release of Orang-Utan from Zoo
An Orang-Utan female has been transferred to a capture station for humanaffs in the United States at the request of the Argentine jurisdiction from the former zoo of Buenos Aires. The "Sandra" born in the Rostock Zoo in 1986 was granted the rights of a "non-human person" because its release was forced. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight, but not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilometres of heavy human affairs are not able to adapt to life in the wilderness, it will live in the outskirts of the Center for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other orangutans and 31 sjimpans, among them "Bubbles", formerly pet of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before the entry into Florida, "Sandra" has to endure an approximately 40-day quarantine in the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the U.S. state of Kansas.
After her birth in Rostock, "Sandra" spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen, before she was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The process of "Sandras" in 2014 has contributed to the conversion of Buenos Aires' zoo to an ecopark. A research and educational site for the conservation of biodiversity is to be created there until 2023.
Record for Swiss extreme mountain climber: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme mountain climber Dani Arnold has succeeded a new Husarenrite at the nearly 3000 meters high Great Zinne in the Italian Alps.
Without network, double soil or other aids, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zinne in a new record time.
Clothed with jeans, T-shirt and only supported by absolute dizziness, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the rise. Thus, he subjected the old best brand by almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now record holder in the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important European north walls.
Nike benefites from new online marketing strategy
Regardless of the trade conflict with China, the US sports goods manufacturer Nike has booked a significant profit. Net profit rose in the past quarter to $1.4 billion (approximately EUR 1.3 billion). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year period, as the Group reported on Tuesday. This is especially the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor turns directly to its customers.
The turnover increased to $10.7 billion in the three-month period until the end of August. Nike sales figures increased with an added of 22 percent in China, thus profiting from Beaverton in the U.S. state of Oregon from its approach to direct the consumer via the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial Chief Andy Campion announced that Nike would continue to promote the "digital transformation" of the sports goods manufacturer with strategic investments and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors responded to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports goods manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong stadium ban on racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football professional Juan Jesus from AS Rome, the association from the capital of Italy has imposed a lifelong stadium ban on a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil had been mocked by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what you should do with such a fan. #NoToRacism. Pride to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has played at AS Rome since 2016.
The club reacted late Thursday. He reported the fan's account to Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma trailer should never visit a game of the club again, wrote the club on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian soccer. Regularly Italian fans scan racist shames against black players rivalling teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and that is very serious. You must identify the responsible and throw out of the stadiums," said Fifa President Gianni Infantino on the weekend. The occasion of the statement were racist songs at the firstliga party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florenz last Sunday.
However, there had been last discussions also on the followers of Juventus Turin. The Italian authorities have now demonstrated 38 Randalal fans of record master Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them should no longer enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed. Accordingly, the other are prohibited for four to seven years.
The fans are connected with ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra-Fan Groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are challenged, among other things, heavy pressure, money laundering and private violence. The club had taken the investigations with an advertisement last year.
Ultra leaders are supposed to be "militaryly controlled" by Italian media reports behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "controlled" the ticket trade for the fancurve and have pushed Juventus employees to get cheaper cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from generation Y?
Millennials are narcissical, the generation Z is political - whole year rounds are devised with sensible labels. If you see more precisely, the awards are full of contradictions. How well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The crabs come!" This call officially launched the crab catch at the Gucheng Lake in Gaochun on September 21, which also announced the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee department.
Gaochun, which is the southern runner of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has ideal conditions in ecological terms with a mix of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water surfaces and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
In the early 1990s, people in Gaochun began to grow crabs. In the course of the time, the crab industry has developed into a profound sector that has provided high income and became an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years Gaochun has actively endeavored to a large, ecological and scientific development of crab farming as well as a technically based crab breeding. And the city has taken care of promoting more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has promoted a reform of "the distribution of power, optimization of administration and public administration services" and has developed with care the service network for "approvals under one roof, a team for law enforcement, a network for services, a platform for credit granting". Thus, the city wants to optimize the environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun fully utilizes the advantages given on-site by connecting to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and exploits the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as a sign to settle intelligent high-end production companies, companies for biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and health sector as well as ecological agriculture companies leading in the "3+2" area. At the same time Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all areas of tourism and tourism of national importance. Gaochun has been involved in the environmental and cultural resources of the landscape of Gaochun, the state of civil service buildings and public service, the areas of "Tourism +" and "+ tourism" and the development of cultural tourism to a high quality level.
Conflict between Iran and USA: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after his return from the UN Assembly, spoke of an alleged offer from the United States to withdraw sanctions. In return, the United States had given an end to all sanctions for discussions with the Teheran leadership, explained Ruhani on its official website.
U.S. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the Iranian official on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron had been present in New York and had forced a meeting to take place. "And America says I lift the sanctions," supplemented Ruhani. The kind of penalties that should be completed have stood up to the debate. "And they clearly said that we lift all sanctions."
However, this incidence was not acceptable, criticized Ruhani. In view of the current criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. Background was the hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This is intended to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons. France’s President Emmanuel Macron had expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet at the edge of the UN Assembly with US President Donald Trump.
Heavy earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 descendants
After western Turkey was shaken by two earthquakes within the shortest time, the fear of a disaster grows. 34 people were injured during the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the preceding phenomenon there have been nearly 200 descendants, the Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. This increases concern for a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul on Thursday and caused panic in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wanted to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for shaking, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself, the late danger is repeatedly ignored. Every year, poorly built housing collapses, among other things, by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shaken Istanbul.
For years, city planners such as the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have warned that large open areas registered in the centre as refugees have long been built. Only for the 20th anniversary of the Gölcük-Beven in August, Istanbul's building engineer chamber had warned that an estimated million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicentre of the earthquake of Thursday was located in the Marmaramare district in the Silivri District and in about seven kilometres of depth, as the Afad Civil Protection Authority reported. A smaller post-square took even greater panic on the streets a few minutes later.
Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu notified on Twitter, wounded or damages were not reported at first. The state sender TRT showed people who were running panic from the houses. Students were brought out of the buildings for safety reasons in the Silivri District. Some students wept as they had seen on pictures.
Istanbul is considered particularly dangerous. Under the marmarameer is a section of the so-called North Anatolic disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Earth plate. Turkey is repeatedly shaken by earthquakes. One of the most fatal was the quake in 1999 near Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
Researchers fear that an earthquake of 7.1 to 7.4 might threaten. But when the earthquake comes, it is unclear. At the earthquake on Thursday, it already met the west of the country and Istanbul.
Companies design emergency plans, private people have completed so-called Go-Bags with all the need to be packed next doors, and schools teach children how to conduct when the earth wakes. When the next big quakes come, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after his return from New York that eight people had been injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu pursued the developments of the Istanbul Coordination Centre (Akom). According to this two minarettes of mosques crashed into the districts of Avcilar and Sariyer.
Warning of afterbeating in Istanbul
In the social networks many users report panic. Buildings wackeled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was more severe than that of Tuesday, writes a user. The head of the Turkish Red Moon, Kerem Klinik, warned by Twitter before precipitation. He called people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
According to the date of the quake, official information is given at 13.59 p.m. (local time). Only a few minutes after the first quake, according to CNN Turkey, there was a precipitation that was indicated with a thickness of 4.0 on the judge scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of thickness 4.6 shaken the Turkish marmara region - it was to feel until Istanbul. Also its epicentre was located in the Marmaramarian western of the million metropolis, the Afad Civil Protection Authority already informed on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided for headlines this Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually cause damage - and massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sükrü Ersoy expects that the earthquake is now a warning. It had become more likely, he said to CNN Türk. "This could be the signs of a larger earthquake," said Ersoy to the sender. "In the past or later the great quake will also come."
A few weeks ago there had been an incident - the quake also triggered great concerns in Istanbul. In Albania there had also only been a violent earthquake a few days ago - there were 68 injured people. Also at the Lake Constance this year, the earth had poured.
Parliament: New ignition in Ukraine
Two brilliant documents provide for new ignorance in Ukraine's office for potential abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible offence of office, the US democracies are strengthened: The complaint on Trump and its controversial phoneat with the Ukrainian president is on the basis of important evidence for investigations against the President. Trump itself sees itself more than the victims of a "hexenjagd". He also doubted the credibility of the whistleblower.
United States: United Airlines flight passenger locked in toilet - airplane redirected
Because a passenger had been imprisoned in the board toilette, a flight from United Airlines has been redirected. The WC door had been blocked during the flight from Washington to San Francisco in 1554, the airline was informed according to US media.
In the event of an unscheduled landing in Denver on Wednesday evening (local time) the woman could finally be freed from the narrow cabin. About an hour they had been imprisoned in it, U.S. media were called to other passengers. For further flight to San Francisco, the passengers had to change the machine.
In a video widespread on the Internet, which according to US media is supposed to come from flight 1554, is to see how several people try to free the woman. "We are working at the moment to open the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it. The airline has apologized at all passengers. Open was first if the woman received a compensation.
The Kakerlake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit Chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous narrative "The Conversion", British success author Ian McEwan (71) wrote a book on the Brexit Chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on 27 November, the Diogenes Publisher (Zurich). In this it is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his former life, but is now the most powerful man of Britain. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in fact and is determined to be held up by nothing and no one.
McEwan was quoted with the words: "When Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment when ministers lie as the Soviet leaders once, when Brexiteans in high positions are right to give the catastrophe of a No-Deal - then a writer must ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer to it: write". By McEwan, only in the spring of the novel "Mashines like I" appeared on artificial intelligence.
The first story published in Kafkas in 1915 is by Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and "sees himself to an enormous imbecier", is gradually excluded from family and society and finally goes underground. "Ian McEwan is necessarily necessarily in front of Kafka to describe a world standing in the head," said the Diogenic publisher.
EU invests 9.5 million euros in Austrian railway infrastructure
11.200 cars in Austria and Hungary receive fleet brakes to reduce noise load by freight trains. Furthermore, sections of the railway connections between Graz and Györ and Vienna's New Town and Sopron are modernized and electrified.
According to EU authorities, this aims to make travels more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds are from the EU infrastructure pitch "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All travels canceled until 31 October
The German travel organiser Thomas Cook has canceled all the journeys until 31 October 2019 for a day after his insolvency contract. Travel travels could be "not taken on for insolvency reasons", the company informed on Thursday evening.
This also affects bookings of Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travels, ÖGER TOURS, Bucher Travels and Air Marin, which are already paid or fully paid. As it stands for travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further approach was examined.
Thomas Cook in Germany had entered the pledge of the British Mother Group and had submitted insolvency request on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann Travels, Öger Tours and Bucher Travels, employed about 2000 people in Germany.
Insurer wants to transfer hotels immediately again money
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad, currently still hosting Thomas-Cook holidays, will receive money from the Zurich insurance. Payments to the hotels are linked according to Zurich to the condition that holidayers are no longer asked for extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without submission of separate invoices, hotels in the resorts are now to receive 50 percent of the outstanding payments, as one Zurich spokesman of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas-Cook travellers from these hotels are not promptly asked for individual payment of hotel accounts or otherwise required," said Sprecher Bernd Engelien.
Insurance therefore responded to reports from hotel guests who had been forced to pay their accommodations on site themselves. Some therefore had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centers had criticized this sharply.
How many hotels are affected, on Friday, the insolvent travel provider is voted, said the insurance speaker. According to Thursday, 70 000 Thomas-Cook-Paying vacationers were travelling from Germany. The Zurich Germany has secured holidays and returning the Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvency managers want to try to continue the three Thomas-Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payouts to hotels by the Zurich Insurance only help the travellers who are still on the way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on the holiday, it looks bad. On late Thursday evening the company informed that all travels would be canceled until 31 October. This is also true for such bookings that have already been paid.
As it stands for travel with start from 1 November 2019, the company left open. In agreement with the insolvency insurance, the further procedure was examined, said it. In principle, insurance Zurich is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new travels is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which can be represented by the Kaera company. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about possibilities of returning the travel price and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry Destroys Sprengmine in Angola
Prince Harry has been continuing the commitment of Lady Diana for a long time. In Africa, he now walks directly on the traces of his mother.
The British Prince Harry was clothed with a blue splitter vest in Angola and destroyed a spring mine.
Near a camp of the British Halo Trust at the town of Dirico, he created the ignition circle on Friday morning before running TV cameras. In a safe distance, the sponge body exploded in the Savanne landscape, without any damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades of bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1000 minefields threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his African journey, Harry wanted to walk directly in the city of Huambo on the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same champion who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to relocate the way she went. The pictures on which Princess Diana went through a spacious minefield in 1997 were all around the world. She also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day trip to Africa that has begun in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town since Monday.
Stocking Brexit negotiations: The risk of a no-deal remains acute
Actually, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly defined that there will be no guarantee of a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements are in the polarising British of eternal duration. The recent judgment of the Supreme Court in Great Britain sweves like a damocular difficulty over the Blondhead. His suspension of Parliament in order to carry out its Brexit course until the date of departure was canceled at the beginning of this week. And a law adopted by Parliament obliges Johnson to prolong the bilateral discussions in the event of failed negotiations with the EU until 31 October. However, Johnson had repeatedly ruled out categorically.
Boris Johnson still thinks deal is possible
However, the pressure does not seem to pass to Johnson. Meanwhile, when visiting a hospital, he made an indication that he supported an extension of the negotiations by the end of October in the event of an unanimity:
You know, we'll adhere to the law.
At the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
And best with a deal. I am cautiously optimistic that this works.
And the time is slowly running away from the Brexit negotiators in Brussels. The EU and the British retailers still have a period of six weeks to prevent the withdrawal of Britain from the European Union without agreements. However, the recent discussions have not yet achieved a breakthrough again. A agreement by the end of October appears more difficult to imagine. The British Prime Minister does not break the law, there is a renewal of the date of withdrawal. However, the opposition does not trust the words of the Prime Minister. It fears that Johnson could do something in the case of a No-Deal the Brexit.
U.S. authorities: Other deaths due to e-cigarettes
The number of deaths associated with the use of E-cigarettes in the USA has increased to twelve. In addition, 805 confirmed and likely injured in this context, the US Health Authority informed CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine" there were already more than 900 affected people, around 500 of them confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage is known in Europe so far. The complaints seem to be limited to users in the USA.
The fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Mohammed Ali's videos were divided millions of times in online networks. The Spanish-based builder and actor demands a "volksrevolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, whose critics are accusing corruption and misconduct. Ali hopes masses with a million participants at central places of the country.
In any event, security authorities are alarmed. In the center of Cairo there was already an increased police presence. Several metro stations remained closed, roads around the central Tahrir platform were locked. In recent days the police had strengthened their road controls and partially searched for pedestrian phones for news and photos related to protests.
On September 20, the demonstrators also gathered around the Tahrir Square.
Over the past weekend in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, there had been protests with hundreds of participants. There had not been such an open protest in Egypt for years. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), the security forces responded hardly. Since last week, almost 2,000 people were arrested. Many of them were arbitraryly arrested - only because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW was informed on appeal to lawyers.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country. Accordingly, the government blocks in Cairo websites and online services to prevent further protests against al-Sisi. The general rules the country since 2013, after he had crashed the democraticly chosen Islamist President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, opponents of government, bloggers and activists were imprisoned and partially sentenced in recent years.
"Ocean Change": Arved Fuchs by Greenland expedition back
The Polar Researcher Arved Fuchs returned from its Greenland expedition on Friday. He was welcomed on his arrival in the port of Hamburg, among other things by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg over the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fuchs has investigated and documented the consequences of warming on his sailing ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future Movement is a blessing, said the Polar Researcher. For years he has waited for the young generation to speak. For decades, it has been known that the earth is warming up. Yet many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place under exclusion of the public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform the people about the effects of the warming and confusion of the seas. Among other things, the expedition was measured by a drone greenlands glacier journey and was fished by networks for microplastics, said it.
The Polar Researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" for his "Seadevcon Award for Sustainable and Respectful Use of the World Seas" in the context of the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who are at the heart of the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the prize rental. "He is a witness of the changes that have been made in the Arctic in recent decades."
Dear Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for nodles 430 Euro
430 Euro for two plates of spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Englishburg in Rome: this seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The invoice with 80 euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the closure to Facebook, which caused hot reactions.
"These cases harm Rome's reputation. We call on the police to examine whether this is a fraud," demanded a speaker from Federagit, the association of travellers in Rome, according to the Roman daily newspaper Il Messaggero (Freitagsausgabe).
The restaurant's owners were prompted to react. The Japanese women would not only have ordered spaghetti but also fresh fish, the local owner justified themselves. However, this is not to be taken from the invoice. Also a drinking fee of up to 20 percent of the invoice is normal, said the host.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could, after the turbulent revealings of the past days, actually face an official refusal procedure, the democrats want to examine this with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - the talk is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the scandal, the phone calling with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is supposed to be public. The accusation of whistleblower, who ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint from concern about national security and democracy, is monstrous: The president has abused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for the influence of the election 2020. He has exploited Ukraine's dependency in this process and thus wants to force them to become active against a political opponent.
The core of this project is also reflected in the now published coupon of the conversation with Selenskyj, although it does not reflect the complete text. However, the 25th of July is only an episode of a much larger history, in which its center is mainly its personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes its beginning from the public view in May 2019, when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans report to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the elected president Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very precisely that his intentions are delicate. "We don't mix ourselves into a choice, we mix ourselves into an investigation for what we have the right," he says the newspaper. You might think it was unpleasant, but "there is nothing illegal". Giuliani wants to pursue investigations in Ukraine for which there is little basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful for my clients and could prove to be useful for my government."
The lawyer and former Mayor of New York seems to have infected itself with right conspiracy fantasy fixed on Trump's counter candidate at the election in 2016: Hillary Clinton had conspirated with actors in Ukraine, critics at the time said to construct an occasion for Russia's investigations in the USA. However, this accusation was never taken seriously.
It is precisely the investigations about which Trump will talk to Selenskyj on the phone in July. The version of Giulianis and the President is: The former Vice-President and presently prospective candidate for the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Joe Biden, had, as the Ukraine officer of the Obama Government, urged Wiktor Schokin to release the then Ukrainian General Prosecutor. To stop the investigation of the gas company responsible by him in whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was active.
In fact, the process was something different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian prosecutor should go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected. Schokin was also very provoked by self corrupt gestures, the US government was far from the only Western partner forced on his release. Moreover, the Obama government expressly supported investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances at Instagram and Facebook. Accordingly, Germany, the UK and Spain are particularly affected. On the website all disturbances.de users report that Facebook has not always been charged since about 15.30 p.m. Also Instagram reported the error message that content could not be loaded. Whatsapp also seems to be affected by the disorder, even if not in the same range.
Instagram and co. more often affected by disorders
It's not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July, the services were out for several hours. And as in the previous cases, users also use Twitter this time especially to make their anger air.
Polish scientists in Antarctica saved
Three Polish scientists have been saved from the Chilean Air Force from the Antarctic ice. They were travelling with a hose boat and several miles from their base when their engine failed. They had luck in calamity - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue screwer for the storage.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean air brigade:
"By 9:30 a.m. we received the message, just ten of us started, and good 20 minutes later we were over the hoseboat."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station , 19 scientists work there. The frozen researchers were surely brought back to their research station.
Attention: smartphone NOT load wirelessly
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used yet.
Since several new smartphones have finally come to the market, which support and sell themselves very well - all ahead of the new iPhone 11 models, we would like to remember a study from the beginning of July once again. Although the wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature increases battery
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. According to the univerity of Warwick's findings, this is extremely harmful to the devices. For this reason, the significantly larger heat development is. If you load a phone normally by cable, the battery heats up to 27 degrees within three hours. On the other hand, even when the smartphone is perfectly oriented on the charging pad, the cell phone has always been measured above 30 degrees. If the cell phone is somewhat next to the spine, the temperature increases even higher. In addition, the load pad's watt strength increases, which in turn drives the power consumption in the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a decisive factor. Every single degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery not only loses capacity, but also does not last so long. Thus, the lifespan is lower. Therefore, researchers recommend that the smartphone always be charged by cable. Since a battery exchange is always connected with high costs for modern smartphones, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has finally increased the cost of an battery exchange even again - and for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely comfortable: simply to place the device on an appropriate charging pad - these are already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is unfortunately charged with cable salad and tired plugfumlei. Since Qi (is for inductive energy transfer) uses a global standard, with exceptionally Apple, there are little restrictions. However, according to the researchers, the technology should only be applied in exceptional cases.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 eight thousand in six months
A Nepalesian mountain climber has, according to its own information, climbed 13 of the world's 14 highest mountains within just six months. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, informing his expedition organizer.
The former soldier wants to climb every 14 eight thousand people in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He already made international headlines: He has been a photograph of mountain climbers on Mount Everest Snake, which is in the spring.
The image of the mass-and-rank launched a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. In May, eleven climbers had died at the climb within a few days.
A problem for Purja could be the rise of the 14th thousand: Chinese authorities are currently locking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. Among other things, it is called bad weather. At the beginning of the week Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wanted to talk to China to allow him to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals is also a elephant cow, a police speaker informed on Friday. "We suspect that the elephants were poisoned."
The four cadavers were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited former rock fortress Sigiriya. According to the police speaker, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was ordered to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka, nearly 200 elephants are killed each year. The perpetrators are often farmers in which the animals had previously kept harmless. At the same time, about 50 people are killed annually by elephants. This happens mostly when the animals pull through their habitat built villages.
According to Sri Lanka, only about 7,000 elephants are still living. Theoretically, their killing is the death penalty.
Maintained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas, more than two months after its arrest by Iran. This was announced by the Bandar Abbas Maritime Office, according to the news agency IRNA. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had established the tanker under British flag on 19 July under the charge to have disregarded the rules of the sea law in the Persian Gulf.
Management of Thomas Cook in the Critics
The competent Economic Committee of the Underhouse wants to investigate the pledge of the traveller Thomas Cook. It is intended to cover the salary packages of the Management Board as well as the question of why the British Government did not have to contribute financially to the survival companies. "Our interest is to supervise in the company as well as to control by external accountants," said the Committee chairman Rachel Reeves in London. "Of course we have to do with a bad example of management greed".
According to experts, genes are overestimated in the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of genes in the intestinal risk of intestinal cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. Researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg have come to this conclusion in a current study. Other risk factors such as family nutrition habits are likely to be more difficult than before. This has consequences for calculating the individual intestinal cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists emphasize.
Elon Musk increases Tesla shares
This was written by Musk in a email to Tesla employees published on Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek". The demand is strong, so Tesla could book 110'000 orders, it continued in Musk's newsletter.
The challenge is to quickly bring the cars to the sponsorship, with the need to offer Tesla as many resources as possible at the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Teslas shares went out of trade with an added of more than six percent. The price has not increased for almost four months. In the second quarter Tesla had delivered more than 95'000 cars, thus reaching its previous best value.
Musk needs records in order to achieve its high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver up to 360'000 to 400'000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers are required in the current and next quarter of the year. Especially the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is required, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were last losses.
Will British Government deal with Brexit Act? Johnson reluctant
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson considers whether he is looking for an unregulated Brexit on the basis of the possibility of a violation of the last law adopted by Parliament. On one question he just said on Friday before journalists that his government would comply with the applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a delay of the date of withdrawal should not have been reached agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticizes this as a "Capitalisation Act" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political trembling" to avoid the law. Johnson could use a procedural trick that shifted the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit.
Johnson said he strives for a treaty with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Iran seems to drive high urean enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has increased pressure on the European Contracting Partners in the dispute about the rescue of the historic Atomic Agreement. "Leider the European States show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday at a press conference on the edge of the United Nations Assembly in New York. In case they do not stand to their promises, he presented "more steps" from the agreements of the 2015 hardly negotiated agreement.
Background is the conflict with the international agreement to prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb, which, as a counterpart, contained the commitment to normalize economic relations to Teheran. In 2018, the USA rose out of the agreement alone in order to force Iran with "maximal pressure" to change the course in the Nahost policy considered aggressively. The government of President Donald Trump wants to negotiate a new agreement with more stringent charges and is now re-establishing severe sanctions against Teheran. Iran reacted lastly with a re-establishment of Uranan enrichment in the Treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic now uses the centrifuges installed at the beginning of September with uranium or at least prepared for use. Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 other centrifuges according to IAEA.
Perhaps the Europeans were not willing to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians with the costs and burden of US sanctions alone, deemed Rohani. However, there will still be further discussions that hopefully would cause a solution.
Rohani continues to dispute Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, after an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September Germany, France and Great Britain followed the US assessment that Teheran was responsible for the attack. Originally, the Huthi rebels supported by Iran in Yemen were aware of the attack, but what the USA considered as a false confession. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani reaffirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such accusations must provide evidence for this," said Rohani. However, that would not have been the case for the European leaders in the discussions with him during the UN general debate. Instead, they would only have called for the rebels in Yemen to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met in recent days with Chancellor Angela Merkel, France's President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Before possible talks with U.S. President Trump, the far-reaching sanctions of the U.S. administration were first to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He urged the Government in Washington to redirect to a policy of "dialogion and reason".
Comet by Other Star Crossed Sun System
Astronomers are currently watching a comet from the deep of the world. This has only been achieved before. The comet allows conclusions on other solar systems.
What was at first just a suspicion is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depth of space was baptized to 2I/Borisov after its discovery and has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The far-reached comet was discovered on August 30th by the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. Follow-up observations of various observers confirmed not only that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it was not from our solar system.
After 1I/'Oumuamua of 2017, 2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object that has been seen on a flight of our solar system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get insights into a foreign solar system from the area before it gets out of sight. First observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical institute of the Canary. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is clearly above the typical speeds of objects that circle the sun," reported Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Authority in a communication.
According to the comet, the analysis is on a so-called hyperbel track that leads it out of our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reported. It is also responsible for the designation and categorization of celestial bodies. In honour of his discoverer, the interstellar swift star, which was initially led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, received the name 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name showing that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: Unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in flight. Thus, the researchers will stay for many months for investigations. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen by April 2020 with medium-sized telescopes," said Farnocchia. "Then it will only be seen by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes."
A team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already guided the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, set the diameter of the object at 2 to 16 kilometers in a first investigation. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory on Hawaii show a clear swing of the comet.
Researchers from the astrophysical institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already gained a first so-called spectrum from the interstellar swiftster that offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to those of the comets of our solar system, and that indicates that its composition must be similar," reported IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in ours, the León's colleague Javier Licandro added.
The discovery of equally two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that these objects could open a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, how often such stippvisites are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors might have a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency wants to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" at a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres from the earth. It is supposed to watch either on an unattended, fresh comet from our own solar system or on an interstellary visitor such as 1I/'Oumuamua, according to Esa Science Director.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega-Airport Daxing
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the People's People's Republic, a first passenger machine of China United Airlines is landed at the new mega airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honor for captain and crew.
By 2022, around 45 million passengers will be completed annually at the new airport, and in 2025 they will be 72 million. China's president Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestige project is also called "Seestern" because of its six-arm building structure.
The complex has four start and landing trains, which are to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system. A new subway transports passengers to the city centre of Beijings in just 20 minutes.
Already during the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly reported that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the - and much smaller - capital airport in Germany since 2006 has so far been postponed. In Beijing, however, a first passenger machine has already landed after four years.
New Overall Airplane is to fly in 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four and a half hours - of which the UK Space Agency dreams. It is possible to make this, for the 2030s of the year, flight in the overall speed of a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company develops from Oxfordshire, the U.S. sender CNN quoted the agency. "This is the technology that could definitely accomplish this," said Agency chief Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We speak of the 2030s for commissioning, and the work has already been very advanced."
In order to move forward the project, the British Space Agency wants to cooperate closely with the Australian airline. A flight from the British capital to Australian metropolis is currently about 20 hours. As a so far only surplus aircraft for passenger transport, the Concorde had covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 to the end of its operation in 2003 and used three to three and a half hours. In 2000, an accident occurred at the launch of a Concorde at the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 inmates were killed. Last year, the US aircraft builder Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop an overshoot aircraft with Nasa, the "X Plane". Virgin Galactic also has such developments in the program.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," writes Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the sound. Furthermore, such planes are also available outside the earth's atmosphere and thus enabled the "nearest generation of truly reusable raising devices".
Lunch in Washington: Trump wants to track anonymous tips in Ukraine's affairs
In Ukraine, Donald Trump wants to detect possible spots in the White House for possible abuse of power by the US president.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information," said Trump on Thursday before U.S. Employees at the United Nations in New York. The data subject is almost "a spy" and in the past one was "a little different" than today.
This was appreciated as an intimidation attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. Several US media, however, spread audio media from the speech on Friday. Democrats responded to the President's statement.
On Tuesday, the democrats of the U.S. House of Representatives had announced preparations for an official inquiry procedure against Trump. Their accusations were based primarily on the written complaint of an anonymous intelligence worker who raised serious accusations against Trump and its government centre. On great public pressure, the reporting of the advisor had been published on Thursday.
As part of his work, Whistleblower wants to have received information from several government staff, which the US president "utilizes the power of his office" in order to achieve that another country is interfering with the US-Wahl 2020 in its favour.
In the center of the announcement is a controversial phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues' office to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It concerns former businesses of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his spearslid from the Ukrainian jurisdiction. Biden lies in the race around the democratic presidential candidate for the election of 2020.
The whistleblower accused the White House with a view to the Ukraine telephony also of the confusion: leaders of government would have tried to keep the exact text version of the conversation under the ceiling. As usual, an electronic text protocol was made, but after the discussion on the instruction of lawyers from the White House, they had been removed from a database that was normally intended and stored in a specially protected system. So far, only a gross discussion protocol has been published.
The identity of the advisor is not publicly known. The New York Times reported that it was to be an employee of CIA's foreign secret service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the so-called Whistleblower has spread information from second hand that would have proved inappropriate. Therefore, there may be no tippers or spies.
Trump expressed himself in New York about those who should have played information to the Whistleblower, but displeased. The president of the U.S. Representatives House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted and complained, Trump's statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
In the House of Representatives, several investigations against Trump and its environment have been carried out for several months in various committees. In view of the Ukraine's prerogatives, democracies are now driving forward investigations with new weight to initiate a possible procedure for refusal of office against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a schedule for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee at the Representativeshaus, Adam Schiff. Trump attacked ship sharply, challenged him a false representation of things and renewed the resignation of the Committee Chairman. Trump cheats ship regularly and had already requested its withdrawal months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government workers from the security and external policy sector, who were mostly active under democratic but also under republic presidents, were able to submit a statement on Friday on the basis of the investigation initiated by the democrats for a possible administrative settlement procedure. If the accusations were true, the "scrupulous abuse of power" by Trump would be said.
There is no exact timetable for the further process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the democrats could try to achieve a so-called impeachment procedure. However, the decision on a actual official survey fell in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have the majority. The prospects for success of such a procedure are therefore low. No US president has yet been exposed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Business Council: Jobs are "smoothing"
The plans of the VW brand to further reduce the cost of production could go at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. These concerns are transforming the operating council of the automotive manufacturer. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by EUR 10 billion to EUR 2023 by EUR 2 billion, which will save EUR 500 million this year.
One key to this is the personnel costs. The "Pact of Future" negotiated between companies and operating council in 2016 already covers the degradation of 14,000 jobs alone in Germany by 2020. In principle, a job can only be degraded by the automobile manufacturer if it is proven to be no longer necessary for the activities associated with it. In addition, employment assurance is valid until 2029.
As our newspaper now learned from operating councils, however, jobs in production, which are not actually to disposition, are "smoothing" over another way - so they pass the official course. Thus, free regular bodies would often not be renewed.
In these cases, the Board of Operations has no possibility to force the restoration. Meanwhile, in many places staff who increase work contamination would increase the concerns about a gradual bleeding out of the vehicle plants. In this way, the fear that the vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. VW said only: "A adjustment of the volume of employment is done as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve".
The VW brand wants to standardize production even more globally and to control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus competitiveness. Production board Andreas Tostmann said at a manager conference in Berlin: "In unsafe times from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the USA and China, we are well advised to make ourselves crises."
There are already successes in this way: For example, this year the production costs per vehicle were to be reduced for the first time since 2013 compared to the previous year. Before journalists said Tostmann that the production time for the Gulf 8, which is to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, would be reduced by 1.1 hours. Exact figures for the production duration do not call VW, according to information from our newspaper, it is at the Golf 7 round.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg family is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter manufacture components. For Wolfsburg VW-intern the Faust rule applies that there are 800,000 cars to be built annually, so that the plant is satisfyingly profitable. In 2018, however, the load in Wolfsburg was only 700,000 vehicles - due to the zinning diesel question and the problems in the conversion to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas test methods.
However, as production board Tostmann announced last year, in Wolfsburg, one million cars are supposed to be "perspectively" from the band. This is intended to allow the bundling of the golf production in the stamp - because the work Zwickau gives the golf production through the retrofit to the location for the e-auto production.
The SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are also produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales numbers of Golf and Tiguan have recently developed. Therefore, the expectations are now resting on the Gulf 8. He is supposed to remain the bread-and-butter car of the Wolfsburgers, despite all efforts to build the e-mobility.
Forced by Voodoo to prostitution: Human dealers condemned
Young women from Nigeria have been occupied with swears, swallowed into the Ruhrgebiet, and forced to prostitute. Six suspected human dealers have to go to prison for this.
Six suspected human dealers from Nigeria were sentenced in Bochum on Friday for probation and detention sentences of up to eight years and three months. The accused women from Nigeria had swallowed young women into the Ruhrgebiet and forced to prostitute. To force their obedience, the Niger women who were elected had to leave a ritual swear in the home before a Voodoo Priest.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought over the Mediterranean with the help of Libyan Schleusers in hose boats. However, the dream of a better future was not fulfilled. In Germany, they were distributed to various boards to finish the alleged lure cost of an average of 25 000 euros. The wage was therefore completely deducted.
The defendants - four men and two women - had admitted the inclusion and subsequent distribution of young Nigerian women on boardel. "The work made women physically and psychologically difficult to create," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the judgment pronouncement. "Some were properly opposed."
The judgments are based on industrial and restrictive involvement of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, addiction and severe forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn the lasting dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the Ufo flight companion company threatened again with strikes.
If the company would not return to the negotiating table, the trade union would "notify on 14 October about the labour struggles in the LH Group", Ufo Tarif Board Daniel Flohr informed on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have refused to take the Ufo Tarifverhandlungs for months. It also concerns whether the trade union has legally terminated collective agreements at Lufthansa.
In this point, Ufo is now strengthened after a decision by the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to find that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the requests. The company confirmed the decision and examined, on the other hand, the appeal. "I think that a second court sees the matter completely different," said Ufo Board Flohr.
In August Lufthansa also filed an application to the Landesarbeitsgericht Frankfurt in order to have the status of the Ufo as a trade union legally verified. The company argued that the trade union had not set up a representative board for months and was therefore unable to complete its role as a collective partner.
A strong leadership dispute was preceded in the Sparten-Gewerkschaft, in which many members of the Board and the Advisory Board resigned, including the long-standing trade union chief Nicoley Baublies. Ufo had suspended an early vote on strikes of the cabin staff at Eurowings at the end of July due to the doubts of its leadership.
Easy entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia has not just been known as an international tourist magnet, but this is to change now. The country at the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa destinations.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia wants to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030, the number of international and local visitors would be increased to 100 million a year, the tourism commission informed.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is one-historic moment for our country," said the Chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult to access to tourists. Visas are usually only available for short business trips, religious pilgrims or visitors with members of the desert state. With the new rules, the Archconservative Kingdom hopes to increase revenue from the tourism business. According to its own statement, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two of the most important oil plants in the east of Saudi Arabia: the largest oil refinery of the country in Abkaik as well as the oil field of Churais. In the fold, national oil production drastically broke into the height, the oil price shoots. It should take several weeks until the oil production of the Kingdom again reached its old level.
Justin and Hailey Beeber sit in preparations for wedding festival
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) prepare for her wedding festival. The model posted on Thursday (local time) in her Instagram Stories several party photos, on which she can be seen in the white wedding view. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others, according to the People’s magazine, organized a young girl's departure in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colorful, including banana-printed suits on Instagram and asked his followers: "May me choose my smoke for the wedding." Media reports suggest that the promi pair wants to marry church on the next weekend.
A year ago, the beavers had given themselves the yes word in a New York standing office. There was no big festival at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently said that after initial problems, the two had found a common level: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship."
Two dead in aeroplane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people died at the crash of a small aircraft in the west of the Czech Republic. The wreck was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Mecin (Methin), the police informed. The dead were a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the crew had issued an emergency signal by GPS. The search was also a military helicopter in use. The calamity cause still needs to be determined. The crash location is about 30 kilometers south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometers northeast of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to pests, diseases, non-resident species, non-sustainable wooden stocks and urban growth are causes of threat, the IUCN World Nature Protection Union reported on Friday in Brussels. It has examined the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe. 265 of them do not occur on any other continent. 58 percent of these 265 were threatened. 66 were already at the highest level of threat and thus before extinction.
The IUCN shares endangered species into six categories: from "potentially endangered" via "highly endangered", "highly endangered", "three threatened from extinction" and "death out in nature" to "extinenced". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide than threatened.
Eberish and wild Roscastanie threatened
In Germany, Eberesh (Sorbus) was particularly threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are anyway small or by the conversion or weakening of their habitats."
Badly it also looks like the wild rose scatters. It has been considered "highest threat" to the Balkan ministrates since 2017 as "highest threat" of the IUCN scale. It has been spreading across the continent since the 1980s and has little natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Roscstania (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to less than 10,000 copies. Not taken into account in this assessment are trees in cities, parks and only.
Smoking species and moose also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists created new European red lists for weekdies, shrubs and mooses. More than a fifth of the weekdies and mooses and almost half of all smoking species are threatened, according to the IUCN. This lies mainly with the destruction of the wilderness, with dripped species, agricultural practices and climate change. Weighing animals like snails played a key role in recycling nutrients in the ground and being an important source of food for birds and other animals.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, IUCN director of the Europe Bureau. "We must limit the human impact on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquakes before Istanbul: 34 Injured Reported
During the recent earthquake in Turkey 34 people have been injured. There were no dead, according to the information. Dozens of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul had been closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice-President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were therefore damaged. Since the precedence of the earthquake, there have been nearly 200 descendants. The earthquake of strength 5.8 had shaken the Marmara region before Istanbul and caused panic in the millions of metropolises.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. In the past 20 years Turkey had not been sufficiently prepared for shaking, Istanbul's mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Istanbul is considered particularly dangerous. Under the marmarameer is a section of the so-called North Anatolic disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and the anatolian earthen plate.
One of the most severe shakings was one of 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then in Gölcük southeast of Istanbul. Over 17,000 people died.
On Tuesday a quake of thickness 4.6 shaken the region around Istanbul. The authorities called the inhabitants to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira are taking place in the mid-term show
The Latin Pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will lead the mid-term show of the next American football film Super Bowl. This was announced by the singers at Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote for a photo of themselves and Lopez. She is madly excited to stand on the super bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez said she had dreamed of taking up at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying to heaven at the mid-term show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL exists 100 years and I'm going to perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect "to show what we can do on the world's largest stage."
Shakira pointed out in an explanation that she feels honored to stand next to another artist on one of the largest stages worldwide and to represent Latinos and Latinas from the USA and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter that it was the first time that the two "Kinginnen" were standing together on one stage.
Shakira comes from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fight against sinking spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most viewed TV transmissions in the United States. Even though you have recently dropped spectators: In this February, the spectacle in the United States attracted the least spectators for more than ten years. Nevertheless, it was still nearly a hundred million people in average.
Around the mid-term show of the previous Super Bowl, there had been a precedence: in the dispute about dealing with Quarterback Colin Kaepenick, top stars such as Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to occur in the mid-term show last February. Finally, the Pop Group Maroon 5 led the mid-term show - the criticisms were little friendly.
Kaepenick, then Quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, was on his knees in the 2016/17 game time before NFL games at the National Hemisphere from protest against police force and racism. With his protest Kaepenick triggered a movement, many players took over the gestures. This ensured great excitement, US president Donald Trump attacked most African football stars sharply. Kaepenick itself has been unconnected since March 2017 and has no more NFL party. He suggests that the associations do not want to listen to him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
According to a press report, some banks are expected to be expensive for the pledge of the travel provider Thomas Cook. It threatens high depreciation on outstanding bonds and loans. This also affects credit suisse, writes the "Financial Times" in its issue of Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the credit suisses would have to make total depreciations of up to 1.8 billion British pounds (about 2 billion euros), according to the report. This has shown estimates by the consulting company AlixPartner.
The creditors of bonds would have to buy depreciation from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually depreciated should be more likely to be at the top of the bandwidths, said one expert to the paper.
The amount of the losses of creditors at the end will show itself after the insolvency procedure has ended. One of the close persons did not spray too much hope. For example, the around 40 planes of Thomas Cook in Britain are "old" and many of the real estates are in poor situations. Most of the money could be extracted with the sale of the airport slots and the brand Thomas Cook, it continued.
Rackete has supposedly brought suspected murderers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who should have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we do not have any secure information about it," said the spokesman of the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, the news agency dpa.
Other migrants had recognized the three men in Italy. They are accused of rapeing, tortured and killing people in Libya. The suspected offenders were arrested in the recording camp in the Italian Messina. New builders stressed that the refugee organizations could not verify who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete had illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on June 29th, racing a ship from the Italian financial police. The day the three suspects had also arrived there. Against the captains, investigations were carried out for aid for illegal immigration.
United States Warn Federal Government against Huawei
The head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the Federal Government against trusting the Chinese network driver Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too big," said Pai to the "Trade Sheet" with a view to the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" which requires each company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow instructions from the security bodies.
The applicable law also prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests," continued the FCC chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The Federal Government has now agreed to demand a "confidential declaration" by suppliers.
At first, Berlin wants to try to control the risks, such as with technical solutions, reports the "Handelsblatt" on the call for its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology does not only consist of hardware:
Just the software is important to keep the devices up to date. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change over time," said Pai.
It was "very difficult to imagine" that a government authority, "whoever, could be able to check each individual update in real time to detect security risks," continued the FCC chief.
He presents close contacts with the Chinese State apparatus to the Chinese Group Huawei:
The ownership relationships are opaque. The employee company, which is supposed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," said Pai to the "Handelblatt".
The U.S. has found that government employees were placed within the company. Pai has recently been for conversations in Berlin to advertise for the position of the USA.
Chemical factory in Northern France burnt: Schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions. A giant firewall lights the sky over a North-French chemistry factory. The fire is erased after hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemistry factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday the schools and children's cliffs will remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities, the facilities would not be opened in advance on Friday, the competent prefecture informed. The Ministry of Interior had asked the citizens to stay as far as possible in buildings and not dispose of smoke. Injured did not exist. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals in, protect their food and stop the harvest first.
The fire could be completely deleted on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. It still poses the risk of spreading smell after the deletion, according to the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firemen and 90 police officers and gendarmen were in use at the fireplace.
From the chemical factory, a huge black smoke column had risen. French media reported huge flames and explosions in the factory of the company Lubrizole, the additive for oils repairing. The production plant is located a few kilometers from the city centre.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous locations, which are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso in Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandie region, Pierre-André Durand, said to the news sender BFMTV that it was not found "high toxicity" in samples at first. However, a pollution of nearby Seine could not be excluded. In the river, dams were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire was broke out early morning at 02.40 o'clock, the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and lies on the Seine between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Finance Minister: "Germany has to invest and now"
France's Minister for Economic and Finance Bruno Le Maire called on Germany to increase investments in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany has to invest now, the earlier the better," said Le Maire on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the next year.
The economy in the euro area is weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation becomes worse to make the necessary decisions."
Those countries who have budgetary playrooms for more investment would have to act, among other things, said Le Maire, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these playrooms, added the minister and pointed to the high state debt of his country, which is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French government debt must be "stabilized" and "senked", said Le Maire.
In recent years, France has repeatedly called on Germany to make more public investment in order to experience the European economy. In return, German politicians have repeatedly asked France to control its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides for tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government responds, among other things, to the protests of the yellow-western movement. The re-debt should be reduced to 2.2 percent, according to anticipated 3.1 percent of this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson deviates question about Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson strongly criticizes the "Capitalisation Law" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law prescribes to the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos-brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could use another slump hole. However, the Tory politician deviates on this possibility.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson deals with whether he wants to carry out an unregulated Brexit, despite the last law adopted by Parliament, which is to prevent exactly this. On one question, Johnson just said before journalists that his government would comply with applicable law.
The law stipulates that the government must request a delay in the date of withdrawal should not have been reached agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "Capitalisation Act" which makes negotiations with the EU difficult.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had said on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political trembling" to avoid the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that shifted the entry into force of the law to the time after the EU exit. Johnson said he strive for a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is the one with an agreement."
Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings said in the meantime that he felt the political conflicts about the Brexit as a "spaziergang in the park" and showed confidence that the EU's endeavored withdrawal is still to be achieved: "We enjoy that, we will win, we will leave (Anniversary: EU), no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the "Vote Leave" campaign in front of the 2016 EU referendum, is now acting as the head of the British government seat Downing Street. He is supposed to be behind the uncompromising policy that led the Prime Minister to a clear situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the very great rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) deeply immerses into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who married her from 1969 to Linda's death in 1998, was apparently proud and touched when he presented the band "The Polaroid Diaries" at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in mid-September. The illustrated guests included Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Frontfrau Chrissie Hynde.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting view of the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration of LindaMcCartney's legacy as an engaged artist and the immediate mass of the polaroid film."
At Linda McCartney, who studied art history at the University of Aizona until she found photography, the camera was always involved. Thousands of Polaroids have made it, some hundreds of them are now released in "The Polaroid Diaries".
They are portraits, silence, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "You wanted real moments," writes the art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course, one is always in the centre: your husband Paul - as you have never seen him before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, phoned in the bathrobe with a bag on his head or wearing unshaped moon boats. Surely, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but beyond the headlight on their farm in Southern England or Scotland also led a very normal life. So said Mary McCartney according to BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that her father had brushed out of old potatoes. And it hasn't always been clear of the McCartneys.
How hardly another medium the Poloraid camera starts the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than pure snapshots.
It's about the decision click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you, and then you have to cut it in exactly the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you have been knocking two seconds later or two before, it can be a completely different picture." And Linda would have had the gift to catch the exact right moment. "She just knew that she had it," said Paul in the Eshun-Essay.
The light, the composition, the image section and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertaining picture book for Beatles fans, but also a great aesthetic pleasure in all anecdotics, where landscapes have already worked like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the just new beatles album "Abbey Road", which has appeared exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Despite the US sanctions imposed against Iran, Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from the neighbouring country. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel the import of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," said Erdogan in New York, where he had participated in the UN Assembly.
Erdogan admitted, however, that Turkey has problems with importing Iranian oils, as some companies would have "revoked because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran especially in this question and in many other issues," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since its exit from the international Atomic Agreement with Iran, the USA has pursued a policy of "maximal pressure" towards the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran has pursued a nuclear programme in secret and does not comply with the Agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the breakdown of Iranian oil exports and a serious economic crisis in Iran. Over the past few months, tensions in the Gulf region have increased significantly.
US Government wants to restrict the inclusion of refugees
The U.S. government intends to reduce the inclusion of refugees dramatically. On Thursday, the U.S. Foreign Ministry stated that the annual ceiling of a relocation programme should be reduced from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees, which corresponds to 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that although the US would continue to be obliged to support refugees, it was the most important task to protect and serve US citizens. Currently, the US immigration system was overloaded.
The US Government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqians who have helped the U.S. military in the country and are thus in danger, as the Declaration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs shows. However, a maximum of 1500 refugees are to be incorporated from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN camps are selected and relocated in the USA. The limit of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the history of the programme. The currently existing ceiling of 30,000 is a lowest value. As the predecessor of the US president Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was nearly 85,000.
Aid organisations reacted disgustedly to the announced reduction of the ceiling. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The USA would thus continue to damage their leadership role in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration into the US, legally and illegally. The U.S. government expects 350,000 applications for asylum for the next budget year. These figures are separated from the relocation programme.
Donald Trump - "Come close to a peak"
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused the advisors in the Whistleblower affair of the Spionage. Anyone who has sent to the informant who suggests power abuse to him, "comes close to a peak," said Trump according to a record of a private event in New York. This reports several US media consistently.
As a result, Trump spoke before employees of the U.S. mission. When he was asked for the person who informed the whistleblower about controversial processes in the White House, he replied: "This is coming close to a peak." Then Trump added: "Do you know what we did in old times when we were smart? Right. The spies and betrays, we used to handle it a bit different than we do now."
Observers pointed out the latter remark to a possible significance of the death penalty. The democrats exerted sharp criticism of Trump's statements and challenged him intimidation of witnesses. It was also an attempt to hinder a congress examination of a possible official refusal procedure against him, wrote the chairs of the Foreign, Secret Services and Supervisory Committees in the House of Representatives.
The Whistleblower suggests that the President have abused his office in order to interfere with another country in the US-Wahl 2020. Concretely, he is controversial to his controversial phoneat with his Ukrainian co-college Wolodymyr Selenskyj in summer: In the discussion Trump suggested him to initiate investigations against his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump challenges any misconduct.
It is still unclear who are both whistleblews themselves and their informers. However, as the New York Times reports, the whistleblower is supposed to be an analyst of CIA's foreign secret service.
Refugee boat cemented: Drinking baby and babies in Aegean
At times, people try to get across the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The often too small boats are often known. Seven migrants have now died, including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants died during the fall of a hose boat. Among the death victims were also a baby and four other children, the Greek coastal guard reported. Four children, three women and five men could therefore be saved from the floods from the crew of a passing ferry.
Among the victims should also be a slumber, the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken out of Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group of Inouses in the northeast of the island of Chios. Inousses lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in much to small boats. Over the past year, as reported by the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people died on this route.
The Who breaks off concert
A U.S. Concert of the Rockband The Who has found a rushing end because of an inappropriateness by lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the event on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed to serve. At the eighth song Daltrey told the audience: "I think I should leave it as long as it is still running."
Lead-Gitarrist Pete Townsend asked for apologies and added that Daltrey could "now not speak". Townsend promised to come to his expense at a reconciliation concert. A appointment is not yet established.
For Friday in Dallas and for Sunday in Denver, The Who said that they should be picked up at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old band colleague Townsend are the only remaining founding members. The British cult band formed 55 years ago.
Suddenly stopped rental: WeWork lets real estate markets tumble
In New York, WeWork has risen as the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork rises from small startup to driving force to the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. The landlords have to fear billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office owner WeWork threatens to disturb the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set off the founder Adam Neumann as the boss, postponed the planned stock exchange course and started selling subsidiary companies and values such as the private jet for the leaders to win financial space for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, the British "financial Times", WeWork, has stopped the conclusion of new rents with immediate effect, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenant of office spaces suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and short-term rents them in partly small units to members. This can be individual freelancers, small startups or whole departments of large companies. WeWork burns money with this business in a breathtaking speed. Last year, the company entered a loss of $1.6 billion, with a turnover of $1.8 billion. This year alone, the renting costs due to the renting of new large areas should have increased to an estimated $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new management should now pull the emergency brakes and stop renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the "Financial Times", WeWork has now concluded rental contracts with periods of up to 15 years, which result in commitments of more than $40 billion. These huge liabilities could not only be a problem for the company itself and its investors, but for all real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhatten, one of the world's most expensive real estate markets, in the past 24 months nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. WeWork's new contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly marketed areas in this time. Without WeWork's expansion, the office emptyness in the US metropolis would rise in this time, as Alpert wrote in the "Business Insider". Similarly, in London, where WeWork is now operating several dozen office locations in best position.
Even in the British capital, the balance on the real estate market could be noticeable without any further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the main renter, in a last year's deca for nearly 100 million euros purchased office house in the center of the financial metropolis.
Many landlords have rebuilt their properties for the requirements of WeWork with high investments. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to resign some of the hoped billion revenues. Access to the - nevertheless scarce - reserves of WeWork do not have in spite of the long-term rental contracts. Because the renting of the individual locations of WeWork is usually done by the specially founded subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is liable only in narrow limits.
Russia again arrested numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has resumed against North Korean fishermen. Over the past few days, a total of 262 wildlifers who had been illegally fished in the waters had been arrested, the Russian FSB FSB informed the Agency on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. Previously, the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injuries, it said. The Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortage.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore travelling in Russian high-risk waters. The coast guard of Russia drives, according to its own information, to protect their marine biological resources patrols. 30,000 ink fishes were discovered during the renewed checks. In addition, the information was confiscated by three fishermen and two motorboats and brought to Naodka and Posjet at Wladivostok. According to the Ria Nowosti Agency, a total of over 8,000 infringements were found in 2018.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licences to the North Koreans, even after claims by local entrepreneurs today. Thousands of fishermen from North Korea have been arrested there in 2019.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries companies in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynov, recently also complained of high ecological damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished with narrow synthetic networks banned in Russia. With them, small living creatures would also get out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply be disposed of in the sea where they needed 200 years to be destroyed. The ships themselves do not comply with the hygiene and technical requirements.
According to Moscow’s three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured during the previous week's arrests. According to a also wounded North Korean, the FSB later died of his injuries. Russian border guards first established a North Korean boat and then a second after the fire had opened.
United States prohibition of entry against ex-president Castro
The U.S. has banned entry against former Cuban president Raúl Castro and his children. The American Foreign Ministry founded this in a communication on Thursday with Castros' participation in "great violations of human rights". As head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean State, he presupposes a system where thousands of Cubans were arbitraryly arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As president of the forces, the brother of the dead revolutionary director Fidel Castro is also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. "The misrepresentation of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime in order to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the persistent crisis on Cuba and Venezuela," said American Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump had made a ban on entry against members of the Venetian government and the military. For months in Venezuela, a bitter struggle of power between the government and the opposition has been held. The USA have imposed a whole range of sanctions against Maduro's government to force him into the knee and to help the opposition leader and self-president Juan Guaido power.
Cuba is considered to be one of the closest allies of Maduros. The Socialist Caribbean Island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services sent by doctors. According to the U.S. and the Venezolan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to help the government with the oppression of government opponents.
New Fridays Climate Protests for Future
One week after the greatest international climate protests today, but thousands of people want to go to the street for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement plans to take action and announcements in dozens of countries around the world. The start should be made because of the time shifting New Zealand and Australia before the protests about Europe to North America. There, climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to participate in a major anniversary in the Canadian Montreal. Even before the White House in Washington, demonstrators wanted to gather.
How great the global commitment to this Friday after the recording of the previous week will be, it is relatively unclear. Thunberg itself was good things. "Last Friday have stretched over four million people for the climate. This Friday we do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far there have been 6383 actions in 170 countries in the context of the strike week.
A good third of all the world's demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had been involved in the protests in 575 German cities, according to the estimates of Fridays for Future. This time, a list of events in at least 65 cities are planned, including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland in Sylt.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set up the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to demand the politicians of her country for a stronger use for climate protection. This has created the Fridays-for-Future movement within a short time. Climate protests are mainly involved in students and students, but increasingly also scientists and other adults.
Together, they demand more ambition from politics in the fight against heating and the threatening climate catastrophe. In particular, according to the Paris climate agreement, global warming should be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial time.
Thunberg had arrived nearly a month ago after a two-week transatlantic door with a high-sea racing yacht in New York, where she had last participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she held an emotional speech with the UN, in which she utterly spoke to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home, Stockholm, she was given herself for her use for more climate protection of the alternative Nobel Prize of the Right Livelihood Foundation on Wednesday.
Russia forbids smoking on the balcony
People in Russia are no longer allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This means a change in fire protection. "This is also true of smoking," said a speaker from the Ministry of Emergency in Moscow on Thursday at the Agency Tass. The ban will enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who still smokes must therefore expect a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 euros). If the cigarette should fire, then the penalty falls higher. According to the Ministry, the ban also includes burning candles. It is no longer allowed to grill meat on the balcony.
Stamp against cybercriminal - investigators lift up servers
In the fight against crime on the Internet, German investigators have for the first time launched a large server provider for illegal businesses in the Darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected to have hosted numerous websites on the Mosel as a operator of a data center in a former Nato bunker in Traben-Trarbach, over which the internationally active criminals operate their powers.
Seven suspects were arrested at a large action on Thursday evening. Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects are supposed to have been among other things the operators of the world's second largest Darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", who had destroyed investigators in spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in the cyberbunker, according to the prosecutor of the State.
Such a hoster had been eliminated in Germany for the first time. A web hoster provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
With the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and in the neighbouring abroad. It was the result of almost five years of investigations. In the afternoon, the investigators would like to inform about more details.
New World Climate protests from Fridays for Future
One week after the largest international climate protests today, but thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
At the end of an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement planned action and announcements in dozens of countries worldwide.
In Germany protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including in metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller communities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large publicity in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests ▶ Who are actually Thunberg's hind men?
Righteousness and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that warm the climate. The more amazing that a 16-year-old girl keeps the powermen of this time the mirror ahead of the nose. But what is behind it? Is it helpful or wise marketing a climate activist? Historical master performance or manipulative tactics for himself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people to rise for a better climate-friendly world. It is not historically the first time in Europe that a young man manages to win a gathering of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212 a child named Nikolaus from Cologne felt elected to use a more righteous world. At that time he has also been able to win a crowd of young people for himself, and it convinces to cross the sea to get to the proclaimed country, like Greta Thunberg recently made himself on the trip to America with a sailboat.
But there is a shadow side in this respect? Why does it need a share called "We don't have time" to save the world? Furthermore, Greta Thunberg has rich PR managers on her side. On the other hand, her mother has published a book that has sold itself far-reachingly, thanks to the daughter in the Rampenlicht. Also old-powered followers from Greta Thunberg were a little disturbed over the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also set up some successors too thick. This is not unfounded, because the action came very well in the media worldwide and it flows a lot of money thanks to the imposing action.
Here, the spirits are now divorced: Is it morally right to enrich financially in rescuing the world? Is it still authentic when certain circles of people work together with stock exchange agents during the World Rescue Action? No matter what position it is ultimately involved, a critical and reflected point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can certainly make sense to critically question apparently vicious projects of certain trendsetters.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crosses through our solar system
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The astronomers have confirmed: A foreign comet crosses our solar system at the moment - it is only the second of his kind.
Garching/Washington - Long, the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet of another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is busy astronomers worldwide.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow in the Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and other post-observations confirmed his first suspicion. It is actually an unknown comet that does not originate from our solar system. It is only the second of his kind that was seen during the flight.
The great chance for astronomers is now to haze insights into a foreign solar system from nearby. Apparently, the comet is similar to those of our own system, as reported by the astrophysical Institute of the Canary. The comet is clearly interstellar according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbel track that leads it out of our system.
Comet has already been seen before flight - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, the astronomers can observe it thoroughly. In contrast to its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, which means that it can be examined from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia by the US Space Authority Nasa. "Then it will only be seen by October 2020 with larger, professional telescopes."
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about comet 2I/Borisov awaken hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers of diameter. At the same time, the celestial body seems to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León puts it out, the spectrum of the floating star is similar to us. This observation suggests that comets in other solar systems could form themselves through similar processes as in our León's colleague Javier Licandro.
Observation goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have been discovered within just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
The scientists are constantly employing asteroids. Only recently a giant asteroid passed the earth and came dangerously close to her.
"Absolutely disgusting": Rachel Johnson is disgusted about brother
For Boris Johnson it becomes more lonely. First, his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister crushes the warrior language of the Prime Minister as "smellless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Kapitulation", "Betrug", Treaty": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is constantly on-- at least verbally. At the questionnaire at the suburb on this Wednesday, this was a massive resentment of the opposition, and in the meantime, more critics have reported themselves: Dozens of Bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and writer said to the Sender Sky News that her brother used words such as capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, stretched, quarried, and fed". She considers it extremely disgusting. You do not recognize the version of her brother, said Rachel Johnsons, who had taken place in the elections to the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
She was particularly concerned with the fact that her brother Jo Cox mentioned, an EU-friendly sub-house member who had been murdered by a Neonazi just a few days before the 2016 exit referendum. Their thoughts could be best honored by passing through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the suburb. "It is very tasteless to refer to a member who was murdered by someone who called 'Britain first'," now criticized Johnson's sister. The offender obviously came from the legal extreme camp that feels "through this kind of language". For all who mourned them, it is very tasteless.
The widow of Cox also criticized the Prime Minister sharply. "It makes me sick when Jo's name is used in this way," he twittered. The best way to honor them is to enter passionately and determined for what one believes - no matter what you think. But never should you "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had developed more likely in attacks.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson had laid down his office as State Secretary and his mandate as Tory member. "I have been crushed between loyalty to the family and national interest in recent months - it is an unresolvable tension," Jo Johnson founded the step.
Johnson's language also found sharp criticism in the church. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize the language that "this country is not worthy of worthy". In a common statement, they explained: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez take place at Super Bowl
The NFL sets a strong sign in the year of its 100-year existence: In the mid-term show of the coming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots appear. They promise "a explosion of fun and energy".
Latina-Power at Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will be released at the next final of the US football Liga NFL. This was announced by the organisers on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humble to represent the Latino community next to JLo, because this has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira told in a video.
The final of the American football liga, which celebrates its 100th birthday in the next year, takes place in Miami on 2 February. In the south tip of Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is parcelorician origin.
"I love the super bowl to stage two women this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "a explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents were emigrant from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and can be seen in the Drama "Hustlers" in the German cinemas from November onwards.
Shakira became known as the star of a Telenovela and singer in Colombia. She created her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first two-speaking album and the single "Whenever, Whereever".
The announcement of half-term passengers is expected in the USA each time with tension. This year, many are also becoming the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least by the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and at the same time a gigantic spectacle of advertising. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones provided Furore. Usually, more than 100 million TV viewers watch the NFL-finals, it is also highly popular in Germany.
Last year, political controversy came about political controversy. The dispute about the Quarterback Colin Kaepenick, who had refused to rise from protest against police force against Blacks when playing the National Hemisphere and had been started hard by US President Donald Trump, among other things. From solidarity with Kaepenick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. That the Rock Group Maroon 5 appeared, was finally criticized by many.
An actor and Youtuber adds Egypt's ruler: Mohamed Ali is rather staying abroad.
The two men who have influenced whether blood flows on the streets of Egypt have spent both abroad last week. One of the two swimed back to the airport of Cairo on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the United Nations General Assembly. The former general, who put off in 2013 the Muslim brother Mohammed Mursi, the first freely elected head of the country, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had praised Sisis' action against political Islam and lost no syllables about human rights violations at the Nile - a week in which Egypt's security forces arrested hundreds of people because they had dared to protest against the presidents. He had "no reason to worry", said Sisi at the airport in the microphone of the state television. "The Egyptians did not let themselves go into the error."
In the wrong way, the President of the other man, who is currently determining what happens on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, remained abroad, where he abstained from the access of the security forces that would immediately arrest him if he tried to enter Egyptian ground. Weekly, the 45-year-old actor was only known as a minority of the Egyptians. Today, he is the tonnageing voice that prevails the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and theestubs of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's secrets" Ali calls his countrymen to raise up against Sisi.
He goes on to the head of state directly and in quite rustic language. While the people hunger, the president swells in luxury and let himself build beautiful new palaces, it says. The army leadership on which Sisi bases its rulership suggests ali corruption and enrichment. Because he made in his second profession as a builder for 15 years with exactly these men businesses, he seems to know quite precisely what he speaks - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the just explosive click numbers show.
After being arrested for the first time since Sisis Griff had demonstrated thousands against his rule and almost 2,000 citizens, among them prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were called Ali for this Friday for a "million march". However, there was an unlikely number of people in the streets. But there were several smaller protests, for example in Giseh at Cairo and in the place Kina at Luxor. Videos in social media showed protests, whose participants claimed Al-Sisi corruption and demanded its departure. At these protests, the police also introduced tear gas and rubber floors. These videos did not initially be verified independently. From security circles, the police said that the protests ended.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators last week Banner with the portrait of the President in pieces, was reported on Friday massive police presence. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the exit streets. In Cairo several metro stations were closed in the city because of "maintenance work", most streets around the Tarir Square, the heart of the Revolution of 2011, were blocked. And on the Rabaa Square, where in 2013 followers of the crashed Muslim brother Mursi burst, until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure should prevent being gathered by dissatisfied: Sisis's future party in fact wanted to hold a large gift for the President.
Mohamed Ali caused these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal doesn't have to be the Tahrir Square," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Don't let us be confronted with police officers, but as a retreater, it should not be understood: "All Egypt is the Tahrirplatz".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection appears to be much slower than the provider, there are different testing options.
Anyone who concludes an internet contract does not need to be blindly trusting the speed details of the providers. Customers can check, in case of notices themselves, how much of this is actually achieved.
Finally, the forward-promised transfer rates are a component of the contract and should therefore also be achieved, explains the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection always appears to be much slower than requested by the provider, there are different testing options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"The tests of the providers, however, are carried out according to specific requirements and are therefore not calculated uniformly and objectively", says the Bavarian consumer centre on its side.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can set the provider a reasonable period of 14 days in order to produce the promised performance. This is best done by letter.
This does not affect anything even after multiple requests, customers can cancel and may also demand compensation. However, in the event of persistent success, only help the appeal path.
First ranking Republicans for investigation
As the first ranking Republican, the governor of Vermont has spoken for an impeachment investigation against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where that is from here, it is determined by the facts that are identified," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affairs before action - an impeachment procedure can lead to the postponement of the President.
Scott said that he was not surprised by enthusiasms that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone call to examine interventions by the democratic president and former vice-president Joe Biden in Ukraine. Trump observed bids "in years".
Republicaners have so far refrained from criticism of Trump because of the whistleblower affairs; few have shown discomfort. Scott's comments are a first sign of this in Trump's Party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy several times, for example, against the loosening of environmental legislation and the strengthening of immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in MCU: Next Marvel movie planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: at the end of August it became known that Sony and Marvel will go separately in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the "Avenger" universe. It was quite unclear how it was to continue with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man, after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home", a further final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), which reports several US media consistently. Accordingly, the cinema starts as well: The film will start in the USA from July 16, 2021 onwards.
In the magazine "Screenrant", Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige is quoted: "I am pleased that Spidey's way will be continued in the MCU. I and everyone at the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can continue working on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in various universes, as Sony continues to work on his Spidey Verse. You never know what the future will bring."
But what's the sudden good news? Sony Marvel is supposed to have presented an offer. According to industry magazines, the company Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate with 30 percent in the revenues of Spider Man movies. However, the message is not confirmed.
So Duke Meghan and Prince Harry show up in the "Suits" final
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" has now arrived in the United States at the big finale. In the last episode there were many Happy Ends and as many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who worked in the series for many years, has been in a charming way tributed. Attention, the following sections include spoilers to the series finale.
One precedence: Duke Meghan did not return for a final abschieds greeting as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some retrospectives once again showed the most memorable scenes with today's Duke. For example, the moments of the failed and happy wedding with Mike or how she welcomed him after his detention sentence.
But her true husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits"-final, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) goes straight towards Altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a fascinating comment on his suit. Whether he actually threw himself a cord, the suspected Harvey of the Bräutigam wants to know only to notice, "Louis, you are not the Prince of England".
Aegean: Baby and four other children drown at boat accident
A baby and four other children are drowned when a refugee boat in the Aegean. Overall, seven people died in the calamity, as the Greek coastal guard reported on Friday. Nationalities were still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inousses, located between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Hundreds of migrants from Turkey are currently transferring to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean. Over the past year, as reported by the United Nations Refugee Fund (UNHCR) 174 people were killed. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced to want to visit both countries.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wanted to inform Turkey about "the situation of refugees," said Seehofer on Friday. He then wanted to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens to help with the management.
On Friday, a spokesman of the EU Commission confirmed the planned trip of Seehofers with the EU Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and France's Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece there are still unusually many migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone 654 people were transferred to the Greek islands, said by the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection on Wednesday.
Does the Turkey deal still function?
The increased figures had last doubts about the functioning of the 2016 EU-Turkey Agreement. This provides that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who are illegally coming across Turkey to the Greek islands. In return, the EU wanted to take up a Syrian refugee from Turkey for each deported Syrian.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult on the Greek side because of lack of staff. Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, have nearly 29 400 people. The worst is the situation on Lesbos: 5200 migrates are currently housed in a camp with capacity for 650 people.
Never since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016 had been so many, the state broadcast reported.

Especially people with cardiovascular diseases, older people and diabetics were affected.
Green Politician must be responsible for embarrassing photo pan
The head of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election struggle - was manipulated for this reason of the cup?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in hand on a photo. But now came out: The cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has remained quite long unnoticed - and finally noticed. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw halm has never kept in hand Elizabeth May, the chief of the Canadian Greens. On the party's website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo had already been published and was also distributed to the media - and there was the cup still a snouter (pop) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green Chefin has to be responsible for photo pan
The National Post then challenged May manipulation and that the Fake News Party produces to appear more credible on the subject of "Environmental Protection". And that in the middle of a election campaign to the Unterhaus-Wahl, where Trudeau is increasingly difficult because of a bribe scandal.
The photo went into the social media viral and argued the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counterover of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their chairmen to hide their moulding cups."
May showed herself shocked and regretted on her blog, not to have known anything about this action. To underline this, she posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, a cup in her hand. However, the one who put her right, was from Bamboo. She always had him. A spokesman of the party said that it was only about to put the party logo in the picture, and not to hide something. From the photo is only a section on the website.
May writes, it is her pity for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said to the Guardian and at the same time asked something from her overgrowded team: "If they want to work a picture again, could they not do something with my face, so I look younger?"
The German Greens have also arrived because of their use of unfortunate plastics or for flight trips in Shitstorms, but their pictures were not photoshopped. Thus, the chief of Bavarian Greens, Katharina Schulze, at the holiday ice with plastic spoons, as Merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free-upgrade: lifetime flight prohibition at Cathay
It is said that Jaqueline Ng was guaranteed an upgrade by Cathay Pacific by mail. But when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed to fly on board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the Business Class - of which many passengers dream. Sometimes they have happiness, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the Economy Class for free.
However, this case shows how to not do it: A self-proclaimed influenzarin has actively asked the Airline Cathay Pacific for a free upgrade. On Instagram, Jaqueline Ng is following more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she returned from Taiwan to New York and on June 7.
On the way, Jaqueline refused an upgrade, although she had shown a mail in which her Cathay Pacific was supposed to have an upgrade. The letter wants to have received the influenzarin from an airline marketing worker. On the other hand, the Airline accuses Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time, the woman was supposed to show the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK airport were skeptical: they hacked up at the central. And in fact, the employee from whom the mail claimed to have dismissed the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the news did not appear.
The Airline employees at the airport canceled Jaquelines ticket and imposed a lifetime flight ban with Cathay Pacific. For $1,400 (about €1,280) she had to buy a new flight ticket to Taiwan.
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests, because Cathay had repaid the price for her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline does not submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: For Cathay the influencer has committed fraud, it remains locked for future flights. Furthermore, the airline's terms and conditions say that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied - and now set up a lawyer.
According to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen, oil prices indicate
Oil prices fell in the shortest time on Friday afternoon by more than one dollar. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a Barbecue of the American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped by 1.3 percent to 55.77 dollars.
A report from the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen was trigger for the course-run. Saudi Arabia was said to have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone attack on the oil plants in Saudi Arabia had caused five percent of the global oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels in the civil war country of Yemen, which were ally joined by Iran, had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia, like the US Government, is responsible for Iran. A ceasefire would deteriorate the political tension in the region.
If an agreement could actually be reached, one could concentrate on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, Head of the Department of Raw Material Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil prices continue its downward movement over the past days. A week ago, a barrel WTI oil had cost up to almost $59, Brent almost $65.
Lastly, Bloomberg, called on Insider, reported that the repair work on oil plants in Saudi Arabia has progressed faster than expected after the attack in mid-September. Accordingly, the production volume has reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and is moving back towards the original amount.
Recently there were several press releases called on Insider, reporting on the rapid progress of the Saudi Aramco State Oil Group in repair work. However, raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to plan a stock exchange and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, some relaxation occurred in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently issued release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepares the departure, while the ship continued to lie before anchor, Reederijkf Erik Hånell informed the Swedish radio in a SMS on Friday morning.
However, the US announced to move defense missiles and soldiers to Iranian erz enemy to Saudi Arabia. The fear of escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the USA and the UK had temporarily increased oil prices in recent weeks.
Announcements against Trump intensify themselves
In the affair for possible abuse of power by US president Donald Trump, confusions have become loud against the White House. Several leaders had intensely tried to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a disputed telephone between Trump and the Ukrainian president Wolodymyr Selenskyj at the end of July. This explained an anonymous advisor. The speaker of the Representative House, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi, explicited the White House "dreaty". Trump spoke of a "hexenjagd".
North Korea considers third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has posed doubts that in the nuclear dispute, there will soon be a third summit of powermen Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of success of such a meeting would be questionable for lack of progress in the implementation of agreements of the first summit in Singapore, said Spitzendiplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the Agency KCNA.
The US had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, said the consultant of the North Korean Foreign Ministry. He also criticized stronger US sanctions and the common military manoeuvre of the USA and South Korea. But he hopes for a "wise" and " courageous" decision Trumps to bring it back to an approach.
Trump had said on Monday that he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim was supposed to bring to Hanoi since the failure of the second summit of Trump and Kim in February. In June, both of them met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to re-experience the discussions, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers should help cleaning mines
The British Prince Harry in Angola has symbolically burned and destroyed a springgmine with a blue splitter vest. Close to a camp of the British Halo Trusts near the town of Dirico, he created the ignition circle. In a safe distance, the plunger body exploded. With a view to the goal of getting Angola free until 2025, he later asked before running TV cameras: "I call all the countries whose names are on these weapons, but they have not helped to retain themselves for help."
Pounds under pressure - Anticipated interest reduction
British pound under pressure
Given a rapid reduction in interest rates, the pound loses value compared to the euro.
Frankfurt speculations on a short-term interest reduction by the Bank of England (BoE) increase to the pound sterling. The British currency reimbursed up to 0.4 percent to 1.2269 dollars on Friday.
Inducers of sales were statements by the note banker Michael Saunders. This brought an interest reduction into the conversation even if a chaotic Brexit could be turned off, as the insurance would affect the British economic situation for a foreseeable time. This statement was surprising, since Saunders were the defender of a restrictive monetary policy, said Analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed out the burdens for the economy by the Brexit hack without signaling a direct reduction in interest rates. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to lead his country, if necessary, from the EU on 31 October without a divorce agreement.
More: With its provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could pay for him, according to commercial paper editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proved
Material from the Moscow analysis laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Athletics Association (Wada) and today's Head of Integrity.
New details about the Doping Scandal in Russia come to the outbreak of the Light Athletics World Cup - and they destroy the few of the credibility of what Russian sport had recovered at the beginning of the year and also only as an assassin. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the requested samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Antidoping Agency (Wada). Now it turned out: they were faked.
In December 2014, systematic fraud in Russian sports had been unveiled. The Wada had closed the Russian Antidoping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee reads after individual examination at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio under neutral flag, at the winter games in February 2018, 168 Russian sportsmen and athletes were launched. They were allowed to be part of the World Cups in the various sports, even in the summer, with the host in Russia the football World Cup.
Needing positive findings
In the following September, the Wada resumed the Rusada banan, but called for access to the laboratory and the samples mentioned. The data should provide information on the extent of the confusion of doping cases during state doping. They should help to punish athletes afterwards. Three months later they were finally delivered.
The Chairman of the Independent Integrity Commission (AIU) of the Leichtathletik World Association (IAAF) has confirmed, however, that the Doping Data from the Moscow Analysis Laboratory was manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check if the Task Force has received the right data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung" on Friday. "We have detected numerous discrepancys between the data that the Wada was received from a whistleblower and those who received it from the Russians in January." Many positive findings that were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Leichtathletik Association holds as the only organization on the ban of Russia. At the World Cup in Doha 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada manipulations had already put into space and requested Russia to answer the predictions within three weeks. Russia now threatens the re-locking of the Rusada and in the worst case also the exclusion from the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.
