Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendly.
The two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and the destabilising measures in the Middle East.
However, the meeting is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the debated two-country solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been excited for years.
Washington criticizes the persistent settlement building of Israel and provokes Netanyahu’s lack of will in the peace process.
Due to Obama's deal for the Iranian Nuclear Programme, the relationship of the two continued to deteriorate.
In March, Netanyahu, at the invitation of the Republicans, held a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress, which was partly regarded as a offfront against Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting that had rejected with reference to the election in Israel that was in place at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor said he shot his girlfriend.
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon told the police that he shot his friend and that the officials would have to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Within the house, the officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note that was crippled on a white block: "I am so sorry, I wanted to make it back, I loved Amy and she was the only woman who ever loved me." This was according to the authorities in the letter, and he was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school ground, where, according to the police, he shot and killed a popular professor of history, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that university staff heard shooting at 10:18.
He said that Lamb made the devastating emergency call sometime after that.
Until the end of the day there was another death: Lamm took life when the police boiled him.
One day after the shooting at the university, the students and lecturers forced to hide behind closed doors, the authorities still try to get a picture of what motivated lamb.
The details published by the investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and employees who knew him, helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his teaching.
The police in Gautier, where Pictureiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose teachers include 17 members, and many students attended courses of both.
At the same time, there were some inclinations to problematic behavior.
A student, Brandon Beavers, who praised the lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm had told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for permission for health reasons and said that he had any health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university employment policy meant that the promotion for which lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic way to arrange as an Assistant Professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between lam and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that lamb can no longer answer.
After the escape from the campus, the police later found Lamb's track when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before being arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 Caliber Pistole in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson.
His car was still running in the entrance.
It wasn't immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
In 2009, Lamb started his work at the University, who has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
==References====External links==
One of the long-standing friends Lambs called him intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met by common friends.
She and her friends were at high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her a few years.
He was the swarm of women at the time.
All girls melting there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously some time together.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in the Bakstein House, which adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
The police said that the dog was okay.
The former husband of Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, said they had been divorced 15 years ago, but friends had remained and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed at the ground," said O'Steen about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss, when he and Abigail joined a summer market three years ago.
Later, they played some gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Pictureiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a weakly illuminated bar near Gautier, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb ended his guitar and mouth harmonic game before a serene audience.
There was no evidence that anything was wrong.
"Only a happy couple," he said.
We were cleaning up and joking together.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, directed the first semester seminar program and specialized in American indigenous and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at school.
He was married and had three little children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended a candlelight celebration on Tuesday evening, including lecturers, staff, students and members of the community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mahnwake while the university chore "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace" sang.
The lesson will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We try to move our students to return," said LaForge.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press Authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that Lamm in his emergency call called Prentiss was his wife, but there is no indication that the two had ever married.
Toys R Us plans to set down less workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year, but the toys and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to set up 40,000 people in shops and sales centres throughout the country. In the Christmas season 2014, 45,000 workers were stopped.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said that this month it will begin with application talks and the number of employees increases from October to December.
While the holidays are even more months away, the Christmas business approaches, and companies are preparing to set up time workers to provide shops with employees selling, sending and delivering products.
Michael J. Fox shrews about his "Date" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great job for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We sat in the theatre waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for a coming documentary film "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and it comes to mind that I'm a simulated gay and a arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales at a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary on "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" had premiere 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," said Spielberg, "unambiguously the biggest time travel movie ever turned."
"Back in Time" will be shown on VOD, DVD and selected movies in October.
UN Chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says that his response to Russia's strengthened military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" of the almost five-year conflict, and more weapons will only worsen violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN Chief again urges all parties, including the shared UN Security Council, to unite and support integrated negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the Five Permanent Member States of the Council - USA, Russia, China, the UK and France - at the edge of the General Assembly's Ministerial Meeting this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the collapse in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers "makes this situation insoluble."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey values that show that Donald Trump is serious.
Some have tried to brand him as a flop.
Others made him a joke.
And some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump from the upper ranks on surveys down, it has (now) not worked.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Trump in the two-digit field, and some begin to ask themselves seriously what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump will probably win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at this time Rick Perry's leadership was issued to the rising Herman Cain in 2011, from which no one won only one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general choice.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super Pac and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Trump's perseverance and begin to make their dollars flow to crash him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump's popularity values have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidateship in mid-June, a survey from the Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positive.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures are kept in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa found last week that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP cyclists would be happy with Trump as candidates.
In a survey by CNN/ORC last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that they would be either "enthusiastic" or "satisfied" if Trump would be nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "angry" if he was the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they were "enthusiastic" vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
The next thing about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the Republican voters say that they would be "unsatisfied" or "angry" if Jeb Bush, the favorite of the establishment, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombbastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Irish voters who tend to go to the Republicans believe that the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the first electoral state of the nation, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think that he has the personality for a supervisor, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Nevertheless, 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to carry out his office effectively, and almost six out of 10 Independents say that his temperament does not pass into the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are accustomed to the idea.
When they set up their scientists, Republican voters Trump consider real.
If they are asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, after a survey by CNN/ORC last week, four out of ten say that Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time that four out of ten ends of July put their money on Jeb Bush.
Complete disclosure: GOP counters in the past did not have the most clear crystal balls.
At that time in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought that Rick Perry would win the nomination compared to just 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, a variety of GOP cyclists view Trump's campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered for another candidate, Trump still strikes almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump's leadership, while the anti-trump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates diffus.
But a survey of the Monmouth University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypothetic head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump harvests the majority of support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, before Marco Rubio 14 points, before Walker 15 points, before Jeb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie 33 points.
It's a head-on-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetic head-on-head race.
A scarce majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinions.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Trump say that they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, much can happen to change this, and no one can really say never to change the opinion.
46 percent said that they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Nevertheless, Trump's strongest competition is at the moment of the other outsider, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say that they have formed their opinions are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since then Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico two months ago, the immigration was the turning and fishing point in the public discourse in 2016.
Some are concerned that the bombbastic expression of Trump will keep decisive Hispano Americans away from the Republican Party and will damage the reorientation efforts.
But after the new ABC/Post survey of Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say that they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the immigration remains in the ramlight, it seems Donald Trump will do.
The frustration over the government climbs to new peaks.
At Donald Trump and Ben Carson, about half of the support of Republican voters is now missing, especially through their external status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday survey by ABC/Post, they rather want a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry in Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa republics are frustrated about the Republicans at the Congress, with 54 percent "unsatisfied" and 21 percent "harmly angry".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here at the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential facility - with view over the North Seawatt.
In the street, a square meter of a reet roof house costs 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt the offer of objects is naturally limited", says the study - therefore, the high price.
A new study shows the most cost of a square meter in which special layers.
Of course, 18,70 euros per square metre for a student boy in Munich are not really little.
Contrary to Germany's top locations, one of the prizes occurs like Peanuts.
The property service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranklist of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters prices in dimming heights.
There are several ten thousand euros of nothing - per square meter, well noticed.
But well, who can afford...
By the way, Munich is not at the top of this.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-fold Torschütze in Piräus: Bayern-Star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller opened the FC Bayern the way to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piräus - then it ran.
A sovereign start of the Champions League season.
The world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Götze brought a dream start to the FC Bayern in the Hexenkessel of Piräus.
The team of Trainer Pep Guardiola won her play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympiakos in hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götze's hits (89.) earned at 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth step in series is to be the first step towards finale in Italy on May 28, 2016, where Guardiola finally wants to get the Henkelpott to Munich in the third run.
At his 28th hit in the Champions League, Müller received the Bavarian leadership with the help of Olympiakos Torwart Roberto, who let one pass as a flanked shot of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern-Kapitän Philipp Lahm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium before 31.688 hot-blown fans - and the Munich spoke.
They showed a concentrated and engaged idea without shining.
Piräus had won his youngest six home games in the king's class, including renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011 Borussia Dortmund also stolpered here (1:3).
But the Bavaria, unconquered in seven European Cup duals with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went courageously, but often in their offensive efforts to work too uninterrupted.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting to the left outside Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against the former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more happiness from the right than his flank from the right half-field in the left upper torch.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2:0.
The best opportunities in half one had Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos storms Ideye Brown struck the headball of Poland from the line (26.).
Then by direct deduction, the Torwart Roberto pared with the knee (35.).
Although the Bavaria occupied her dominating game, Piräus could put needle stitches.
But on Torhüter Manuel New was dependent.
For example, when he led a shot of Ideye over the Latte (56.).
Before newly, Guardiola had a four-string with David Alaba in the center next to Jerome Boateng, which made it good.
Mario Götze, after muscle problems back in the box, first sat outside.
The World Cup heavily gave green light only after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer at "Sky": "Whoever wants to do something else, that's awful."
When he first changed, Guardiola decided to fight him when he brought Kingsley Coman to Lewandowski (59.).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76.) and made it clear 13 minutes later, by elephant, Müller put one more on it.
Before the game it came to Krawallen at the stadium.
After a smaller group of partially mummed Bavarian fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the hosts of Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and went on with stacks against the Munich followers.
At least one Bavarian fan was injured from the stadium.
smoking has a higher risk of losing teeth
smoking does not only harm the lung, but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long-term study.
The good news: In case of refusal, the risk drops rapidly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is reflected in the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
The risk of losing their teeth prematurely was increased by 2.5 to 3.6 in comparison to non-smoking smokers.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of dental failure are caries and inflammation of dental meat, the DIfE stresses.
For this parodontitis smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and dental loss is therefore due to more frequent dental inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of cardiacs.
People who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time, the researchers write in the "Journal of Dental Research".
However, it could take more than ten years to reduce the risk to the level of non-smoking, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham.
People need to be convinced of being non-smoking, study director Heiner Boeing of DIfE said: "Smoking shortens life."
Not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and leads to good dental health to high age after our findings.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population from 65 to 74 years of age are affected by dental loss, the DIfE reported.
Earlier studies had already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early dental failure.
The new long-term study undermines the findings.
Archaeologists strike Kölner Rheinufer on residues from the late
For the repeated time, archaeological findings have been made on the right Rhine bank in Cologne.
In the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists of the Roman-German Museum have excavated skeletons and rests of historical buildings, said Museumsleiter Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called ground monuments.
With all construction projects in the district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialist office for archaeological ground memories.
In the third section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it had already been known that in the place of a fortress in the 4th century and in the 8th century a church, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was also discovered, which was probably part of the church.
Young woman covered by freight
After a young woman at the station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern has been unhappy, the federal police asks the population to help.
On the early Wednesday morning at 1.40 p.m., the woman crossed the track from the station building, coming at the end of the railway platform, and was recorded by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
According to the Federal Police, it has suffered the most serious injuries of the train.
She was treated on site and brought to a hospital by rescue personnel.
There are no findings on the basis of the nightly track crossing of the young woman.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are in question.
Indications on the cause of the accident can be provided under a clock-free and free hotline of the Federal Police by telephone 0800/6888000 or any other police service.
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute on TTIP
The EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system for the deterioration of the dispute on the proposed TTIP Transatlantic Free Trade Agreement.
Controversial private litigation institutions for disputes between Groups and States are therefore to be dissolved by a more transparent system, which is much more traditional courts in its way.
"We want to set up a system that the citizens trust," said the EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström on the idea.
The Swedish proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA is proposed.
The German government announced support.
The TTIP aims to create the world's largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The reform plans for the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU and the USA to select independent judges together for a new investment court.
They should come from the EU, the USA and third countries to the same extent.
It is also a second instance for the first time.
It would allow it to oppose judgments.
Until now, the parties to the proceedings agreed on arbitrators, there was no opposition to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months, it has become clear that citizens did not trusted the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
In the long term, it wants to work on an International Investment Court according to its own information.
There, for example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be clarified.
The investor State Scheiding Procedures (ISDS) required in particular by large companies are considered to be one of the main reasons for major resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice, which concerns companies to pay damage to taxpayers, to raise national laws or to enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In first opinions, anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact referred to the EU Commission's proposals as inadequate.
It was criticised above all that they should not apply to the free trade agreement already negotiated with Canada (Ceta).
On the other hand, the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as major progress.
The Commission considers essential points in the reform that Federal Economic Minister Sigmar Gabriel had developed with other EU trade ministers in spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is from the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström's plans.
The European corporate association BusinessEurope warned against limiting the business opportunities by too many new rules.
In particular, small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by this, it said.
When the discussions on the TTIP Free Trade and Investment Partnership agreement can be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been in progress since mid 2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US.
Originally, a framework for the agreement should be set at the end of this year.
This date shall be deemed to be no longer durable.
Delicater Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago Sufjan Stevens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him stands a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with filthy pencil.
The whole audience, about 40 people, is almost taken by Steven's lecture.
He tells on the basis of various places that he always records on the map, which reports his musical and delicate songs.
Where they originated and what it looks there, in his home.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderful creative error.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" it appears smartly composed songs that can be very close to the American folk of the late sixties, but at any time to the great opulent drift.
It creates the rumor, "Michigan" would be the first part of a deferred series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in succession.
However, since 2004 and near Rheine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live suffices him guitar and Banjo.
A year later, the musician living in New York returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a masterpiece appears in 2005.
Overboarded with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album is rising into the American billboard charts and is missing in no annual best list of the influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensive electronic shifts.
This sixth ordinary studio album is still widely orchestraed, but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As long as the smaller clubs escaped, the stage shows will become the colorful spectacle of neon stir bands and large fluorescent stage deco.
Sufjan Stevens currently tours through Germany as part of a five-member band.
In the dark hamburger Mehr!
He presents theatre mainly the "Carrie & Lowell" available since March.
Although now nearly 2000 guests sit in their chairs, the significantly mature Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word addressing the audience, the group of excellence musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience one hears that the talk is "opulent" and that could be done to throw away the "plate in fact".
Stevens is very modestly thankful, plays acoustically few older songs and finally necessitates under a tossing applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
Since his election, Mr Corbyn's debut has been expected with tension at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister
The new Labour Chairman Jeremy Corbyn is to give his debut at the questionnaire of the Prime Minister and to join David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will raise himself to ask the first of his six specific questions shortly after noon, and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour Coordinators from the vicinity.
He demanded "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said that he could skip some meetings to leave them colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr. Corbyn's leadership, because it will come to the member of the shadow cabinet after his appointment and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
In the meantime, the decision of the Labour Chairman to be held silent during a commemorative celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, provoked criticism of a number of Tory-MPs during the singing of the Nationalhymne and is at the centre of several title stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn has drawn attention to himself
A speaker from Mr. Corbyn said he had been "in respectful silence" and he recognized the "Heldentum der Royal Air Force in the Air Battle around England".
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he advised the Labour Chairman to sing the national hymn, "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministries have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn's top team, calling for differences in the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as leaders.
The BBC Robin Brant Political correspondent says that political differences are also "stamping" within labour, according to Mr Corbyn's statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn said to the TUC Conference that Labour would make changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the shadow work and pension minister said that the party was "very clear" that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Chairman David Cameron, since he is a Tory Chief, over the last decade of Parliament's Dispatch Box.
The Labour Chairman, who promised another policy approach, says that he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given him more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP said that the Prime Minister's questionnaire is too confrontative, and that he is not both "treadiness" and disputes with reverses, and instead has made it possible to focus on serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges for young people.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow economic minister, will represent him if he does not participate, for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad.
He also brought the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the floor, and that he addressed John Bercow, the speaker of the subhome house, to discuss the problem.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to remove from the politics in the style of a "casperle theater", which is often associated with the questionnaire of the Prime Minister, but some years later he admitted that he had failed.
Since it was first sent on television in 1990, the questionnaire with the Prime Minister was considered the most important barometer of a leader's judgment and his leadership in the suburb and position of his colleagues, although critics argued that it had become a caricature and needed extensive reforms.
'Geschoten in Joburg: Obdachless young people trained to photographers

But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and thus earn living.
"I something shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and gain a profit from it.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pfund increases as a result of accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
The pound rose rapidly according to data that show an increase in the United Kingdom's wage growth. In parallel, the FTSE 100 was increased by the SABMiller command target.
Between May and July, the result rose by 2.9% without bonuses in the United Kingdom compared to the same previous year period.
This percentage has been the fastest estimates since 2009 over the time of an increase in interest rates.
The pound increased by more than 1 % compared to the dollar to $1.5505 and was up to 0.84 % compared to the euro to 1.3730 €.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition bid of the Rival AB InBev had received.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher after encouraging news from the Competition Group for Luxury Goods Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures strike all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - re-established growth.
Shares of Glencore increased by 5% after the mining industry said that he had taken $2.5 billion by selling shares as part of his strategy of debt reduction.
The shares of the Packaging and Paper Group Mondi were the largest losers on the index, with a decrease of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set his assessment for the company Rating on "sale".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sports clothing company reported a pre-tax result of 46.6 million for the half year.
The head of JD Sports says that higher wages endanger the expansion.
The managing director of JD Sports Peter Cowgill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing force will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company, he says.
The costs could meet JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, and that could mean that there are less additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Lapish 21 years old, a hanfling with superb fries.
The type with the platinum blonde hair is 100 million euros.
Ever more.
Currently Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the generation of U17 is going through.
Like Wiktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
However, since 7 o'clock in the morning, the police sit on the cold stone plates form Berlin luxury hotel at Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live Idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much a day as her Mom Ewa deserves in half a year.
If at all.
He says, "Attentionally, my Wiktoria would have to sit in the tenth class in the gymnasium."
"I fill her a dream."
School duty?
Who the fuck?
The fans aren't.
Don't bear yourself.
He's been taking care of anyway.
For the advertisement in the ad break of the superbowl, he collected three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company washed many, many dollars on the beer account.
And with every doll that looks like him and over the store table, Biber also collects.
If Justin beaver drinks a coffee, you'll be amazed at the window disc.
More than 100 million are said to have been exploited in this way.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally just in the USA and the UK with his new single "What do you mean?" on place 1.
Beers themselves, whose fourth album is to follow in November, do not interest the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does so.
Pegida-Plakat brings Lebanese on Cardoffeldöner-Idee
Potatoes or dyens?
It is both in the Kartophfeldöner developed by the Oldenburger Imbissbesitzer Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the proverb "Kartoffel instead of Döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potato and meat together on a spear.
On the idea, he brought a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the title "Kartoffles instead of Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, in his store a barbecue has been rotated with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculti for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been submitted by the Libanese to the Patent Office in Munich.
It has recently been protected as a model of use, according to the Authority.
So how much meat and how much potatoes the spear contains, Alhay doesn't want to betray.
Just so much: "It tastes even better together," he finds.
Culinary international understanding is also good for its customers.
Metcash starts ground resistance campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash tries to protect the IGA branches from an aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food major dealer Metcash has launched a ground resistance campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi prepares the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events like Adelaide show.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as ice manufacturer Simmo from Dunsborough, who distributes samples in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets for the South Australian football liga to faithful customers.
It is expected that Metcash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29, when the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment is carrying out its annual investor strategy day.
It is a lot at stake, since South Australia and Western Australia make up nearly 30 percent of Metcash's IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notorious provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the East.
However, Analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after the opening of its first markets, Aldi will drop off around five percent of the food market in these two states and will remove all existing players, but mainly retailers.
According to a report published this week, the analyst Tom Kierath of Morgan Stanley estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that next year Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA and will earn sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss of food and food business and the amounts on Metcash's high fixed cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million profits before interest and tax, said Mr Kierath.
At the same time, Metcash loses market shares in the East states, mainly at Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most faithful.
Morgan Stanley assumes that Metcash's sales in food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and the market share will decrease from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent in 2020.
Last week, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, told me that Metcash would probably disappear within a decade. Metcash.
Metcash refused to respond publicly to Mr Douglass's comments.
But it is assumed that a board member of Metcash contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has decreased from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and food trade, which provides about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operating debt reductions at the same time pressure on sales and margins.
However, the wholesaler refuses and invests more than $150 million to improve sales prices with Coles and Woolworths in hundreds of products each week and to improve IGA retailers in improving their shops through fast-growing fresh foods and to provide a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash's main business leader Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and shop restructuring programmes will be applied to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in 2017 in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "kollateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duos, which is often called "Special Ks", was inclined by the infamous controversy of Kyrgios with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the arbitrator, with Harrison exclaimed: "Wawrinka had to beat Kyrgios, and I should beat the child."
While he was last seen to crush a tennis hit after a cramp defeated a potential U.S. open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teen is currently in Glasgow, in competition with Sam Groth, the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup half-finale against the UK.
"One thing I'm quite eager to do is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a little into the dispute," said Healy.
He broke a blower when he lost a cramp in the U.S. open, but he's not the first player who broke a blower of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he's not proud of it.
But, really, he has been extremely good in the U.S. opening, even under the pretty provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves much recognition.
He has a great team around himself, he has a great family around him, and I think he was treated a little too strictly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he's good in shape, he's a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged after his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take into account Kyrgios in the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "common decision" as the right for all, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term solid component."
"First we wish that the team is fully focused on competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios]," said Healy.
And I think Nick has done very quickly the ascent that people like springs and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understandable the consequences of his action. Some time outside of the ramp light, in which he can only think about it, I think it is appropriate, and it's best for the team and it's the best for him.
Europe's Refugee crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes the border, holds refugees back
Hungary declares the emergency and locked the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to get illegally into the country. Everything with the aim of stopping the stream of migrants.
Chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-one country and Serb officials reacted with resentment.
For an unknown time, the people who had fled from violence were trapped in a country line on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and left down there.
But frustrations rose.
When a police helicopter slew over them, the migrants scanned "open the border!" and shouted insults against the Hungarian readiness police.
Some showed back from protest food and water.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" to send migrants back from Hungary, while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbien) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
There must be talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulences at the Hungarian-Serbian border did not agree to a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels one day after the 28-National Block.
However, the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in overwhelming Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that, finally, next month or until the end of the year, an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take 120,000 more refugees, including some of them from Hungary.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not set its hopes on a short-term action of Brussels or of its neighbours.
On Tuesday, the emergency level in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said, in addition, that his country plans to build a stitch wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country - after it ends a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News Correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners were used in the race to create the stake wire scene between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant close passport and the entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Victor Orban has insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 meters high fence (13 feet), which the government built along the southern border of Serbia, a crime. These laws also lay down higher penalties for condemned human dealers.
"On the basis of the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency," said government speaker Zoltan Kovacs Reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to agree on the use of the military which is expected for next week, but reporters of Associated Press have seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, State Security Adviser for Orban, said that in attempting to cross the border, 15 others had already entered the country more deeply.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car with stack wire had arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to edit the data of people and pushed a crowd to penetrate itself there.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection of Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton's advance in front of Bernie Sanders in national survey semi-halved
The former U.S. Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit advance in the democratic race for the nomination at national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the elections (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second, with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is a candidate for the Presidential Office, receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections.
More than five months before the start of the elections, most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands firm what candidates they will support.
But Clinton's supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS news survey, Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups, while Sanders achieved some profits.
Clinton holds a great advance in women and moderate ones, but these predictions have been reduced.
Their support for the men has fallen significantly, and Sanders is only back with 5 points.
Clinton's advantage for democratic voters under 50 years of age has become futile, and they and Sanders are now at the same height.
However, Clinton still has a great advance in the eldest voters.
Last month Clinton was in front of Sanders with two-digit advances in the liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advance with this group.
About half the democratic voters of the elections throughout the country say that if they were nominated by the Party, they would support Clinton with enthusiasm.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps not surprisingly that Clinton's current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusiasticly support them.
While 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidates Donald Trump (35 percent).
If Clinton's supporter is asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to deal with the problems and selectability is also quoted.
Since the Vice-President throws a potential for the President's Office in the scale, 57 percent of the democratic voters of the electoral elections want to see him in the race, although a third believes he should not.
If democratic voters of the elections are asked who would be their second choice for the party, bids are at the top.
More than half of Clinton's followers say that bids would be their second choice far from Sanders.
If bids decide not to compete for the nomination of the democrats, Hillary Clinton's advance before Sanders, from 20 points with bids in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the choice, but this number of 78 percent has decreased in the last month.
Biden is by time a second in this measurement, but the percentage that considers it the "electablest" has risen.
Nevertheless, in the question of what is important in a candidate, democratic voters call questions about selectability.
As in the last month, no one democratic candidate or potential candidate for these electorates is unacceptable.
The democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some important features in the elections of their party.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong management qualities.
Biden is best cut off with honesty in the three candidates, while Clinton's strength is the leadership.
Thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say it about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic electors of the elections generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in accordance with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Since questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal e-mail address and a server continue to be asked during the term of office as Foreign Minister, most democratic electors of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall.
But it's another story in the American public as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about one third is satisfied.
The public opinion on this was split in March shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the e-mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said that their opinion of her had worsened.
It is mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say that their views of Clinton have become worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by the voters of her party, this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total: only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May.
62 percent of voters do not think they are an honest and trusted person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters throughout the country consider Trump not honest and untrusted.
Clinton and Trump, however, receive good notes on leadership.
From the six tested candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush best cut off with honesty.
A majority consider Sanders more than honest, but as with Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the preferences is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson goes up close to Donald Trump on a country-wide survey
Ben Carson is at the latest survey of CBS News/New York Times close behind Donald Trump
The two candidates now have half of the support of the voters in the new survey, and others are losing dramatically from stop.
Republican electors continue to support Trump in large numbers throughout the country. Support grows of 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month, by 27% in the survey on Tuesday.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also revealed that Carson arrives well at demographic groups and Trump exceeds with higher education among Republican voters.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsins Governor Scott Walker, who has most fallen from 10% support last month to now 2%.
The former Florida governor Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio, is in the third place at 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 persons from Republican voters in this latest survey is Plus or Minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week shows that Carson is increasing in the surveys - he lands with 19% support for the Republicans, behind the Trump with 32% support.
The recent survey of ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly before Carson.
With a view to a Carson rising last week, Trump found some side hive for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized to question Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa.
Comfortable bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even though top values are measured only in the distance, bathing holidays already have a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water.
A bath in the North or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some do not go to the sea anymore: Maximal 18 degrees has water in the North and Baltic Sea this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) informs.
On the other hand, bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic, it is in the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes at 28 degrees.
Five members of the Brotherhood stressed the death of a Baruch College Newest
Almost two years after a student died during a shocky ritual of a student connection in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, Mortgage are submitted against five persons.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, informed the police.
Officials said that he had been burdened with connected eyes with a 30 pound backpack full of sand, and was repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a goal over a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained about headaches, then he fell unconsciously.
The members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911, after Deng became faint and supposedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothing, googling his symptoms, and Andy Meng to contact the national president of the brotherhood to get advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"On this point, the members began to hide utensils and set the welfare of the brotherhood basically over that of Michael Deng," said Police Chief Wagner.
He couldn't be revived, and he died the next morning of his injuries.
After an autopsie report, Deng was added repeatedly with stubborn force injuries on the head, rump and thigh.
"Too many families were destroyed by the shocks of the brotherhood. At least one student died every year since 1970," said Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be drawn to account, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury from Monroe recommended a charge for murder's third degree for the first five members.
Two-thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also accused of horrible attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We want to make not only the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that has sanctioned this, officially or unofficially, we will also take them to account," said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has forbidden the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood has revoked its belonging to the local group.
This will happen when the Fed increases interest rates
An increase in interest will come, and the house will fall down, yields for borrowings will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, the history for the economy provides only small guidance for the process.
A recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, though not always, a factor in how the economy and the financial investments react.
Consequently, representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when they start to increase interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalisation.
Indeed, several variables play a role.
At the end, however, market participants may find that the whole excitement may have been exaggerated because of an increase in interest rates.
"The first increase of Fed since the global financial crisis will unquestionably be interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of "billy money", said Julian Jessop, Chief Economy at Capital Economics, in a communication to customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal heights, but still to a low level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no effects.
Here is a historical view of how some sectors of the economy could react:
As the market saw last month, the precipitation of interest increases can make things volatil for a while.
As soon as the increase occurs, the influence is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a tendency that assets are thrown off 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may reflect the delay in monetary policy again," said Deutsche Bank-Analysten in a recent study on what happens after the Fed's interest increases.
In fact, the market is mostly in the upward trend over the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase, quite flat in the 250 days afterwards (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal state after 500 days, with an average yield in the last six previous cycles of 14.4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Doll, Chief Investment Strategy at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron's.
The Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares are tended to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to reduce.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession.
It is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 interest increases since 1950, the nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to Atlanta Fed.
Interest increases in such a fragile economic scene could be risky and raise the question: "Whether this time is different," said Deutsche Bank.
Market participants have taken the whole year to increase the Fed interest rate, and all the eyes were addressed to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the future trade only indicates a probability of 25 percent.
"In our study, all increase cycles took place from 1950 to this day in a super cycle with increasing fluctuation in GDP, and pre-recession heights were shaken very quickly after the beginning of recovery," said the report.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery of what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is far from the longest that the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months.
The fixed income was also volatil, as the market preceded for an increase in interest rates, and the pattern is quite similar to in the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when they change their strategic course.
In the case of bonds, the yields appear to change the direction as soon as the first increase/senkment is made in the cycle.
At the end of the elevation cycle, the loans are immediately falling, the Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's Straighters believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a closer collapse of yields between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a deflation of the curve.
High-income bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate, although "we are still careful to expect higher earnings," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyser at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones says that the markets have already adapted to Fed Strategy expectations.
"In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stricter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit margins have expanded and volatility has increased - all the features of the market when the Fed strengthens its strategy.
Overall, companies who carry out the majority of their business in the USA will benefit from increasing interest rates and becoming more attractive local products.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse because a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts.
"The story shows that "Quality-" shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase," said Goldman Sachs-Analysten in a report for customers.
Companies with a strong balance sheet averaged by 5 percentage points after each of the interest increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low-quality borrowers at an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a major problem.
Companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will most lose, said Goldman.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Sparers could see profits through higher earnings, even if experts are different opinions about how quickly this will take place.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the transmitter for his "dampness"
He argues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only imitated The Brits
Parliament-college Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "changes" to Classic FM, claims a leading Member of Parliament and increases pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private senders do not do.
The Conservative Deputy Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC bosses that the public-law radio broadcaster "dummed" and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "damn" - but it seems to turn to Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards that started last December.
The BBC Music Awards that started last year seem to be The Brits only under a different name.
So, if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneous examples in which you actually imitate only what is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
BBC Director-General rejected the allegations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far from its commercial competitors when it was about live music and public clarification.
What I learn from Radio 3 I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there is an engagement for live music and music that is really inextricated.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, to find new music and to order new works, I also consider it really important," he said.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey argued that it was harder to work to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production, however, which, during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sports, was under fire to refrain from the commercial rivals.
The Tory member Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was purchased by Dutch producers Talpa Media for estimated cost of £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly markant?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced "on special BBC White".
He added that he wished that the company would find "a hit from our own stable" when it started a conversation series next time.
However, he refused to exclude the order of further series of The Voice in the future or spend money from the payer for other entertainment formats.
Internet sales increased slowly in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month, the lowest result has been recorded since the beginning of the records in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday in November has brake the expenditure
For over a decade, virtual shopping has grown, and many of the UK's main shopping streets have turned into spirit cities.
However, experts say that there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
The overall expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year.
Experts say that there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back until 2000, it has always developed over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago, as buyers started to purchase with their mobile phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments, for example at home on the sofa.
But now this is going to happen, and we may experience that growth is diminishing.
The Black Freeday phenomenon, imported from America, is quoted as a reason for the slowing turnover.
Experts believe that buyers will keep their purchases before this event, which will take place on last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers went around their computers to make their beaks, and some distributor websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where the buyers fighted for snails, could prevent buyers from buying.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that 5 £ expenditure was spent a little more than 1 £ online.
For some products such as television and washing machine, more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried in Mekka at crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are worn by Muslims at the first funerals in Mekka through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse part of the huge Saudi Bin Load Group to the burden
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed
Hundreds of Muslims gathered together when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed on Mekka's grand mosque.
The mourners filled, largely dressed in white, the route to sol their respect when the first of the dead directed their last trip to the Al-Moaissem Friedhof.
The mourning procession passed over at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a crane of construction was crashing through the ceiling of the mosque and then the beatings.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi-König imposed a sanction on the construction company of the Bin Laden family for the catastrophe, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 bearers killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque Mekkas were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual Haddsch in the Great Mosque.
Saudi officers have already promised that the Haddsch to Mekka will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
Today King Salman said that the Bin-Laden group shouldn't have abandoned the arm of the crane when he was not used.
An Arab version of the Decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin-Laden Group was responsible for the collapse.
The English-speaking service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company was prohibited.
At the beginning of this week, Salman praised to reveal what caused the collapse of the crane that fell into an interior yard of the great mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Haddsch, which later took place this month.
The Bin-Laden Group has not published any statements on the collapse of the Krans, and its representatives were not available for an opinion.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for uncurrent security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mekkas Großmoschee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin-Laden Group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruler family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has taken over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was an abtrinsic son who was defeated by the family in the 1990s.
The crane crash came in the midst of strong winds and rain, just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslim.
Officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital.
Government representatives ordered that 1 million rial (€ 174,000) should be paid to the members of the dead and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injuries receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British employing craftsmen increasingly, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen behind themselves
This leads to the opening of 200 other Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q sales sites throughout the country
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of Daily Mail
It is claimed that British lay down their hammers and brushs for the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes
If you can handle a hammer or brush to strip walls, you seem to belong to a minority today.
Because British are increasingly employing craftsmen to carry out homeworkers in their homes, the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new managing director of Kingfisher, who owns the construction market chain, said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at lowest prices has now been obsolete.
Consequently, Kingfisher plans to open 200 other Screwfix shops that address craftsmen and close 60 B&Q sales sites.
Mrs Laury said she wants to investigate more women in B & Q shops, because eight out of ten purchase decisions are made by women in the store.
At the moment, the men are overwhelming among the employees.
She said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We must move this more towards a balance.
In principle, half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a British FTSE100 index, has also rebuilt her top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs Laury said: "This was an conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher indicated a decrease in the half-year profit and sales after the group trained the costs for closing the shops.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new branches.
Functionaries of Aich/Dob for unfaithfulness in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vicemaster Aich/Dob had to be responsible for infidelity and retirement.
The defendants were not guilty.
One of them had also been accused of abuse.
He was ruled out by this announcement in May.
The current process has been ejected.
According to Supreme Prosecutor Robert Riffel, in the pre-examination investigation, it was crystallized that the defendants used funds from association accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions for private purposes in 2006 to 2011.
The damage amounts to around EUR 400,000.
Sports officials are also charged for financial crimes.
This fact excluded the chairman of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
In order to discourage the unfaithfulness, the defense suggested that the association did not at any time have a loss of assets.
The sports operators would have only charged expenses and the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and invested in a lot of time and money, brought out of the debt – the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shilling in 2001 (approximately 44,000 euros).
"The time we were facing the situation: do we continue to run the club or lock it?" said one of the defendants, in the bread industry large business auditor of the financial office.
With his colleague and co-member, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We have shot up money, put our life insurance as a security at the bank," he said at the receipt.
The association has been agreed: you can manage the money freely, it may only not be made debts.
Furthermore, in the case of financial success, the payment of expenses had been decided retrospectively until 1991.
Therefore, some of the cost damages were paid only years later, that is, from 2003 when a plus had been on the account.
Therefore, the former Obmann explained the transactions.
The accounts and savings books managed the two defendants together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payouts had not been published to the association.
The association was not interested in the financial event in detail, that only the freedom of debt was important, the answer.
When in 2011, against one of the official investigations on the grounds of abuse, a amount of EUR 120,000 was transferred to the association account.
These were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association according to its statement.
"Why?" the judge wanted to know.
The respondent had no answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club.
If something had happened to him, nobody would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-applicant had been informed, the functioner justified himself.
This transfer has been formulated as a "rehabilitation of damage".
Why damages?, Judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he had not agreed with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what shall I do when the lawyer says, "With this you are all out of the cutter."
"I am a legal representative?" he asked.
The functioner also said that he had never earned a cent salary, he only had mileage money and diets.
He accounted for 1,000 euros per month on diets, but the actual effort was much higher, he added.
Exact documents for the early years could not be provided by the defendants.
They explained that these had not been retained after an operating test in which everything had been judged as correct.

All the surveys were made in cash, so he had to drive from his place of residence to the Bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main proceedings will continue on 23 September with the question of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard strikes further 30,000 jobs
In addition to the degradation of staff for three years, the computer giant will reduce further jobs when the company is split.
The tracks at the US computer Hewlett-Packard (HP) do not end.
The U.S. Technology Group plans the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its company customer savings as part of its restructuring.
This will save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company informed on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special burden of about 2.7 billion dollars, which will fall from the fourth quarter.
The degradation of 55,000 jobs for three years has not yet been completed.
HP still employed around 302,000 employees at the end of the financial year 2013/14.
Afterwards, the Hewlett Packard share gave up 2.3 percent.
The group grown up with printers from the Californic Palo Alto is currently split up: This is how the computer and printer business is still to be bundled in a new company – separated from the more future-structive areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both shares are to be recorded at the stock exchange.
A newly disappointing PC subset as well as a weaker demand from business customers for their services have recently added to the world's second largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo.
In the third business quarter at the end of July, the sales of PCs and printers decreased by 11.5 percent.
Turnover fell by 8 percent to nearly $25.4 billion.
Thus, the revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a splitting and massive pitching.
The 76-year-old company under the leadership of Meg Whitman has only responded lately to the fact that customers are increasing smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers buying and doing more and more shops right now online.
Whitman's restructuring plans totally provide for the degradation of around 55,000 jobs.
Conflicts: majority supports the anti-IS training mission
However, a direct participation of German soldiers in warfare in Iraq would primarily be opposed: 54 percent voted against, 35 percent agreed.
The fact that other states fly air attacks against IS in Iraq and Syria find 61 percent positive.
24 percent are opposed to intervening in the conflict.
A cooperation with the Syrian powerholder Baschar al-Assad rejects 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be for this.
29 percent could not decide.

After two press days, Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel will open the 66th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto "Mobility Connectes" officially on Thursday.
The wide audience can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900 000 visitors two years ago.
Röszke: violent outbreak at Serbian-Hungary border
The Hungarian police used several hundred refugees at the Serbian border with Röszke tranches and waterwerfs.
Euronews Correspondent Dániel Bozsik has experienced the outbreak of violence at the border control point.
He reported on the phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
After that, a police line had formed and behind the police was a water lighter.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles to the officials.
The officials initially used uninterrupted pepper spray.
After that, the police used tear gas.
Many tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
The group was dissolved.
The refugees have now withdrawn something waiting for.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who had breathed the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees sucked together and suffered from breath.
The press speakers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the US note bank
The world observes when the US note bank meets on two days, on Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest will be increased or not.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found out that a little more than half, which was still thinking last week that the Fed would do this, now thinks that the Fed will endure a little longer and will keep the interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It's a historical event because it's seven years ago since the Fed interest rates set on NULL.
"For the first time, we approach a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalisation of interest rates," said Angel Ubide, head of staff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is at a relatively good performance level, billions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rusty view of global conditions.
It has warned the markets to set up an increase, but the signs indicate that the opportunities against such a step are good.
The decision should be notified at 20.00 MEZ on Thursday
Death Protects at Delta State University left apologies
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before later on the day he shot and killed his colleagues - Shannon Lamb wrote a note to say that it was "suffering" for him at the first murder and wanted to "he could make it unaffected," public authorities announced on Tuesday.
The police in Gautier, Mississippi, said that Lamb, lecturer for geography and social science at Delta State University, called the emergency number at 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning
And he said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the staff of the emergency call centre that the police had to send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that a "sweet dog" in the house, but "nobody will disturb" but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he didn't give him.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note of Lamb, 45, saying: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to make it back.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb traveled 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when policemen surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between lam and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday, which lamb claimed to believe that Pictureiss had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that there was "no information, no evidence" for a "dreieck relationship".
Pictureiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who said that they were married about seven years, as a "good man".
The two were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a daughter who was 19 and she was "devastated on the ground".
He said that Prentiss was her daughter "absolutely best friends."
Pictureiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by Sun Herald as a close friend of Pictureiss.
Knowles said that Pictureiss, who had a dog called Lightning, met with lam for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," said Knowles
The police said that Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them, "he won't go to prison."
Later this night, when police officers picked him up on highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctoral title from Delta State University in spring 2015, as his lifelaunch is indicated on the university website.
Stars who have lost their fortunes
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought against leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-standing partner, Farrah Fawcett, for cancer.
The actor is also supposed to fight with drugs, and in 2008 he was sentenced for drug possession.
All this certainly demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the Group
The Lufthansa plans a large group building.
A half billion euros a year will save the Lufthansa Group alone with a better organization.
150 of the world's 1,000 executives will cost the business.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot association.
Lufthansa rebuilds its company structure and grows up the Billigdaughter Eurowings.
The aim of the reorientation is to make a result contribution of around EUR 500 million per year from cost and redemption synergies, the airline informed on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer be responsible for the passenger business.
The Eurowings Billig Airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the board team for Chief Carsten Spohr.
Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the Group in the future wants to tackle Ryanair and Easyjet.
So far, the organisation of the 120 000 employees was complex.
The airlines operated under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), negotiations will be resumed after the judicial strike stopped this Thursday.
The trade union told that.
The subject of the discussion is to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to be able to achieve as soon as possible "in one year with a predicted record result".
The conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months.
Background is the "Wings" concept in addition to the transitional supply of the pilots.
In the fight against competitors, it provides that Lufthansa migrates routes to the Group Billig Line Eurowings.

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg at the Champions League of Manchester at PSV Eindhoven.
While this brought the left outside defender to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up the hope that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
The injuries were caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw had broken into the PSV area.
He was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He's moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then it happens.
In the dressing cabin he had a oxygen mask.
There was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, then it takes six months, and he won't play during the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the hanging of an elephant meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the arbitrator, has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian arbitrator had been wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elephant meter and a red card were lapsed.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A Tweet on Shaw's account said: "I thank you all for your news. Words can't describe how broken I am, my way to recover now starts, I'm more coming back."
Concerning this: Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat of the PSV
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover until June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV trainer, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player leaves the place with this type of injury, all are very sad about it.
It's never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent.
Moreno suffered a bone break when Mexico played against Van Gaals Holland Mandate at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball that was going in another direction, so it looked like he had touched [Moreno], but I couldn't see the attack on Luke.
In conversation with SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how hard this can be.
I'm very bad at it, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Surely, does David Cameron The Lorax know better?
It is one thing that all parents soon learn: If your child loves a book, it will not take long until you know it almost out.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister for The Lorax, the Environment Fabel published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss, decided.
It was a difficult choice, writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company SuperCamps, and continues: "pleasant, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it is a book that I like to read my children, because it always seems to give an image or a message that we have missed so far."
All right and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron claims to describe the act of the book, represents instead a content indication of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to extend the pretty short original text.
"With the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a goods, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams by fulfilling his desire to see a real tree," reads one. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose right name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and died in 1991, but completely unknown.
As if this wasn't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and begins so: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a product, a boy named Ted hopes to win the girl's dreams, the heart of Audrey."
Although he admits to be a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the act of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is devastated by the money-loving, tree-taking, Thneed-stroking once-ler despite the protests of the named Lorax, a hoking, snorry being "that speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax 20 times afterwards to a child.
One Downing Street spokesman said that the text was probably from Cameron's electoral office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's employees, but did not give any further direct comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by exclusion from England's team, but it's still hard
Attacking Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you see the box that England has chosen for the tour, a repetition of the 3-0 test series is not on my map.
I wouldn't exclude an outward victory.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the three years ago, but there are good spin players in the Batting, and the community spirit is strong; they will not wear scars of 2012, only a teenage-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if it represents an unknown size at test level, is an option for the attack.
According to this message: Adam Lyth separates from the England Test Cader and is replaced by Alex Hales.
Of course, the decision to leave Adam Lyth is hard to analyze for me as his chief trainer in Yorkshire.
During his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that kricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I said this before - players are their own best selectors.
A long time ago, one would have extended the course of Lyth, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he hopes to make more runs for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
The England-Trainer Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not deliver such good achievements, and that doesn't surprise me; he is primarily a team man.
The question of how much time a test fighter gets to put his sign is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and out.
The only accusation that can be raised was that England first put Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales's coming in, and he's a Schlagmann I appreciate.
He is an X factor cricket player, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he reached 236 against us on a Trent Bridge place, which we met very much.
He must have at least the same opportunities as before him, but this depends, of course, on the teamship in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat next to Cook, which would deliver an extra spin bowler and receive four quicks, appeared, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a Schlagmann can't beat there, and this left hand has already shown that he's a devil cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his county Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former team colleague Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the box as a backup spinner, and in my limited dealing with him he impressed me as a young man.
People may look at their statistics - average 31 with the blower and 35 with the ball - and think it's a point, but there's no large number of backup spiders that lift their hands and the trainers have decided for youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made a few smart supplements at the train stand.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game that will bring a lot of experience, as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful use into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international Cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing cabin, even though the news are in harmony with the previously said.
Collys team colleague at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part.
Some will not agree, but Coaches and team creators do not determine the schedule.
And you have to remember that like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made easy of heart.
The Brexit-Lager (Brexit = UK exit from the EU) could win in the run if the economy drew into a fluid by 2017
David Cameron's unextended new negotiation strategy in order to keep Britain in the EU will be in trouble with every day, even without the choice of the genial Jeremy "Is it Yes or No?" Corbyn to the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is severely struggling about Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomatic friend recently said that some Member States, as deeply engaged in different crises as the EU is now and not always full of their own debt, the UK itself created agenda with split concessions and disturbing contractual changes that they usually do not want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like it even if they threatened social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's Selfie agenda.
Prime Minister and Ministers of Finance climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture of themselves before a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they win allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wishes an outside-looking UK within the EU tent - "Don't leave us alone with France," says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials have come in some major cities to the point where they don't care whether we stay or go.
Germany's cautiously sponsored Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as happened in the exaggerated long perseverances such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Hollande looks at his re-election or his replacement in 2017.
He is also a burning force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right government, Spain a left.
It is difficult to imagine that they will rip out a leg to help the selfie letters whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland's exit from the UK - something that they do not want, because most of them have similar separate tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even deliberately plan not helpful remarks, all in the SNP style, while Britain's referendum campaign in 2017 to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a pledge" and "Great Britain won nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how rubble the Fleet Street can be at its expense and which EU skeptics are the oligary of the press barons, as it was during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
They can do well to remember Boris Johnson, the arch-Euro opportunists who made a name as a "EU-generous banana" Brussels Correspondent in the early 90s.
At all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the Medley of tax-fighting choirs, telephone-hacking foreigners and the Pseudo non-inlanders who have most of our large newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought similar about her, but found that when you sit with a hot gorilla in a cage, you better distribute bananas to distract him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself, when he opposed Cameron's referendum wrestling, because Blair had put the principle on the unapproved constitution of the EU, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which opened him a back door.
The press never forgave him that.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly clapp on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me to waste - seems in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's Boykott Murdoch strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and today.
It may take, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe - I'm saying it kindly - is in development.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside Ukip's traditional blue coloring tendency and the wilder filds of Tory's small Englandism can say yes.
It is what Hilary said "A Benn, but no Bennite" Benn in the radio and television this week, when the path finder fought in him, did not admit that Corbyn's appointment of the provoking John McDonnell as a shadow Chancell was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried on television to be disloyal to his working cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But to fight to stay "under all circumstances" - Benn's expression - was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC told his fellow fighters and MEPs at their meeting on Monday evening, according to all reports.
Whatever the stirring bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important around the clock in the age of TV and above all in the bush of the social media, a breeding site of Paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to consider labour support in the referendum campaign as a natural one, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins must think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyns' fundamental ambiguities to EU membership - in line with their bennite deposit economy, their anti-capitalist past - are no longer just a question of esoteric discussion among left-hand dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with its ambiguities to Nato - Tom Watson, rockenfest is convinced that JC does not start a campaign for exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their supervisors at home in all.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital, - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if this can be all meaningless?
The United States is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a reduction in the cost of the Tory government in power, which was reminded of something that was called British Influence Security Forum when I started on Monday.
Experts criticize Report by Public Health England on E-Zigarettes
State-funded agency claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking created from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, said researchers.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "Grundsatzbericht" last month and describes it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, some researchers have questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A guide article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinary windy foundation" on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two further researchers write in BMJ and asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness."
They said that the public expects the claim of PHE that "the present best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 persons called to develop a model for a multi-critical decision analysis (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis - MCDA) in order to create a synthesis of their opinions on the damages of different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose managing director should have previously received from British American Tobacco Mittel (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT's references to public health in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the financing he had supposed to have received beforehand from the tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The reasons for selecting members of the panel are not provided, but include several known e-cigarette champions, some of which also specify a industry financing in the paper.
Some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know-how in tobacco control.
At the meeting, the tobacco management of PHE also took part.
The research work of the group "is notable" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the damage of most products to most criteria", wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said that the claims of PHE that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes have been used as a way of smoking for children or non-smoking."
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ's claims had already been responded before.
He said, "E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking."
Every second life-long smoker dies from his addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what does not, especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die annually from a smoking disease, and smoking costs the national health system two billion £ a year.
Through the clear presentation of current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfil our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
The former president of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, said the BBC should stop sending programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said that commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs, which are probably seen by a smaller audience, in toughly controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their rivals and broadcasters such as BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried to contact the BBC for six years at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioning or sending, which would also clearly be shown by non-subventionated rivals," said Johnson to the Oberhaus Communications Committee in his study on the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the radio fee, which I do not think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least give its production to programs that others do not or do not.
They send The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to achieve as wide as possible support for their future.
The idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's naturally nonsense.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax programme could be financed without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I'm trying to see how this is supposed to be public-law television.
I don't think this would actually reduce the BBC.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series leading Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said that the BBC was guilty of looking for reviews "because of the ambitions of people working there, and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular broadcasts reflect what the former director of Sky, Tony Ball, suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like EastEnders should sell.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs should go to BBC4, where you can't measure the audience, but they're doing their tasks, and they can argue when they go to their hypocritical missions to justify $4 billion, "Well, of course, we've created all these obscure programs that no one has seen."
They put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them.
On the radio fee, Johnson said to the Committee: "I ask you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value from it.
Of course you all think we all think that you get a great value for 150 pounds a year here, but for people who are a lot of money for the 150 pounds, ask me if that is true, because they do not consume much from the BBC.
The former Sky and Channel 5 Chief David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee on Tuesday, demanded that the BBC check its Reithian mission "to inform, form and entertain".
He said that only a few of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1% of their TV production and 0.1% in the radio - and it should take an example to the public-law television broadcasters in Australia and Canada to change this in "informing, clarifying and entertaining".
On the question of partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, of which he said that only one handful is shown on television, and enter with the commercial broadcasters alliances to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' can control brain cells by sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change the direction in the moment they are radiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have cultivated worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change the direction in the moment when they are radiated with sound impulses that have too high frequency for the human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by switching on motoneuron cells which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace the deep-head stimulation, an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson disease.
Faden worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found out, strengthen the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The enhanced ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4-ion channels and are found in the membranes by some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells assigned to them, according to a report of Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms in such a way that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4-ion channels.
When applying ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are increased by the microblasts and transferred to the worms where they activate the modified motoneurons.
The process has some similarities with optogenetics, a trackbreaking tool that enables scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that Sonogenetics could have some advantages about this technology.
Unlike light that must be sent down at an optical fiber to the desired point in the brain, low frequency urtrasonic waves of tissue can pass unhindered and can thus be sent into the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make the targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," said Chalasani.
Other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right in front of your door!
The advertisements embark on the United Kingdom's arms trade
Amnesty International Anti-Waffen watch fair video.
Awful killer drones!
Football crushing leg tie!
Streubombs!
And electric shock sticks that cause painful pain, but don't leave a trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest weapon fair is a fighting parody produced by Amnesty International to bring the British government's willingness to embarrass weapons to repressive regimes on the defence and security equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in London Docklands.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in the subway trains and which require a second look.
"Important announcement: Are you driving with the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the London Underground writings and the DLR marking line that turns to the picture of a tank.
In September a swarm of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the weapons fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Gray Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs", a £6 pack of inbus keys, claiming that "access to approximately a third of the bus stops advertising surfaces on the planet."
Transport for London does not like this poster "Vandalism".
One of the parodie ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
After Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists are working with activists within protest movements and notice that they have to go out into the real world so that their art has an influence on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade plaques greets the pendlers in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the Advertising Agency VCCP, who works with the graphics and voiceover artists, who also works free of charge.
VCCP-Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed by the silence that ruled around the advertising for the weapon fair - through an empty space of the ExCeL calendar - and thought: "Let's give them the campaign that they are trying to avoid."
They played with the invention of a more realistic business advertising, but "through the blooming with bright colors and animation it remains stronger."
"They have made a fantastic job by helping us to intensify the consciousness of the sale of illegal torture devices on the fair," says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is an intervention by the British Government and the guarantee that torture devices are not acted illegally before our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the weapons fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors intensify fantastic euphemist products.

Eight Golden Rules for Life in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a 19-year-old, I moved to a student home, still in faith in Berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the tense smiles of those I have annoyed - and the numerous long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I have learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
The entrance to students' homes range from slightly nervous up to absolutely frightening.
It is tempting to sweat: people tell where you come from, whether and where you have taken Sabbath year, where you are in relation to Corbyn and why you "really said you don't love Marmite or hate, because seriously, boys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'm in my room."
Breathe through.
And help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those you wouldn't talk to, even if your diapers burned and these fire extinguishers would be.
Leave people.
The rooms of people often turn into drink receptions, film night events and local meeting points, but they are also the places where people dress and reverse their underwear.
Concerning this: Do not think about starting the university with a relationship
Introverted people receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a Refugee, but many students' homes form a room-to-room bummel culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
That could be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away to get back the energy I used for the interaction with you."
Try to feel when a communitone of sociality is exhausted - and send him a text message instead of knocking it.
Apropos knock: Do it.
A guy in my student homes had the idea that a unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Close friendship by baking.
Since you start the university at the highlight of the back-many, knocking at the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the greeting of the 1950s "Willing in the neighborhood, I have baked you something. So, and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions."
Offering homemade flavors is a good way to close friendships.
Your fellow residents feel obliged to entertain and at the end may associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you're a decent baker.
Bad mixed flour, sugar and fat leads to people sleeping when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in students' homes.
Of course, the clause of chicken is a thief, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea?
Check that with the milk owner.
The chances are good that they say to use themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your things, it's angry, and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it more balanced than my fellow resident who added a dishwasher to punish thieves.
She's in prison now.
You shouldn't make a noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It is not only about being a decent person, but that in the truest sense of the proverb you are among the people who sit in the glass house.
A girl on my hall asked their neighbors if they were doing something to put Drum & Bass a little less than it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an examination in the morning.
They responded with even more pure music.
Finally, when they stopped at 5 p.m., she kindly left her neighbors to sleep for two hours before she had her own music plunged, closed her door and went to her three - hour trial.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally enter the same student home?
In turn, it would not be quite embarrassing if you were to keep a co-in for your future spouse, to get back to her, to separate her and then to see her every day, and perhaps to see how she pulls all of her friends to herself?
Of course, the heart goes his own ways - but if a warm fellow resident is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk about your leg a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his unlocked room, the border between a Ulk and manipulation is finer than it seems.
A good strike is funny, but it only takes moments until it becomes a boumerang.
By hiding a valuable and amusing lesson about safety - but never waste someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer cabinet - but do not tackle their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Series houses for refugees, single-wearing, low-served
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds series houses for people who do not have much money in the middle of France.
So for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-served mother."
"I'm showing how to build beneficial and well today," says the 44-year-old in the interview
Thousands of refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
The entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes to know how quickly cheap housing can be created: He builds series houses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: The massive accommodation in containers or tournaments has no sustainability.
Because people stay here for a large part.
Given the refugee flow, we also need enough living space over the next decades.
A completely banal, three-storey row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs at least place.
It facilitates integration.
This is different if people are kept in residential blocks.
Each of the six houses that are built in the pilot project consists of three units of living for four asylum applicants each.
Each unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it's peace again, I'm going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 euros, without land.
That's overviewable.
Six months have lasted the construction.
That's appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated their plans?
Gildner: Construction law I carried out my project correctly.
Especially complicated, it always makes the threatening damocular difficulty special construction and the parking regulation.
Gruselig.
It is still provided that who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three pitches.
Only in the cities is there no place for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don't have cars.
How did the residents react to their series house project?
Gildner: There were those who suggested me to create luxury buildings for asylum applicants.
What is definitely wrong.
But do you not intensify the competition struggle for affordable apartments?
Gildner: True: We have had a construction tree in Germany over the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that can hardly afford any more.
My project has the message, also the normal people need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low-servant.
I'm showing how you can build cheaply and well today.
That's what it's about.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and first worked on environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is published
The new operating system can be requested by going to the configuration app, typing on "General" and then select "Software Update".
If it's ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation, since they receive an error message that tells that the "software update failed" has been done.
To deal with the problem, users are recommended to wait either until the storm goes down or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself leads you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space, but Apple has made this unlikely by slowing up updates. Similarly, it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is finished.
It is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple does not allow the update to be continued, as the phone may be shut down halfway and this could cause an abortion of the update.

Rosberg's only devise: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg only knows a devise in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team colleague Lewis Hamilton: "Volle Attack".
The World Cup Second stressed before starting into the decisive seven overseas race, "that I have nothing to lose".
53 points separate the vice world champion in Singapore from title defender and double champion Hamilton on this Sunday.
The British won seven of the previous twelve season races and also attacks the flood light-grrand-prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will influence the Great Price of Singapore is still unclear.
For days a dark bell hangs over the city, caused by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Schachclub has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has included another member in his series, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who stayed more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen to the Kur.
Gauselmann is a member of the Federal Merit Cross 1. Class and honourable citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The chess club in Bad Kissingen has supported Gauselmann with a donation that President Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to include chess players who cannot impose the membership contribution.
Youth work and talent search should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes that the membership of the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" will be seen as an expression of its association with the Kurstadt.
Quarter office looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Old Center Antonistift have joined themselves under the jacket of the social foundation and opened a new approach at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The social foundation draws it down from the mountain to the city centre.
More precisely at the Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new quarter office was recently opened there.
Here, immediately next to the shopping market, seniors and consultants will receive information on issues such as care insurance or services of the nursing and nursing boxes.
For years, with our ambulant nursing service, we have found that often nursing family members are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"Also many of the benefits of the cashes are not often taken into account because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new householder Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Citizens' Pitch and for the ambulant service "Amadeus".
In addition to the discussions, the new Quarter Office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The saludis was taken into the boat for this purpose.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as sturdy prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Senior Centre and the Saludis are perfectly complemented.
Saludis stands for prevention, prevention and reha.
Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis, wrote "The Senior Centre for Care and Care".
The reason for the opening of the new quarter office in the city centre, both managing directors see particularly in demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg in the future essential.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) underlined the inauguration celebrations, the Quarter Office also devotes itself to the association at age: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular gathering group."
This makes the social foundation a great contribution that seniors can live as self-employed and well in their familiar environment.
The Quarter office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o'clock, Tuesday and Thursday from 16 to 18 o'clock and Saturday from 10 o'clock to 12 o'clock.
Introducted Bamberg against Würzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it is official: After the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg had not been established for renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion against the Third-Ligists of Würzburg Kickers, the 6th October was now set as an appointment.
The meeting of the FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eight-eye final of the Bavarian football Totopocal against the third-ligist FC Würzburger Kickers was now finally terminated.
Playing at the Bamberger Fuchspark Stadium on Tuesday, October 6th, will take place at 7:00 p.m.
"We are pleased that we now know when the game is going over the stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now launched card advance sale.
It is special for our team to play against a third party.
We therefore hope for many spectators, and this is not without reason, because flood light games have a special attraction.
In the round of the last 16 teams, the FC Eintracht Bamberg took part in 2010 by victory at the districtligist 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional lovers 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB association population 2016/2017.
The title defender is SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang died 92-year-old
Karl Mang, one of the Doyens of Vienna's Architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5th at the age of 92, as the artists' house reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the artist's house loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it was said in the broadcast.
Born in 1922 in Vienna, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Lehmann during and after World War II.
Since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but also worked as a teacher, writer and institutional leader.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Forming.
In the 1980s, he was assigned to the establishment of the treasure chamber in the Vienna Hofburg and the reconstruction of the Palais Lobkowitz to the Austrian Theatre Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws policeman with money
Ex footballer Tim Wiese has not noticed well in Bremen.
Soccer was once, now Tim Wiese, former national gatekeeper in Germany and at Bremen and Hoffenheim, Wrestler.
30 kilograms of muscle mass he wants to be added in the past two years according to his own statement.
Intellectually, on the other hand, he did not.
In the city centre of Bremer, the meadow just cut the hair, when he saw an outside parking guard exhibiting a penalty record for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
White then stormed out of the business, offended the official and threw her the due fine on her feet, as the "Image" newspaper reports.
In the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The matter is still in the test," says Bremen City.
Only afterwards is decided whether meadow is displayed, or not.
Panama authorities destroy 4500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the rain forest-typical climate of the Isla del Rey are best suited for the prosperity of the marijuana plants.
For three days, the authorities of Panama have rip out the 4500 plants and burn them.
Men beat 17-year-old Afghans
Witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening at 23.45 p.m., three young men were on foot from Bad Soden to Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17 - year - old Afghane, according to the police, followed his two friends in a distance of about five meters and called on them to wait for him.
At that time the group was at the height of the bft tank station.
Three people also stayed on the grounds of the tank station.
One of these men now shouted to the youth and struck this with the fist into the face.
The victim suffered a nose bone break and blew strongly from the nose.
When his two friends hurled and sloganed on the beater, he first left his sacrifice.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator pursued the group with a car up to their apartment and passed there demonstrably several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was again attacked by the batter and another male person.
With the aid of a stack, the face and the thighs of the victim were beaten.
The injured person had to be brought to a hospital for medical care.
To date, only a vague descriptive description of the offender is available.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters.
The second blower was supposed to have been about 1.65 meters tall and was clothed with a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police ask witnesses and advisors to report on the telephone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Felstehausen and invests 310000 Euro
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Heinfried Kabbert is also delighted by Samtgemeindemeister Bernd Bormann, economic sponsor Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf's mayor.
In many places on the countryside, doctors are missing - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Felstehausen on 1 October.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retired, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still at the side of his successor in the next months with half a place.
After a reconstruction phase, Müller reopens the practice on October 12, until then he invests 310000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausens years ago met Frank Müller and his wife, Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who currently completed their medical training at the Verden Hospital and wants to get to practice next year.
"We always had in the back that the Müllers would fit well in this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughed.
"When it was done, I just called her."
The couple Müller enjoyed the idea of practicing their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years."
As a benefit, he also sees being his own boss soon.
And so they agreed, the Müllers bought the house with practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There the two-fold family father Frank Müller also grew up, his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctoral practices as well as in hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently a senior physician in Sulingen and was also appointed a senior emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and has been accredited in the DRK-Bereitschaft Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
As of 19 September, practice is being prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house physician, his wife Ursel (internistin) specialized in gastronomy.
The garbageers, both internists, want to relocate as a house doctor.
"The endoscopy therefore comes out," says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the conversion the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and load ECGs and we will need a speaker room more.
In addition, the EDV is completely renewed.
A total of EUR 50000 will be allocated to the Müllers within the framework of a support programme of the Landkreis (25000 euros) as well as the Samt Community (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that practice is being continued," stresses Samtgemeindemeister Bernd Bormann.
Some 2,000 patients, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, come into the practice of rockhouses, in the north German average practice about 500.
In Asendorf there is another Hausarzt practice.
A positive side effect of the practical takeover by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had found her, she would have gone too.
By the way, who visits Müller's speech hours continues to look primarily in familiar faces: the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens take over.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the physicians have practiced there for 30 years.
"We only had two rooms at the beginning," recalls Ursel Felstehausen smileling.
A little mourning has already experienced them after the long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients still often," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughingly: "We have a 6000-square-meter base."
"I've always pushed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
In addition, the couple has two grandsons and likes to travel.
Croatia: "We let the refugees go through"
"Now the border controls will also be driven up at our southern border," said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in parallel.
Still, it is clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application could also make this "of course".
People's care and safety are at the forefront.
But be sure, "that it needs clear signals," said the minister.
People must know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, nor over the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "Korridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously notified that Slovenia also wanted to continue coming refugees to Austria and Germany and may also build corridors for refugees.
In this way, however, this interior minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach did not see.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia will intensify the monitoring of the border, especially Hungary.
The border with Croatia, however, was already severely controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenian does not want to lock its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system cannot function," said Györkös Znidar.
As the Croatian government noted, the first refugees had already tried to pass in eastern Croatia on the border crossing of Tovarnik/Sid to avoid registration during the night hours.
The Croatian police were able to catch them in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, in the Croatian Tovarnik, police vehicles have been constantly entering new refugees.
It mainly concerns Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use.
In the coming days, his country was counted with some 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would redirect towards Croatia, reports Croatian and Serbian media in agreement on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, argues that it is for the people to make certain routes: "We can neither do nor want to do this," it said.
According to the media reports, a first bus with about 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of Sid had arrived in the early morning, and further buses would be expected over the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had traveled all night from the 500 kilometers away Macedonian border through Serbia.
"We have heard that Hungary has made it, so the police told us that we should go here," said one of the refugees.
They wanted to continue traveling to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could, in fact, lead to a somewhat further western route for the shift of the former Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Mazedonia-Serbia-Serbien-Hungary.
Croatia: Comprehensive possibilities for border control
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not mention details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "increasing opportunities for border control".
strict controls are being carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007, and the EU partners have been making a good witness to the country since then as regards the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border.
According to Belgrade’s media reports, they would have spent last night on the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings of Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely locked.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to relieve Wednesday early at a local illusion in Horgos: He considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, premature.
It would not be a very high number of refugees at present.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute to refugees maps on which alternative routes are registered by Croatia.
However, the cross-border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous: in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still unpaid mine fields.
On Wednesday afternoon, the Croatian police announced that a team of mine roommen was sent to the border region.
Stock exchange hacker: Ukrainen pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is supposed to have belonged to a ring of cyber criminals, which is suggested that since 2010 insight into still unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire have been continuing.
Insider businesses should have been made in the financial markets with the utilised information.
According to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were awarded in this way.
"The present comparison shows that even those outside our country borders are finally caught," says the SEC Communication.
The trials against 32 more accused in the case lasted.
Most of the defendants originate from Ukraine and Georgia.
The offenders are said to have acted in both the USA and Eastern Europe.
Occumenic Hospiz Help Mannheim has existed for 20 years
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz, there is a regular operation.
People do their concerns, partially fast steps, partly cozy bumping.
They control the two stations of the Mannheimer Autosalon at the Paradeplatz.
Maintain city trains.
Pulsating, stunning life with magnificent autumn sunshine and in the middle four large tablets each with the heading "Before I want to die."...
With this action, the ecumenical hospice aid brought attention to their 20-year existence and is confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josephine Lammer.
The Head of Economic Hospice Assistance is available to the passer as well as to questions and discussions as to the Hospice Staff.
While some passer spontaneously grabs the creed and the phrase "yes, yes, my life," "read", "with which camper drives through the USA", "stop the war" or "not long suffering", others stay short, read, say phrases like "so far I am not yet" and then continue.
At the edge, small discussions on the action in itself, on life, on dealing with dying develop again and again.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
"Only if I make it clear that the end of this world will come to me sometime, I can live responsibly," says the director of the Diakonic Work Mannheim, who is jointly with the Caritas Association of the Oecumenical Hospiz Assistance.
This public action for the 20-year-old is therefore good.
That not everyone wants to distribute on the tables publicly, however, is understandable, finally it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still covered by Tabus, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the Hospiz movement in recent years has contributed much to the opening of people.
An assessment that Angelika shares Godefroid.
The death and grief companion is one of the honourable employees of the first hour.
Personal experience confronted with the topic, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in the death aid.
When the ecumenical hospice aid was looking for honourable officials by call, it immediately reported and was involved at the founding in 1995.
Godefroid belongs to a team of 45 honourable men - 43 women and two men - accompanied the affected and family in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and in the Hospiz Sankt Vincent.
They're all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can handle well with its task and experiences and experiences.
"I see the life of another wait, think it is precious and appreciate the moment," she says.
The offer of the ambulant ecumenical hospice service is free and independent of confession.
The financial support of the health insurance and donations of members and associations enables training and training and supervision of the mortal and grief companions.
Every two years training is offered for new employees.
The tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Protestant Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Additional personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards there.
FedEx result mixed, financial prospects reduced for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supplier giant lowered its profit prospects for a whole year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its soil transport service.
The company also said that she plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday time.
The share fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to earn a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the financial year that ends next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84 according to a survey of FactSet.
The lower prospect comes despite the price increases, which are an average of 4.9% and will be effective on 4 January and despite higher increases in soil transports of heavy and large packages collected from November.
The company said that it still expected that the result would increase over the previous year due to cost reductions, higher revenues and growth in online trade.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company "produces solid yields when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The plans for holiday employment were announced a day later than that of the Rival UPS, which plans to stop 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, such as the same number as last year.
In the quarter that ended on August 31, FedEx earned 692 million dollars, 6 percent more than in the previous year.
The result per share amounted to $2.42 per share, nearly after the $2.44 per share, the twelve interviewed by Zacks Investment Research predicted analysts.
Turnover increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six of Zacks interviewed analysts expected $12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority broadcasting that has brought sales into stagnation in its unit of express shipping.
But the tree in the online shopping has increased the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, sales in soil transport increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while the result decreased due to higher labour costs in the freight business.
In the premarket trade, about an hour before opening, the FedEx shares fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11.
At their most expected meeting in the year, Federal Reserve Strategen spends two days this week around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it is time for the first time to raise the guiding interest for almost a decade.
A wall image of the United States is threatened over them at the end of the decorated, two-storey sitting room.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all other things.
The Central Bank has a two-fold commission from the Congress: maintaining a stable maximum of US employment and prices here.
But since the great recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start to be dealt with by the unprecedented incentive by the short-term interest rate close to zero since the end of 2008.
Although most data in the economy show that they are growing solidly, the recent turbulences in the global financial markets could scare the already cautious Fed representatives to increase this volatility by increasing the interest rate for federal bonds - and be only a quarter percentage point.
"The labour market and inflation will obviously be the most important thing they observe," said Lindsey M. Piegza, Chief Economy at the Maklerfirma Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think, if they were looking for a pretext not to increase the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself uncertains the financial market.
About half the economists recently interviewed by Bloomberg predicted an increase in interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets expect Fed to wait with a key indicator, which represents only a 30% chance to increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, unless the strategists smile down the stroke by promiseing that another increase is far away.
On Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial Average value rang by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16.599.85.
The action was triggered by expectations that the Fed policy will maintain the sentence this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed lifted the sentences at that time," he said.
If she does, "they would have to go very far in their statement to calm down the financial markets so that they would not be paniced."
Other experts argued that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Even a month ago, the Fed seemed in a good way to increase the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slowly sharpening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA.
Yellen had said in spring and early summer that this year, despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed, it expected an increase in the rate.
Although the creation of jobs slowed down in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate decreased to 5.1% last month, the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the Fed considers to be full employment.
Wages increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2% of the central bank, the Fed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconoms, said that the economy can "have higher interest rates and need them because of the stress in the labour market.
But the financial markets around the world collaborated at the end of last month after China evaluated its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average in May fell by more than 16% below its highest level, as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would disrupt global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, while the Dow is now nearly 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates.
"If the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would be attracting the trick at this meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, Senior Research Fellow at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee at the US Notenbank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better managed.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the effects on the US economy will be, and there is almost no reliable data that describes the developments in China," said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the final effect, the Fed Monetary Authority has become the world.
The central bank's influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere notice of the then director Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could "verengen" its monetary expansion, triggered confusions around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly tied together, Fed representatives can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult with other central banks and experts to improve their understanding of the global economy.
Their decision is "more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy for the assets management of Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that "the Fed has a history of overreactions on financial market movements that seem to be not linked to the economic fundamental data."
Lacker, voted member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who intends to increase interest rates, quoted decisions as an example in 1998/1999.
A financial crisis in Asia caused Fed to reduce its leading interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings "thirds of limited recognizable effects on growth in the USA", said Lacker.
A year later, the Fed representatives reversed these cuts.
The Fed should first place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the 2008 market collapse, said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England Interest Planning Committee.
The recent turbulences are not near this level, he said.
"She certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest rates because the markets are rising," said Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not think it should go ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown

There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The shop is huge, and it takes over an hour to wandering through the gangs.
If the whole shopping shop makes you hungry, there is a meal for you in the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The garage (good and price) in this store is close to the boxes and has various take-up options.
What there is here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
It's probably LAX-C.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Little life aid for refugees
More and more refugees arrive in Germany these days.
Making a warm welcome to you does not go without the engagement of countless honorary helpers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who support asylum applicants in the city.
They include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday she does it in the asylum applicant's home on Dillinger Street.
It helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is quite different from a right school.
Brazil's paediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS tries to inform women in a shocking way about how important good diet is during breastfeeding. It does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that suck on breasts painted with images of unhealthy food.
Mother milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories a day.
However, new research results suggest that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, Professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can adversely affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernried Sports Hall
The municipal council Bernried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euro expensive sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flattered for solar plants.
The plans for the long-secured tournament building at the Bernried Sports Area are step-by-step: In the recent municipal council meeting, the draft construction request was unanimously rejected without major discussions.
Previously, the Board had decided, inter alia, an application for a building-law exception, respective "freedom" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" concerns the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "saddle roof with non-middly first and roof overlapping" is to be built.
The background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar plants: "This brings us together a wonderful large south roof," said Mayor Josef Steigenberger at the meeting.
On the other hand, the "freedom" concerns the roofclothing, which should be lower than ten degrees for energetic reasons, unlike the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is significantly reduced.
A "freedom" was needed because the construction plan on the roof hooking does not allow "exceptions" - whereby the Bernried Council usually operates more restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, it is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," says Steigenberger.
Turnhallenbau at the Sports Center is a joint project of the municipality and the SV Bernried.
Approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated at costs.
Subsidy is expected from the promotion of school and wide sports.
In the next process step, the application for construction for the 18 x 36 meters large hall is now submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes new medical director at the Hospital Schongau.
The station as well as the majority of employees move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is the surprising plans of the Landkreis Hospital GmbH, confirmed by Land Councilman Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, the Supervisory Board shall take a decision on this matter and will be held on Wednesday 23 September.
If the plans were implemented, all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The majority should move to Schongau with fishermen and the ongoing internal station.
The rooms are available.
The employees who can't go to Schongau are to be offered a job in Weilheim, says Jochner-Weiß.
Employees should be informed of the plans.
The change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been the medical director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and now switches to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital.
In the question of who the succession should take place, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fisher" came into the game, which declared himself ready to take the lead from October 1st and switch to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau this in any case means a "revaluation" and a spread of the offer in the field of "Innere Medizin", says Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist for heart stepmakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastronological diseases at the interior station.
For the next two years, fishermen and their team, if the Supervisory Board agree with them, will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Cockpit, which still has 35 beds, should be finally closed in Peißenberg after nearly 140 years.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018 when the current renovation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Land-Rätin Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, reproached that the house owned by the Federal Crime will be used as accommodation for asylum webers in the future.
As the property continues, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there are several considerations.
There is currently a short-term care of the Caritas and a daily psychiatrie.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity does not come again," said Fischer about the quasi move to the Lech, which was "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house in which fishermen have been working as a chief for over 30 years has not existed.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director.
In recent decades, the Peißenberg Hospital (early 100 beds) has been threatened by closure, divisions have been closed, for example surgery and birth aid.
The handballers of the Rhine-Neckar Löwen are required tonight (20.15 o'clock) at the Bergische HC.
The Bundesliga table leader is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for superbness.
During the past season, the bathers had a painful defeat at the BHC and have a little good to do there.
Hunting accident with two injured persons at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were severely injured by shots during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the butnt on a maize field near Pratau, Wittenberg County, several hunters were employed, as the police told.
After a shot, a 63- and 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and was brought to hospitals.
How exactly it could come to the accident was initially unclear.
The Criminal Police Determined.
Missed 16-year-olds from Rhineland-Palatinate victims of violence
A suspect has led the police to the body of the 16-year-olds missing from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the trial, the 20-year-old admitted to killing young people and throwing their body into a channel in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old missing from Rhineland-Palatinate has been victim of violence since Saturday.
The body of the young woman was found in Rockenhausen on Tuesday evening, near Kaiserslautern, as state attorney and police informed on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old, also arrested on Tuesday evening, is deemed to be deemed to be an act and the investigators led to the discovery of the body.
The 16-year-old had been notified on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed on a visit to a autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In search of the young woman, the investigators first found personal objects of the victim.
In the case of interviews in the group of friends and acquaintances of losers, there was finally a suspicion of acts against the 20-year-old.
The suspected offender then led the police to a channel in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the arrest, in the police interview, the 16-year-old killed and put the body in the channel.
The 20-year-old should be presented to the prisoner on Wednesday, the investigators will put him to death.
Further investigations should be carried out in detail on the circumstances of action.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns against housing gap
The location on the German housing market is stressed.
More and more refugees are also looking for a payable stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long started.
With the incoming refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing for a market that has already been overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens around the last affordable apartments.
In order to cover the demand for affordable apartments, 400 000 new units should be built each year by 2020.
The result is a study on behalf of the Association "Social Housing Building".
For comparison: This year 260,000 units are finished in Germany.
That's why 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live asylum seekers in a first-taking accommodation.
Many then rush into the housing market and rank into the long snakes before the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum applicants lived for rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also constitutes significant failures in housing policy over the last few years.
Germany creates a shortage of housing, which grows from year to year.
Currently, some 770,000 residential units were already missing in the balancing areas, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG rooms.
Young adults remained involuntarily longer in the "Hotel Mama" because of the flaut on the housing market.
In the large cities, the number of square meters per capita has been reduced for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the Alliance "Social housing" proposes a new start.
New incentives are to stimulate social housing.
In this way, the basic acquisition tax could be refrained and the basic tax for funded apartments would be suspended in the short term.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are necessary.
The State Bank KfW support programme for refugee accommodations already comes well with cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, with EUR 184 million on Monday evening, more than half of the EUR 300 million available had already been collected.
Now the project could even be increased.
Refugees have free guidance: Croatia and Slovenia initiate corridor
To Hungary, there is virtually no longer a passion, as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that he should pass through Slovenia to the north without hurdles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a Corridor for Refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," said Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the abolition of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have gone to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe.
500 people had passed over the border with Tovarnik, reports the Croatian TV broadcaster RTL.
Hungary had locked its border for refugees on the preceding day.
New laws, which entered into force on the same day, make the proper asylum procedure in Hungary practically obsolete.
Croatia wants refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, there were people who did not want to live in Croatia.
In the morning, the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country Croatia.
According to Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, most of the media reported.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid with both the bus and taxes.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to reach Croatia on foot over the green border.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not hit borders.
The border strike presents other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mining spacers are now supposed to create a safe passage quickly.
However, after the closure of the border, there are hardly more refugees in Hungary.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people attacked.
Just before the end of the door on Monday, it was 9380.
The new Hungarian laws act as a criminal offence to overcome and damage the border fence.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
The convicts threaten imprisonment for up to five years and the deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the newly established "transitons" on Tuesday, almost all of which - 93 - were the most important transition to Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees would still have been there.
Practically, however, no one has an opportunity to get asylum in Hungary.
In Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
The rejected asylum applicants are to be deported there.
Before the "transit zone" in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees gathered.
In Röszke, workers started to clean up.
They collected the waste that tens of thousands of people had left on the roadside in recent weeks.
Lock grottes were demolished and one of the recording camps in the border site was rebuilt.
No one wanted to express himself for the purpose of this transformation.
Austria is still reaching few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
However, around 20,000 migrants still stayed in the country according to government statements.
In Salzburg about 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
The train traffic from there to Germany was stopped on instruction from German authorities in the morning.
Smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot in the liberation.
Mayor drove over the border
"We were busy cleaning up on Sunday after the bridge festival, when suddenly ten people stood with suitcases at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted the train to passau.
But because of the fleeing flow, Germany had surprisingly stopped the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday, it was concluded for them in Wernstein", said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and the beaches together with two other helpers and their cars chauffed across the border to the near passau.
Previously, we have sold the unpopular guests with jause and drinks.
We just said we'll take her to Passau by car.
"That was of course for us," says Stadler in the OÖN talk.
You were very grateful.
A man could not take it to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the firefighter.
"We have been very happy with that," says Stadler.
On Sunday evening, the train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau to try over the border after the short-term announcement that rail transport to Germany was stopped.
However, the regional train was posted before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, the cross-border is generally high in the course.
The bridge festival associated with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, a two-bridge race sports - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán now sends us another zig thousand, is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of helping in the Röszke camp immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has brought the Hungarian government’s position into the thin circle of national socialism in the public.
The suffering of this policy is not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to find that the "promised country" she invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a great challenge to create, in the face of the persistent refugee flows and the close winter, human-worthy conditions for protective seekers.
And it will be even greater - maintaining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad looking for 35,000 winter-fest quarters
Conrad has all the hands full to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen Banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first recording center of Traiskirchen has already managed Konrad.
"We have no more homeless in Traiskirchen," he reported of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees, who had come to Austria on Monday, had also been without a big spine, said Konrad and praised the organizational "master performance".
On the other hand, the Ministry of Interior spoke of a "crisical situation".
Overall, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters in the year.
In order to meet the number, there are still 35,000 accommodations to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide the countries, 15,000 of the covenant.
If it becomes more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without soil," Konrad said.
He has already talked with the heads of the country.
They would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-Mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, whereby it is to be clarified how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations into the ORF action "Helfs like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer simple accommodations.
In addition, you are hoping for hotels that are empty in the winter.
Conrad and Maier criticized the standards for accommodation yesterday as "very high".
In emergency times, it could not be that quartierers have to maintain a certain height of the towel holders or size of the upper lamps.
"Notstandards" should apply for a period of time.
The fact that, in contrast to the Ministry of Interior, he was more successful in housing, Konrad founded with his experience.
I am an older lord, who isn't without any further in the face of untruth.
Convictional power is his most important weapon.
Conrad and Maier do not cost the Republic as they explained themselves.
Their number of employees wants to increase them to three to four.
Your own quartier search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there seem to be problems with approval.
Linz demands a better division
First, no opening urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees the city of Linz plans.
This is not necessary at the moment, since the affected people could currently be kept without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, further locations should be examined for the emergency.
The head of town criticizes the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to contribute to this.
Seehofer: "No borders are locked"
In a longer phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), head of State Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on Monday on the further action in the refugee question.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders are not closed.
The continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic would continue to be possible.
However, there are now just the relevant border controls.
Special trains with refugees to Germany will not be any more.
However, the protection seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for more solidarity in the refugee issue by the other EU Member States.
The fact that Austria again introduces controls on its borders is "a logical result" for Pühringer from the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a question of time
The general organization of the "New Ship" in the Linzer Industry Line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the S&T exchange-based IT group has been drawn up, and the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young innovative technology companies.
"In IT, the smart heads are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us," says S&T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later approving any.
From the beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Niederhauser promises: "The next Runtastic is just one question of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the location, 3.3 million euros from the Techcenter, which belongs to one third of the city of Linz, the country of Upper Austria and the FFG.
The building is paved by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2700 square meters rest area in the building are already rented, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opened second business in the Arkade
The new shop focuses on Furla handbags.
Actually, Jutta Breit wanted to lay up a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project shortly in the Taubenmarkt-Arcade: she has now grown in the form of another business place.
In the Furla shop compared to the shop in which they sell bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes of various manufacturers, everything is about women's handbags of the brand Furla, money exchanges are available from 75 euros.
Larger pockets and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
Since yesterday the new shop has been in operation.
A few weeks earlier was rebuilt.
"But I have a long time thought if I should open another store," Breit says.
One of the key factors for the decision was that the Furla producers who are at home in Bologna were also touched by the idea of their own location where only their handbags are sold.
"We're the only ones in Linz's large area who sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has put Breit into the cradle from her mother.
I'm most taunted when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why some woman gets in a handbag when looking at a beautiful handbag, the specialist cannot answer with certainty.
Maybe it's because a nice bag of every outfit is upgrading.
The roller maker from Kallstadt
The palaces ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called the host.
This property also combines some with the billionary who wants to become President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitements.
Whether he expresses himself opposed to foreigners, concerns journalists or reveals gaps of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. presidential Office inhibits the campaign strongly.
And cut off well.
This is also recorded in the Poolish Kallstadt, where the grandparents of the real estate military originate.
The New Yorker with the hairdresser is a term for many in the wine village on the wine street.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place are related to it over -thirty corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in electoral mode.
The Kallstadt Simone Wendel turned a movie about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but in their Kallstadt style they are not so deeply impressed," says Simone Wendel.
The born Kallstadt has turned an amusing documentary film about the place and its famous spears, which also counts the Ketchup family Heinz next to Trump.
Trump, not known for modesty, is also spoken in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014), so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn't bring it to the King of the Heart there.
Although there is respect for the performance of the family, it also tends to think that Trump "being a little a grandmill", Wendel says.
Randomly, the nickname that Kallstadt has in the surroundings is "The Brulljesmacher" - to the High German: the authors, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of the hosts.
The Trump's success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigrated and opened a local for gold tombs in the USA.
The groundstone of the real estate company was first purchase in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragic: your desire to return to home permanently failed in the Bavarian State, to which the Pfalz then belonged.
He hadn't taken Trump because he had once been cut off without permission, the director of the Institute for Criminal History and Volkskunde, Roland Paul, had declared a movie launch.
Trump was the grandson of an "illegal emigrant".
This is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken of mexican immigrants in the U.S. and asked for the construction of a border wall to scare illegal immigrants.
"As the potter, this is not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a remote relative Trumps ("The Grandma was a born Trump, the Opa was born Heinz").
The winner in retirement sees the American rather distanzed, "he's always so brown."
Does he think Trump's coming here?
"I can't imagine that," says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared for Kallstadt."
The pension holder Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadter, that a native of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ when visiting.
"I can't imagine that from the Donald," says the 68-year-old.
She finds it better if he doesn't make the choice, because "he has such radical views, I don't know if that's good."
If those who had the legend in the U.S. at the time of his grandfather would have been like him, "he would never have arrived there at all."
"There are more interesting topics than him," says Winzertochter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
"My President isn't," she says.
And: "The grapes will be ripe without the President Trump."
Wendels Film, for which Trump was interviewed for a long time, saw 12 000 cinemas, even in the United States.
The oberbayerian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "Bergsteigerdorf".
From the hand of the Vice-President at the Deutsche Alpenverein, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant-Dorf in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
In Austria there are already 20 "Bergsteiger Dörfers".
In the neighbouring country, the alpine association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "Bergsteigerdorf" may have a population of up to 2500.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protection area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the reviews, despite the attempts of Nine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson hurry to Canberra to report after the loss of the leadership of the liberals, but it has not made any major shifts in the reviews for today.
The breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the capital of the Federal Republic of Malcolm Turnbull as the fall of Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, with the moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was part of a weekly series of international television broadcasts, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance seemed to be no role for Australian TV viewers, since Sunrise achieved an average of 397,000 viewers in the five major cities, compared to Today 339.000.
Today achieved a slight increase in the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but his number remained behind the last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
Today reached an average of 318,000 in August compared to the 330,000 of Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349.000 viewers on 314,000 today.
This is the most interesting thing happening every morning.
The winds of change concern these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for the review!

The great novelty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decided to stay with his two children on the New Zealand coast, reached a very impressive number of 1.219 million spectators.
Criters had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show Solo without the Rafters Star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear "Yes".
The X factor of Seven remained strongly with 1,136 million viewers and easily hit The Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on the evening two of The Chase Australia.

The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Eddie McGuires Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening the first half hour of The Chase Australia achieved 520,000 spectators and in the second half hour sat 720,000.
Hot Seat on average 620,000.
The decline in the second evening of The Chase Australia will be confident that hot Seat will end up at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a substitute for millions of dollars minute that didn't manage to overfly the McGuires show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Secret Revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who won The Bachelor.
The woman, at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor, was devoured in the greatest secret.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not give up whether she is the one who has received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavon's Fellows a day before we get out of three, you may accidentally have given a hint of who the winner will be.
Sam Wood keeps his lips firmly sealed up to the final on Thursday
All three women have left out lyrically about why Wood is the perfect man, calling his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked "If not you, who should receive Wood's last rose?", their answers could become the decayer who won the heart of the Bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly - except themselves - called Mackay as the best partner for wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other from the first day.
"From the moment I went into the house and noticed (Sarahs) and Sam's energies, I felt that they were quite compatible, and I thought that throughout the course of the show," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the earth, it's so fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I saw them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and the family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreservedly set on him," she said.
And when she was asked who should choose Wood, if not she, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls likewise - it's a difference between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor is emitted to ten on Wednesday 19:30 p.m.

Jerryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and Trainer Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some trainers would have banned Hayne to the bank for the rest of the game when he lost a rank as the Aussie-Rugby-Liga-Conversion did at his first point return on Tuesday at the 20-3 victory against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to return a point and also to the running game after a violation of Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing cabin after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also strengthened Hayne publicly in his press conference after the game.
The 49th sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his pasted catch and take care of the next game.
Jerryd Hayne passes at a point that was restored in the first game quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It was certainly not the start, the Hayne and his massive Australian success for his NFL debut.
After the fumble, Hayne left the field, and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy to 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start in his NFL career,
"That was a thing that happens now, you only take care of the next game, and that's it," said Hayne.
Hayne compared the snitzer with his origin debut in 2007 when a passport in his own in-goal area led to a trial for Queensland.
In total, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans, holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his instagram.
Elton John and the Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss the rights of the Schwulen

The free voters demand the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees.
At the beginning of the FW heritage clause in Großwallstadt, the Head of Party and Group Hubert Aiwanger warned against a serious crisis in Bavaria's schools when there are no new teachers according to the many new students: "We need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep schools from collapse," said Aiwanger.
"Sometimes we'll get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfraction of the Free Ecclesiastes arrives in the Underfranch municipality until Friday.
Actually, different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees is now also dominating the free voters meeting.
"Of course, the theme of asylum will overlay the Klausur," said Aiwanger.
Aivwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as it was during the Yugoslavia war in the 1990s.
"So it doesn't go on, we need to get to the causes," said the Free Choir Chief.
Rejected asylum applicants want to postpone the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why pregnancy also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum complaints: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," said Aiwanger.
The FW Chief criticized that several federal states were not consistent: "We need uniform standards throughout the federal states."
"Bayers are pushing off, others don't."
"There's got to be more negotiating."
However, country policy in Großwallstadt is not to fall under the table.
A long-term burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Kultusminister Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot experiment "Medium Level plus" at 47 Gymnasia, in which an extension of the gymnasial median level is tested from three to four years - as a result it takes again nine years to the abitur.
But this is not far enough.
"The theme of G9 needs to be accelerated," said the FW chief.
We demand freedom of choice for all the gymnasias who want this.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.

4 people killed after policemen shoot rubber boots on demonstrators in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber floors into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, said an official on Wednesday.
The violence broke out in the Rupandehi District on Tuesday evening, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, head of district officials, said that more than 1,000 demonstrators had gathered outside a police station, with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before she took back on rubber floors.
20 policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber floors used, known to kill, which are traditionally used as less fatal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The conflict was the last week of violent protests in Nepal's southern levels, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say that new provinces forming under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent conflicts since the 10th century.
August, when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally ruled for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft Constitution in Kathmandu, and officials said that the new Constitution could enter into force on Sunday.

For months there had been negotiated, grieved, debated, and drawn behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new cottage settlement on the Small Sea are on the table near Emden.
The Interest, the medium-sized Emder Company "System-Bau", presented its plans for the first time in the City Development Committee of the Emder Council on Monday evening.
This point had originally been on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP franchise that pushed the investor and the administration secret creamery, Ralf Behrends went from the system building management into the offensive: "We don't have an answer to all questions yet," he said before the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to meet all the rumors now.
The 10 to 12 million euros of expensive projects have been under discussion for months.
Hefty reactions among sea-boy owners who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, sea-boy owner and board member at the representation of the investors, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant clothe that excels all the other buildings."
He also fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would grow strongly through the planned size of the plant: "There must be entire bus charges to expect it," says Schulz
However, what happens exactly on the good acre large area of the former restaurant is still open.
There's no operator yet.
"First we have to have a conclusive concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans were still variable.
Twinding's offspring at Gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo welcomes young people with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian has born twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last in a German zoo is almost 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, it says of the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet firm, as Mother Dian has so far kept them close to the body.
First, the "image" had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance for cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center predicted on Tuesday a wide downprint system of about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance to develop into a tropical storm in the next 48 hours.
Another well defined low pressure system, such as in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical storm in the next two days, added the weather experts placed in Miami.
Google starts double donation campaign to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL. O) announced a double donation campaign that is supposed to produce $11 million for humanitarian organisations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed the European nations, as they flee from war-breaked and poor countries.
Google has an unusual personal approach when announcing the donation call on his blog.
Instead of letting a manager announce, Rita Masoud, a Google worker who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our journey included many dark railway and bus rides, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: doctors without limits, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief are doubled to $11 million.
Europe has been faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also fled from the war-run Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study.
It's too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on weight loss chirurgy, who wrote a guide article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations or adipositas chirurgy, use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to absorb food.
Over the years, adipositas operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes have proven efficient, but most studies have been conducted in people who are sickly obscure with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight in relation to size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obesity.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of adipositas chirurgy - Magenbypass and stomach tube formation - for medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.5 to the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI remained with those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29.
Among those undergoing surgery, a total of 36% dissolved diabetes disease and 28% partially.
In the medically-treated group, compared with diabetes, only one percent and partly only about two percent were dissolved.
In addition, the results of the controls of blood pressure, triglyceride and "bad" LDL cholesterol "in general were better in the 'surgical' group", the authors found out.
The researchers also monitored the patient blood levels of haemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average haemoglobin A1c level decreased from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
However, in the medical therapy group it remained stable at approximately 8 percent.
But this better "glycaemic control" - as you reflect in the improved hemoglobine A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to the leading researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the Bypass-Chirurgie Group had lost more weight in comparison to the gas tractomy group (18.7 vs 14.2 kg), reached larger decreases in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobine A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and recorded a complete overwhelming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study shows no survival advantage of survival after five years, there is evidence from a study of severer people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, it was likely to die for about 29 percent less in the course of 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients, Blackstone said it was soothing for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"This is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group," she said without increased risk of death or kidney disease.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with his BMI is between 27 and 30.
"I think we're waiting too long for people to take this seriously," she said.
I think that once they have collected these genetic changes, which have closely linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really difficult."
Love Story Plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasing attention in Belletristic: a young woman, unpopular and unthinkable at schooltimes, meets the swarm of her youth after years, and he is in love with her.
Likewise, in the recently published novel "We are not really so" by Luisa Binder.
Besides the story of love, the novel should be particularly interesting for Hunsrück readers, for he plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author has grown up in Langweiler and is pleased that she could set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe could not take all refugees, said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader urged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the persistent refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents under the circumstances given.
He also stressed that although the response of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama and Austria's efforts in coping with the crisis praised, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"To take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions as a real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we need to consider how killing is reduced in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The application of violence has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush's actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and pointed out that the violent reaction of the USA attracted a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 11 September, I expressed my condolence in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem is in violencelessness.
"I know his motives were good, but he committed violence, and this caused unexpected consequences," said Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increases in use of hand disinfectants by children over the past 4 years
Toxic control centres in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow strongly alcoholic hand disinfectants, says Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the cases of hand-desinfection in children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are getting more and more often on these products, and, unfortunately, a percentage of them are going into emergency recording," said Lopez CNN.
He said that some children intentionally drink disinfectants, while some do it to impress their friends or for a mourning sample in the social media.
Videos on YouTube show how young people drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Adolescents are said to have mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwater to obtain a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by attractive scents of disinfectants.
"A child doesn't think this is bad for it," said Lopez.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those who are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberries, grapes and orange fragrances that are very appealing to children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in small children, few syringes can lead to alcohol poisoning.
"It is highly concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Toxic Notice Call Centre at the University of Kansas, Sender Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So you wouldn't let a swallow whisky stand around, but people leave this hand disinfectant in the range of children, and when children get there, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old girl who had recently taken four syringes from a fragrant hand disinfectant in the school after earthberry, was brought to an emergency recording.
Their blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice higher than the threshold, which is considered to be drunk in an adult by law, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency doctor who treated it at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lamented her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency recording.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital on signs of brain dreama, since the girl had fallen by alcohol and had pushed her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very scary," said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectants and to store hand disinfectants outside the child's reach.
Apart from alcohol poisoning, some desinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died women after swallowing hand disinfectants that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a fatal solution instead of ethyl alcohol, which was noted as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the State of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by interpreting anti-bacterial products around the classroom," reports a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectants and expelled them from her room.
The police viewed the cursed plan as "sweats" and pointed disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen swifts: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been easily injured in case of an accident on the crossing between Nordring and On Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossroads towards circuit transport industrial area and noticed too late that two pre-driven vehicles had stopped on circuit transport.
As a result, he collapsed with his truck into the rear of an audit and pushed this vehicle to a leading Ford Fiesta.
The police notify that the accidental cars were damaged by about 10 000 euros.
The audit of the 33-year-old was no longer ready to drive and had to be pulled off.

Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors about disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which has been spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, which meant that he and his teammates are not under increased control because they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don't think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football borings Dutch - de Boer
The former Rangers middle field player and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic, since there is no title rituality with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland they do not show any highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They're talking about both teams together and that's what they're interested.
There is a lot of tension in the old company games, and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic had to fight, but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat against 10 men from Aberdeen followed, which are now clearly at the top of the table with five points.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back."
Now we want to get out as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what happens.
We feel that way - but we have to go on.
We really need the support of Celtic because that makes players better.
Now standing together is so important.
Warburton caution with January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago, which suggested that he was calling some January transfers, Rangers-Boss Mark Warburton is careful in signing new accesses and persists that he does not want to interfere with the unity of the Ibrox cader.
The ex-chief of Brentford said: "The January-Transfer window is very different from summer window."
The players who come in summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target person Michu with retraction instruction
Swansea storms Michu, with Celtic during the transfer period in conversation, suggested that he could withdraw when his contract expires with the Swans.

Hearts eingestellt to SFA Battle for Neilson's Comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent from the field and then lost 3:2, but the Red Card of the Defender was later lifted up - the third Red Card of Collum, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson stays with what he said, and persists, "I haven't questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynecastle
The unimproved Hibee was corrected after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive lyrics about Ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a kneipe in the area of Roseburn in Edinburgh before a Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a Derby, and it was the heat of the moment," said the storm and added, "It is sure to say that I don't return to Tynecastle if it doesn't play for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee-United Management

I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll bring the boys back to Trab," said Donnelly.
McInnes happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his team from Aberdeen had to desperately fight against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh successive League victory that brought them a five-point advance before Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's Elfmeter in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that won everything in pocal games or lying games that haven't even won such games."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, as it increases in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in May to July, while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate was 5.9% above the UK's 5.5%, as shown by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12.000 during the three months, with the number of employees now being 2.612.000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
The Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell commented on the latest figures and said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundationstone for a stronger economy."
It is almost a year ago that Scotland has made the historical decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment.
Drunken people disturbed the process
Since the security staff could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray were officials able to take the disturbances into custody.
An atemal coholtest produced 0.89 promille at a 16-year-old.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promilles and remained in custody first.
Why I'm going to be witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Something later today, except for late legal intervention, I will see how a man is killed.
When it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber in the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the toxic syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation was already made for the first time in January over his best friend, and even though I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists can see executions in the United States, and as more applications are often available than places, a macabere lottery takes place to decide who is chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will watch it emotionslessly.
I can't.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship with telephones over the months and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of giving up my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it, and you get access.
I complain with her.
She admitted that she could've made it better, but she still thinks it's wrong what I'm doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks the public work of the movement will help against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please hear the series of podcasts I made.
I don't want to go back to all the details.
I can't be sure to say Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of action.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I'll see him die.
I can't claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you'll get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man after moist police pursuit persuades to come out of the Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry when he convinced the man of the Canning River.
An attempt of a man from Perth to depend on the police was unsuccessful when he was in the silk and moist water, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to "convince him gentlely to return to the shore."
The police of Canning Vale were called on Tuesday to a house peace breaking incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them in the direction of Canning River.
But he didn't get too far.
"He stood in the water and said, "I don't come out, come and get me," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiated".
"Many people do fun things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Champion football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006 Cousins drove his car into the graves to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that Stewards tried to spy him out and threatens to end the race
Peter Moody claims that Stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He aimed at the Stewards and the Integrity Department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they were performing a personal campaign against him with the Late Scratching of Lady Tatai for a racing day treatment, the last strooihalm on Wednesday.
Moody said Fairfax Media that he had always tried to do what was best for race sports and he had found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobalt tupfer sample at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held himself 18 months because of the spionage predictions and didn't want it to "look out like too high hanging grapes."
"I had to say nothing about it, and I've sat for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," said Moody.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to go around elevated heads, and I want my owners to think I'm trying my best for them.
If they start thinking, I don't do this, then I shouldn't be a coach anymore.
I have to consider what I'm doing with my license.
Previously, Moody had let the bomb go up in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his steal.
"At eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - which I will call when I'm asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I'm doing within my hall," said Moody on Racing.com.
They obviously believe I'm a fraudor.
If that is the case, they should surely take their nose because they have failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former President of the RVL, David Moodie, President of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still.
Should that make me think it's gonna be personal?
Has the RVL acted featherously and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is happening in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and dismiss me, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying now let them think about it.
But I've arrived at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I'll put pressure on them and press them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The tractor's frustration necessities have been built with the long-term cobalt examination at Lidari, and Late Scratching led him to say that he could "give his license over the table."
Moody, best known by his preparation of the unshaked master Black Caviar, referred to the racing day treatment rule as "shameful", after a pack of mud or tone had been applied to the horse legs, which was contrary to the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
"One of my employees has miserably put mud on the leg.
It could have been like that last night.
It could have been like that all day yesterday.
But it had it on the race day too.
Moody could be confronted with a three-month disqualification for the treatment of the packing on the race day. An investigation of this matter was opened.
It's a joke.
People who set up these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We all see that we need rules, but here you go too far," said Moody.
Man arrested after driver's flight
The police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver's flight in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after he was hit by a car on the Murray-Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver continued without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday a 50-year-old man from Natalia came to the police in Shepparton.
It is expected to be accused of driving refuge and dismissing assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram stays in the hospital and is in a stable state.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy struck against rivals for claims to ring fighting
Melbourne-Storm-Trainer Craig Bellamy has described criticism of the tackling of his players as "Agenda-Setting" of two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Rooster Trainer Trent Robinson said that the arbitration judges allowed the "Ring Fights" of the Storm players with his team during the high storm victory in the Qualifying Finals in Sydney on Friday evening.
Brisbane Broncos Trainer Wayne Bennett made a hardly confined note to the Storm team after his team had won the final victory against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday evening. He called the game a "Muster Example" of the Rugby League and said that the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the rings.
Bellamy defended the Tac climb of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their "contact" during the tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches at his team was confident that it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"Trent Robinson talked about ring fighting when they hit us 24:2," said Bellamy on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques all year round, but in the last six weeks, we have made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and this has brought us the turn of the trend.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train. So he is probably not used to lose, so it was a little shock for him.
It's funny how this appears again and again at this season.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of the "spanning football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "language" football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was," said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he was going to take care of it.
But now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
That's the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants all to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like these.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they're a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us when it was about the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roosters achieved a higher result than the Broncos game against Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are making breaks and not dots of fun?
For me, it's the game plans.
When they mention us, it means that we will meet them in a phase.
The Storm team has the right to receive North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks on the next Saturday evening in the AAMI Park. Ticket sale begins from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 deposit after drug announcement
A man who might be threatening life-long punishment because of his attempt to possess 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland was released against a deposit of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the solay yacht, which came from South America over Vanuatu and settled in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed when he met his fellow defendants in the hunting harbor during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly life-sufficiency penalty for attempting to have a commercial amount of cocaine, the lawyer of Maksinovic argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole quantity and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has clear relationships with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he explained to the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a security deposit of $200,000 together in order to reach his release.
"After reading the equatorial statements of the two persons, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden," said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released against bail, under the conditions that he leaves his Australian and his Serbian passport, reports to the police daily, and keeps itself at an original block of 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 at Karlsruhe: Leaderhouse breaks apart

The leadership of the accident causer was completely dissolved.
The driver was seriously injured into a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely locked over six hours to two o'clock.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used phone of girls to lure pedophile to send pictures
A pedophiler used the phone of an 11 - year - old girl to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone when this slept, logging into an online messaging service, from which he received a number of inappropriate images from children sent to him by another user.
The girl wake up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages and immediately alarmed her mother.
The police took care of it and saw the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used words to search for inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he had done it because it would lead to "pedophile on the Internet" and then "he pretended to be a policeman to scare them."
The prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he was obliged to scare people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but he said that it had happened because he wanted to be a policeman to scare pedophile.
He was asked after his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was trembling and crying.
She also saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and faced the defendant.
The girl was interviewed and said that the accused computer and playstation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, declared guilty in the sense of the complaint to have taken up inappropriate images of children last 14 June, to have violated the obligations on 25 January of this year and not to have appeared before the court for a hearing on 24 March of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked that Hogg should not appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael moved the judgment until October to obtain background reports on social work.
Hogg was awarded a deposit in this case, but was held liable for hearings on other outstanding cases.
He was incorporated into the register of sexual offenders before the date of the judgment.
Schleusers deviate on small crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are caught apart from the major control points on the German-Austria border.
Many lockers made people increased at smaller crossings from fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, said a spokesman of the Federal Police.
Along the border flow of Inn, more than 1000 refugees have been attacked in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They were on foot across bridges and stairweds to the German side.
They are received and forwarded to registration by federal policemen.
According to Bundespolizei-Angaben, in comparison to the beginning of the week on Wednesday, there were considerably more refugees at the Munich Hauptbahnhof.
At 8:00 a.m., about 700 people had arrived in the state capital alone, said one speaker in the morning.
After the re-establishment of controls on the German-Austria border, refugees had reached the city on Tuesday 1759.
Stuttgart: Exhibitor of Tropensturm "Henry" in the southwest expected
Meteorologists warn against storm bows in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon.
Because of a low pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) informed in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the runner of the tropical tower "Henry", which has been pulled over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in recent days.
Hot storms and thunderstorms are mainly expected in Baden.
According to DWD, it is also expected to be in the Black Forest until Thursday early, on the Schwäbische Alb and in the Floor Sea district with bows from 60 to 90 kilometres of hours.
On Friday, the sun can be looked longer.
The mass makes it: Every two years, the car manufacturers on the IAA show their news.
In 2015, it is particularly important to show movement in the compact cars, which are currently particularly well selling.
Cars from the compact class are currently particularly demanded: Around 28.1 percent of the new permits were based on the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA) in August alone on this segment.
This is also reflected on IAA (Public Days 17 to 27 September).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new top-class and luxury cars this year, many new compact models are presented.
One of the largest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will stand with the dealers in autumn.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," said Opel-Chef Karl-Thomas Neumann at the fair.
He's the core of the brand.
In order to sell the volume model well, the new Astra should not become much more expensive for this.
Opel offers an ascent below the largest competitor VW Golf, which starts at 17 650 Euros.
The current Astra costs from EUR 16 990.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4 litre engine with 74 kW/100 PS.
In addition, the Hessen offer further diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 PS to 147 kW//200 PS, which include three-cylinder petroles for the first time.
Unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only a five-door opel.
As a second variant, the Combi will follow in spring, which can also be seen on the IAA.
And what next to the Astra on the IAA will happen to new compact cars?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and emphasized sporty GT version.
He's coming to trade at the beginning of next year, then also as a combi.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is completely new in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan delegator wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment.
The compact Infiniti fits fully into the design line of the brand with its curved lines.
The base model will receive a petrol engine with at least 90 kW/122 PS power.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 PS or 125 kW/170 PS.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, who celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter torbo engine and a power of 82 kW/11 PS.
The maximum torque is 170 Newtonmeters (Nm) according to manufacturer specifications.
Sales start of the Baleno in Europe is in spring 2016.
DS 4: Not quite new, but around it is the compact class model DS 4, which can be seen on the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën-depositor primarily placed hand on the front part: here the cooler grill was re-signed and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen and first integrated Apple's CarPlay.
In addition, on the IAA in the compact class a number of revisions and new variants such as the refreshed Mercedes A class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin Tile: Five square meters of cell are invaluable
The Federal Constitutional Court has given a former court of the Tegel Court of Justice, which had been housed for months in a too small cell.
Due to the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are entitled to financial compensation if they are stored in small cells.
This has been decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the data subjects, even if they had been imprisoned in the narrow rooms only a few days (Act: 1 BvR 1127/14).
This made it a success for an ex-seater with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: He was housed in the Berlin-Tegel Judicial Exekution Centre between June and November 2009 in a single cell with a surface of about five square meters; the toilet was not spatially separated.
Afterwards, the man who, according to his lawyer, has now been relocated to a larger cell.
His arrest of office failed because of the unworthy conditions of detention against the country of Berlin.
However, the Constitutional Judges lifted up the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for reexamination there.
You see the man's dignity hurt.
Chamber Court of First Instance now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons from the period in question, only a few days of imprisonment are relevant for compensation, there was a compensation claim, it said.
Otherwise, it would be "to fear a suspicion of the legal protection of the personality".
The Chamber Court now has to clarify the amount of compensation.
The constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past.
So they only spoke to a prisoner in April because he was naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multi-occupation of a cell without a separate toilet is unworthy.
In addition, on Wednesday Karlsruhe confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, who certified an innocent accommodation to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009.
The then prosecutor was housed daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons have also been in the headlines in recent weeks because of lack of staff.
Therefore, prisoners are repeatedly included 23 hours, aggressiveness increases, even battering should have already come because of the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 jobs in bricks are not occupied because of childhood shortages, 19 are to fall away in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What's happening to Germany?
According to Vizekanzler Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take up a million refugees this year after forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
In view of the unusual challenge, German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination: "I say again and again: We can do this, and we can do that."
What comes to Germany gives the following overview.
According to different forecasts between 350000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) apartments are used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as it has been built (250000 apartments).
Dramatic is the lack of living room but especially in the case of affordable rental objects: Annually 60000 to 80000 social apartments fall out of the rental price commitment, and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees.
The Federal Minister for Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the promotion, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
Too little is this from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80 000 social housings should be created annually and the federal government should invest a funding of 6.4 billion a year.
Scientists and Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing.
The Institute for Labour and Vocational Research estimates that 55 percent of refugees in Germany may be employed in the long term.
However, the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education in the Bertelsmann Foundation.
For the integration of refugees, however, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-evidence of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Dränhardt.
According to Dränhardt, there has been a political turn in Germany: from the ban on the work of refugees on the recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on asylum applicants of up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence obligation to restrict asylum applicants to a place of residence.
In society, even because of lack of expertise, the majority of the views have been that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster.
A great hurdle for access to the labour market is lacking German knowledge.
There is no sufficient offer of general and vocational language courses yet.
Studies also show that jobs are most often provided by personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore according to Dränhardt the king's way to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the Kitas, estimated to 10 to 15 percent: "It is very important for the entrenched parents to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the benefits of the Kita, the administration handbooks distributed in different languages.
If the need for educators increased by the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity, for example by allowing more professional schools.
Students in the countries will be prepared for the lessons in welcoming classes without German knowledge.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German student work estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study.
In principle, no country of asylum seekers or patience patience the study - the only exception has so far been Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his attitude.
Student-willing refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
For refugees with a permit to stay or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Application Act if they start a study.
The latter do not receive Bafög because they do not fall under the circle of the baföged persons.
So far, patienced refugees must have lived in Germany for four years in order to be entitled to Bafög, from January 1, 2016, this span is shortened to 15 months.
This funding gap must be closed, however, demanding Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the German Students' Work.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, for many refugees are Muslims, and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The State should successfully grant Islam the same rights as they have the churches, and develop the existing State Church Law to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish a Islamic well-being association that cares professionally for the new arrivals.
Rights include obligations.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the State in many areas and to give him certain control options.
This includes the willingness to act heavily against religious fundamentalism.
On Thursday, the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed the concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to endure such conflicts in Germany "have immediately their right to live here, in Germany, lost," he said in the Bayrian radio.
He suggested that the basic law be translated into Arabic.
Integration will be much more than today a topic of society.
This will also require a change in the majority of society, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Since a short decade, Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law.
But it is very slow to learn, as the NSU-Mord series showed, in the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motif.
The same opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and the stakeholders of non-white Germans have long been demanding and what international agreements such as the Anti-Rassism Convention Germany commit, must be realized in the coming years if the country is to remain peaceful and use its new citizens' opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany was able to provide medical care for the refugees previously expected, says Doctor President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"In terms of man power and capacities, we do it," he said to the day mirror.
However, additional money must be flown into the system.
In order to avoid congestion, Montgomery demands that all attendants be handed out health cards at the time of registration.
The benefits provided could later be charged with the federal countries.
And in the long term it is highly questionable to eat off so many people with the limited performance catalogue that the asylum application law presupposes.
Otherwise, doctors are especially making language barriers.
So far, the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has demonstrated that migrants are informed worse about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, even in doctoral practices, tolerances must be taken, it asks.
However, many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with another diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are considerably more untreated disabilities, and young people are referring to HIV disclosure.
With the partially other pictures of disease, German doctors would be clear from their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasite attack or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize." And as for the doctor's lack, the refugees may even be in sight of lighting.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, some refugees were even doctors.
In order to practise, however, they would need to prove their qualifications and perhaps re-examinations.
At least half of the refugees coming in Germany are psychologically ill, according to estimates by the Federal Psychotherapeutic Chamber (BPtK): Most suffer from posttraumatic stress disorders or depression.
Especially vulnerable are refugee children, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the TU Munich shows that each fifth Syrian refugee child is traumatized in Germany.
Those who are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorders suffer from so-called flashbacks with breath, dizziness, heart racing and death anxieties.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe fearfulness and emotional deafness.
In order to prevent symptoms from being chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz explained.
To date, however, only four percent of the psychologically ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although psychologically sick asylum seekers in the social offices can apply for psychotherapy, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, most employers or doctors who have not been trained for psychiatric diseases would decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misestimation, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new stage "Leidenschaft" the Circus Probst relies on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to draw every age group into the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressures and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites to the manege on the brick to dream.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and Junior Phine.
"Leidenschaft" - under this motto is the current manecination.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the family Probst.
So the gift of enthusiasm is in the blood of the family.
"It is important for us to take people away from their everyday rod and take them into a completely different world for two hours," stresses the 27-year-old Juneorchine.
"Manegencocktail with World Town Flair", says Director Reinhard Probst.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from around the world.
Excellent at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with witch and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their crafts.
With the heroes of the stumbling films, it wants to take the Cuban duo loosely.
Easyness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves.
Their humorous art on the mast is to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
Apart from numerous salmons, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with a feeling of finger tips and jointness.
Balancing the one wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snakemen are fascinating and frightening at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics as little other and fascinated with their mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
"The animals belong to our family," stresses Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst.
Disadvantages in the attitude of circus animals are only too often the subject of various animal protection organisations.
Stephanie Probst also says: "If our animals are not good, we are not well."
About 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stringel unit.
The "four-being artists", as they are called lovingly, will be read from the eyes as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn't feel comfortable, it doesn't want to go into the manege.
So the supreme commandment: provide good for the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a zebrastute, the family Probst is proud.
The two animals have lived together eight years in a mountain and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid is not ready for the Manege, but it is the unique mascot of the Circus Prost.
So, for every visitor, there might be something to do.
"One is safe," says Stephanie Probst, "While we have five or 1,200 viewers, we always give our best and are with all our hearts."
From September 17 to 20, the Circus Probst invites his ideas daily at 17 and 20 a.m.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 and 16 o'clock.
Thursday is family day, for the presentation at 17 a.m. the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal view is open daily from 10 to 18 o'clock.
Zimbabwes Robert Mugabe speaks wrongly in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media.
Parliament's opening was also disturbed by the allegations of opposition Members that they had received anonymous threats to death and were warned against accompanying Mr Mugabe's speech with boy calls.
Last month they had poured him out and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The speaker of the movement for democratic change (Movement for Democratic Change - MDC) Innocent Gonese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned against disturbing Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message comes from a number that is not displayed, but it has the title 'Death'," he said journalists after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "anxious" about the dangers for politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company's services.
HP will later this year split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service business.
The expected job reduction leads to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, said HP in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard-Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, which is supposed to lead the unit after separation.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses that support companies in the transition to a new business style," said Whitman.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever before to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion annual turnover and "will be concentrated on the provision of unenriched, integrated technology solutions for companies," says the company.
It divides a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stanford University Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical plants and whose Palo Alto Garage called man "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has passed a massive restructuring to tackle the removal of traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The measure of HP, the world's second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US technology companies, is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance.
FC Arsenal Capitän Mikel Arteta says team colleagues must stand in front of the game against Dynamo Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wilshere
Wenger emphasized to Wilshere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in view of his history, his participation in the European Championship will be uncertain in the following summer.
The great shame of this current problem is that Wilshere had ended the last season seriously after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old vibration during the pre-season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten career," said Wenger.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a major matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not in connection with his ankles or with the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also recognized, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The study of Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenals 157 League games in the last five games.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight games since 2007/08, which have most injuries.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil circle, but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a suspicious period, a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win force," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to overcome this.
I hope his body is stabilizing, I'm confident he'll do it and he'll run through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts his Champions-League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger sets a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta should start.
Wenger can also begin with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need to give a small break," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to continue through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the largest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also unshaked after 41 games after the "unconquerable" campaign was launched in the last season.
The stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake, measured at the Judge scale 3.2.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the remote hope of leading the club to his first European pocal triumph with its management.
"This drive is immense," said Wenger.
It has never worked with Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand, I am long enough in business to be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the Comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men's friendships
The lack of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in view of how the need for men to open itself has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM - campaign against a miserable life) announced 2015 as the man's year, with the aim of questioning culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is the heartpiece in the struggle to cope with this challenge.
A current study with more than 2,000 high-school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with "silent mood", his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of spiritually healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends to make a friendship work.
In the era of social media communication, with its focus on style about substance, the inevitability of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, life-sustainable and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, everything at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship, which affects our spiritual health much deeper.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can't really buy luck.
The nice thing with Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Every character was defined not by his work, but by his personality, which shined by the interaction as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandlers often embraced, moments during football gambling in cozy armchairs, and the longing from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case, even if they often retain to explore their feelings completely.
As one staff member of the telephone care told me, "my listener role for people who feel depressed and are suicidely threatened has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old expression "I am going to do so" has an enormous effect, such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems open."
Friends is one of the shows that come to mind when I try to offer more long-term management mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men's friendships.
So much my objective external status via the phone can also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so if you visit this weekend Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned scenery for the celebration of the day, why not take your friends to a drink in Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends are sent to Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PSG pass by Malmö.
Here are the game report and the response to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani took a course when Paris Saint-Germain started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö in the Princess Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player who brought the French master on the way, but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their advance when Cavani reached a headball gate in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master, as they seek not only the qualification for the K.O. rounds, but a improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class game by Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed chances in front of the gate. He was later exchanged in the game against his home town team and against the club with which he started his illustrative career already in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League. That's why it's a good start to win 2:0, cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still need to perfect during the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven't achieved one or two more gates."
Ibrahimovic returned in one of three changes to the Paris team after his injuries, which was able to hold a 2:2 independently on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was expelled in the fourth minute by Di Maria.
The Argentine wing storm was called the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he suggested why, when he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before passing along Johan Wiland nicely into the long corner of the network.
But if someone believed that PSG would achieve a great victory, he was disappointed.
Malmö, who hit Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deeply in the middle field.
But besides a shot by Nicola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin Trapp's pockets in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG himself sometimes gave up, with some mistakes and bad conclusions, not least of Ibrahimovic, who, at no less than five trials alone, was paced in the first half and then abandoned after Cavani had rebooted him.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, which Di Maria turned into a shoot, which was guided by Wiland in the 52th minute at the pace ...
The second gate finally fell shortly after the hour brand thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayian achieved its sixth season gate after Ibrahimovic had caught up a left flank from Maxwell.
This ended all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from shortest distance to stop David Luiz, could keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was recognized a gate at the end.
The trainer of Malmö, Age Hareide, later admitted that PSG played a class over his team, and the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish League that does not have the same level.
The qualification games are not enough."
Take a hat from Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore collects $2.5 billion through stock sales
The Glencore mining giant in Switzerland, which is affected by a collapsing raw material prices, collected $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its huge debt cutting plan.
The company Glencore registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay its own debts.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, fights with falling raw material prices, as China's economic deterioration pressures demand and devastating effects on markets.

The share jumped by 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore had announced the $2.5 billion sale last week as part of the more comprehensive plans to cut about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares of 125 Pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percentage discount on the final course on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares of up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns regarding long-term impeded growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other raw materials prices have decreased by 20 to 40 percent.

The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a visit to the US at the end of the month, confirmed the White House in a declaration on Tuesday.
The visit, Xis first official in Washington, takes place on September 25 and replied to President Barack Obama's trip to Beijing last November, said the statement.

"President Xis will offer an opportunity to extend American-Chinese cooperation in a number of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but at the same time President Obama and President Xi will also give the opportunity to address areas of disagreement constructively," the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders on his way to Washington before he goes to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial questions, including Washington’s concerns regarding supposed cyberspionage of China and its increasing self-consciousness in the controversial waters of the South Chinese Sea.

The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented change to FC Bayern in 2008
World and Europe Champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
The FC Bayern was obviously shortly before the commitment of Spain's Superstar Xavi, who played for the FC Barcelona at that time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times pocal victors, four times champion-league winner, two times club world champion, two times Europe champion, once world champion - the title list of Xavi is stunning.
In summer, the now 35-year-old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to the al-Sadd Sport Club to Qatar.
But in an interview with the Marca, Xavi now tells him that he was before the EM in 2008 before the departure from Barcelona.
"You told me that Barça wanted to sell me."
"Madrid won everything at the time, we didn't," he says.
And that's what the FC Bavaria registered.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bavaria."
"Romigge wanted me."
To remember: In summer 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over the FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi did not change
But the change was not done.
And the decisive man today works for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça took Guardiola under contract and I played a great EM."
"Pep told me I wouldn't change that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's what he got me."
Who knows how Bayern's play time had run with Xavi in 2008/2009.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter final of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn, turned the reds out (4:0, 1:1) and celebrated the king's class triumph at the end.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in film creation
Matt Damon faced Afro American filmmaker Efie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes.
During a episode of Sunday Night by HBOs Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the selected script of the project.
"When we talk about diversity, then do it when the movie is occupied and not when the show is occupied," Damon assures.
Brown reacted shocked, with offensive disbelief and called "Hoo! Wow. Okay", when the comments of the actor of The Martian were firmed.
Damon and Brown joined producer colleagues Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finists.
"I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony," said Brown first.
The only black person, and it's a cave that's beaten by her white container.
The producer of Dear White People set up for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the directorial rights on the film; Damon replied that her director "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, the social media exploded before misapproving Damon's comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger about the clip by writing "Matt Damon speaks about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WEISS that it hurts".
The Tweet earned more than 5,000 Retweets and 4,000 Likes since his release.
Damon's comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the top of the social debate.
After the teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved effect throughout the country and urged legislators and authorities to stop discriminating practices against colourful abstention.
In February, the singer Prince made a remark on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter" (Alphas still have their significance) he said.
Like books and black life, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group," the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media mogules that were invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already taken the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Profis climbers and operating aid Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete that won the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening and took the Great Price of $1 million home.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle track.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and Kameramann Geoff Britten, managed to the finale.
The last task was to climb on a 75-foot-long climb in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within the time, with which he was the first athlete to complete the struggling phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge fullly three seconds faster, making him a victor.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard victory, still under the shock about the gain of the Great Prize of $1 million.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about it, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," said Isaac E! about his lot of money.
So suddenly .. as I can't even imagine how this is... the future is unknown.
The leading producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten, although the first one ended the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," said Weed.
How much money is a wonderful price and life is changed, he gets the great congratulations.
I don't think he's having any wrath about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received masses of awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be struck by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles.
America Ninja Warrior was extended for an eighth season, the turning work will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers Swallow to Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Earlier they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the tigers are on the last place in the American League Central.
The tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but this part played perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in the Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins spoiled a chance to get up in a play half of Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard place.
For Detroit, if only for one evening, it was a return of the three letter F-word that was so difficult to capture over a large part of the second half of the season.
"All victories are fun no matter how," said Tiger's Manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger-Pitcher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) shot six times in the 1/3 Innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine parties.
"I want to end strongly this year," said Simon.
It's hard to throw every game in the cop, so I want to go into the game completely concentrated.
The designated Tiger Hit Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid August.
It was the first three-hit game of Martinez since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the wood well," said Ausmus.
He looked good at the (stamp training), looked much better in the cop, and he put it directly into the game.
With three runs in the retreat at the end of the seventh Innings, the Twins had their best chance to come back to play.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the Inning with a double on the left line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a color, and Simon brought his second Baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before he was replaced by the left hand Blaine Hardy.
Hardy survived wall, the only man with whom he was confronted, before the designated Rookie-Chatman Miguel Sano, who the right hand Drew Verhagen entrissed a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run at the second, Verhagen brought the third Baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading in the Major League 27 times this season that Plouffe beat a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, the wall created a double of RBI against the closer of the tigers Bruce Rondon and achieved the stand of 5-4.
However, the right-handed hand cut out Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a Phil Hughes, which was not yet moving.
The tigers achieved three runs in the first two innings against the right-hand veteran, which had been deleted by the injured list before the game, after he had missed more than a month because of a back suffering.
"Of course I didn't want the beginning I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt better than I left and felt that I would create some pretty good pitches there in the third Inning."
After receiving the leadoff batter, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game that created a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez created his 0-21 success series with the runners in the Scoring position.
The third Baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, created another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third, which ended the threat.
The tigers occupied a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single from the center-field Anthony Gose at 3-0.
"This was a big blow," said Twins-Manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he caught the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch coin, did not achieve any points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reliever A.J.Achter.
At Hughes there were three runs at six hits and a walk with four strike outs.
OPINION: Tiger's RHP Anibal Sanchez expelled because of an injuries of the sculptor.
He was studied by Dr. James Andrews, who operated the shoulders of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, since mid-August on the injured list because of a shoulder distortion, is to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez from the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris with 1-1 at four starts with the tigers since he was purchased in exchange with LHP David Price on 30 July
He missed since August 20th because of a decay in the right hip joint.
The tigers and the twins will finish their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2.4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota's RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees are supposed to enter Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to Hessen.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people therein should then be housed in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden reported on Tuesday evening.
She expected 450 to 750 incoming refugees.
Several sports halls of the Czech capital have been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the government presidium responsible for initial inclusion, Gießen had arrived 7500 people in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also established emergency accommodations in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria a possibility.
"I think the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He threw "collective waywards" to the European states.
Four years ago, one was glad that the Kelch had passed a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict is cracking in front of our door," he said in Germany's radio.
The former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase of international aid on-site for refugees.
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
According to Germany, Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner declared in the Austrian TV broadcaster ORF on Tuesday evening, no one will be sent back to Hungary.
Germany also did not send any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's so agreed," she said.
On the question of an agreement that Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria a day, Mikl-Leitner said that there had already been discussions in this regard between the Director-General for Public Security and Representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and pointed to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria through the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their goal is mostly Germany.
The Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann requested a special summit for next week, together with several other Heads of State and Government.
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have so far not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
At a special meeting on Tuesday, 22 September, EU Ministers would like to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees.
In view of the strong refugee squad in Germany, the bundle wants to strengthen the support of the countries in the first stage and distribution of people.
The Confederation would manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of discussions with the Prime Ministers at the Kanzleramt in Berlin.
Merkel underlined, those people who need protection also commence it.
But whoever has no perspective could not stay in Germany.
This view had been impressively divided in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the State as a whole had to cope with a "great effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometers long border to Serbia on the night.
A few hours later, the government announced in Budapest to lock the border to Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country belongs to the EU differently from Serbia.
Hungary wanted to prevent Schlepper from looking for fallback routes across Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said to the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey there were thousands of other migrants on the way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness reports.
Space probe "Cassini" finds ocean on Saturnmond Enceladus
Under the ice crew of Saturnmond Enceladus, a global ocean swept.
This closes researchers from observations of the space probe "Cassini".
Accordingly, the moon leans slightly on its path around the ring planet.
Although this muzzle movement is only small, yet too large for a continuously solid celestial body, it is said in a communication from the Cornell University in Ithaca (US State New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
For a long time it was known that under the ice ceiling of Enceladus there must be liquid water.
Thus, "Cassini" had already discovered ice volcanoes on the south pole of the Saturnmond, spying water vapor and ice particles, feeding the so-called E-Ring of the Saturn.
At least on the South Pole there had to be an underground sea, the astronomers then closed.
However, the expansion of the hidden ocean was not cleared.
Rama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must refrain from open-scienteur Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation caused an adductor injury to the 27-year-old, the association informed.
Rama had complained about pain at the beginning of the week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "probably four weeks of forced break".
"That's hard for us, Rama is a hearty loss."
"Of course we have to think now," said sports director Necat Aygün of the "Image" newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a unifying professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian has at present "the opportunity to prove his ability".
Torjäger Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his brain shock.
On Thursday, the Austrian national player is to enter the course training.
Okotie had injured in the party at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a severe collapse on the head.
However, against first fears, he remained without a serious Blessur.
No diet-fruit - Mangos contain lots of sugar
Mangos are exotic and sweet.
But whoever wants to pay attention to his slim line is often more disturbed by them.
Because Mangos contain relatively much sugar - especially sucrose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: In them are B vitamins and the vitamins E and C. In particular, mangos contain a lot of vitamin A and its predecessor beta carotin.
Those who eat the fruit thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, Mangos should not be too soft or too fast and smell pleasantly.
The shell color alone says nothing about how mature the fruit is - so also green mangos can taste very delicious.
You should store at room temperature and be eaten within a few days.
Of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
A mango also gives heartfelt dishes a special note.
It mildens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well to fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
U.S. package service UPS reimburses up to 95000 aids for Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, informed UPS on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are searched.
Last year, UPS had increased its staff for the holiday season by 95000 aids.
In view of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have made arrangements for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, delayed deliveries had brought strong criticism to parcel services.
First Föhnsturm, then Marking Kaltfront
The next night in the valleys of the Alpennord side of the fountain breaks through, as Meteoschwitz reported on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday, the hairdresser is partly blowing through the fountain valleys with stormy strength.
After the dawn on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, which brings strong rainfall, windbows and a temperature drop.
According to MeteoNews, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low pressure area over the British islands in a strong southwest current.
On the Alpennord side, the night to Wednesday the hairdresser breaks through the valleys.
As a result, until Thursday morning, the hairdresser blasts in the fountain valleys with floors from 60 to 100 km/h, separated and partly also in Urnerland with over 100 km/h.
The fountain can penetrate to the neighbouring medieval country, and the mountains are even hurricane floors of more than 120 km/h.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hairdresser provides summer temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the alpine slope begins to stamina.
Here's rain that lasts until Thursday evening.
In sum, south of the Alps must be counted in the next 48 hours with partially more than 100 litres of rain per square metre, which has already fallen large rain in the last days.
On Thursday morning, the hairdresser leaves the air, as a result, a cold front rolls over Switzerland with strong, partially whistled rain from West to East.
Together with the cold front, the wind is rising strongly to stormy, and the temperatures are falling considerably.
The following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it becomes sunny on the weekend and warmer with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther platform
Near 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin-Luther platform in Rome.
In the presence of President Ignazio Marino, a so far nameless place in the park was baptized on the oppio hill on the name of the German Reformator.
At Piazza Martin Lutero, he is now honoured as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the working community of the evangelical churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical-Lutherian community in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes over centuries could often live as a minority only in the hidden.
With the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith was welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustine monk in Rome at the turn of the year 1510/11.
He then felt the city as a perishable babe of sin.
His negative impressions should have strengthened him, according to historians, in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the evening-land church with his tesses against the decree trade.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
At the beginning, was the word?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt-Bibel, which has now appeared with magnificent pictures.
At the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs formulated his entire personal interpretations of Bible stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has received the 75-year-old - which is by no means equal to "lusty" images.
On the contrary, adapting to the respective topics can be quite dark.
About three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many topics of the "book of all books".
Established are cycles dedicated to such topics as crossroads, plagues, commandments or ours.
With this he spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther publishing with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing with its focus on art books.
And there is especially the author Klaus Altepost, who has been dealing with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting.
He interpreted the Bible posts selected by Otmar Alt and so in today, in current contexts "translated".
These texts are like verbal mirrors of old painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each one of the artists who formulate his entire personal thoughts about the situation.
The jewelry tape has golden letters.
The 75-year-old thus doubles a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lordhuter orders.
"Then the education has already happened with the pipestock," Otmar Alt recalls.
"I have tried to work this out, perhaps to bear myself again with the Lord's Father."
His second concern is to restore art to more importance in fast-lived times: "The perception of image worlds is today characterized by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolic is pushed out there.
Artists have a different desire and delight to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect, I am a dinosaur."
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "invade" the images, let them work on themselves, discover and feel the strength they have: "The image is looking for its opposite."
Klaus Altepost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt Foundation, "always" to be a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his images".
Old did not pay attention to the complete understanding of the Bible but to select the important, also mysterious topics for him.
"That wasn't a cooperation at the height of the eye," says Altepost: "This is about the images, the text merely explains".
For Hans Möhler of the Luther publisher, this work is an invitation to " deepen his life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt's images speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love as well as those of responsibility.
A part of the originals - paper and canvas images - is presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX rail
Plans made, found space, commissioned companies, modeled ground hills for a round course: A year later almost everything was done - yet before the official opening of the BMX track it was already finished.
Failures in politics and administration provided for Verdruss, especially with the residents who did not want to to tolerate the railway.
So dropped hills, searched for new space - now with formal planning and application for construction permit.
In October, the approval would be granted, the first municipal councilman Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now be informed by the Children's and Youth Committee.
"I hope that this year is still visible," she said.
It should then be started without a "wider memorial break" with the work at the former indoor pool.
DFB intensifies commitment for refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sets a clear sign on the weekend.
The football reacts to the emerging situation in Germany and ensures political assistance in addressing the upcoming problems.
"I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the reunification."
"In principle, nobody can say that doesn't matter to me, I have nothing to do with it."
"This has to be an interest for each individual to handle this issue," said DFB-Chef Wolfgang Niersbach.
During his annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I am next Wednesday at the Office of Chancellor and meet the Minister of State, Ms. Özoğuz and the Chancellor."
"Then the topic will certainly play a central role," he announced.
The football can and want to help.
But the decisive course must be political.
The German Football Confederation has therefore expanded its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"With the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019," said Niersbach at the edge of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian's/Malta.
Some Bundesligisten also support this programme.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals put a clear sign when they will wear the impression "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left tricot bear instead of the usual sponsor's logo (Hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only," said Leverkusens Sports Chief Rudi Völler of the "Image" newspaper (Service Day) and called the project "of course".
"The Refugee Drama is on everybody, no one is allowed to see away."
"We can, no, use our radiation, influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly," said Hertha-Manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim's Managing Director Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the League".
The national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the EM-Qualification Game against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach referred to the support of refugees as "a major community of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations in their places started their own projects is great.
It is just as great that small and smallest associations are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome", which we have issued, will be lived in the football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
In this and next year, the Association, together with the DFB selection and the Federal Government, provides EUR 300 000 for the integration of refugees.
"The associations have already picked up the total sum for 2015," said Niersbach.
Reports: SAP Board Head loses an eye in case of accident
According to several reports, the Chairman of Europe's largest software group, Bill McDermott, lost the left eye by a fall in early July.
During the accident on the staircase in his brother's house in the United States, he fell after midnight on a water glass that he had worn in his left hand, the "economic week" reported on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeded, was faint, then pulled out to the street - that's what he told us last week," quoted the "WiWo" SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott could follow his work.
"In the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager is at the meeting and "completely capable of working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Dondertagsausgabe) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full of SAP, full of my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," said McDermott of the "SZ".
McDermott usually pends between Germany and the USA, but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP center in Walldorf.
He is important to go to the public with such a personal story, said the manager of the "SZ": "Everything can happen."
"It's important to get up again when you've fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnus except fighting ...
Magnussen twittered a corresponding photo and explained that he had suffered the injury when he was crashed by the wheel.
It is therefore as little as reserve drivers for the two tribal pilots Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, when retiring in Singapore on the weekend, as a week later at the Great Price of Japan.
Football: BVB without giant against Krasnodar: pasture fields in the gate
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League.
The national player will also miss the table leader of the FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00/Sky).
"I'm sorry we can't fall back on him," said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect to return from him to his training on Friday."
Given the high load of his professional, Tuchel will not only change his tribal on the reus position.
So he announced a change to the gatekeeper position.
Roman Weidenfeller therefore takes the place of Roman Bürki.
"He trains on an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether pasture fields are used in the future in all Europe-League games, however, Tuchel left open.
With a high probability, he will also challenge the second party.
The research statement by fellow player Reus that the final entry for the BVB in the Europa League must be the target, considers middle field player Julian Weigl to be perceptible: "This is not Marco that is not so wrong."
"I think we have a good chance to grab the title."
Roboterautos: Government wants to lead for Germany
Germany is supposed to be, according to the will of the Federal Government, in changing the car's technological leadership.
On Wednesday, the Bundeskabinett decided a strategy paper from the House of Ministers of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which includes investments in the development of digital infrastructure.
On Wednesday in Frankfurt, on the edge of the IAA, Dobrindt spoke of a "new mobility era".
The automated and networked drives will increase traffic safety and ensure less disturbances, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the subject with his official colleagues from the G7 countries, who also meet with representatives of industry at the IAA.
The Strategy Paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid turnover to digital radio.
In order to test new technology, a test track is currently being established on the highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order to "have no additional liability risks to the driver," the Federal Government wants to "check the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to use internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for automobile cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The Federal Government also seeks to make a change to the Vienna Convention, which is only a driver to date.
During automated driving, the car is increasingly taking over the lead, the driver becomes more and more a passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that collect the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, high-automatised motorway driving will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are "expected first far after 2020".
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the location of Germany estimate the authors of the study for 2025 at around 8.4 billion euros.
"The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road transport," said SPD traffic policymaker Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability for accidents and the safety of the personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
The German automobiles, however, still see skeptical - much more than French or Americans.
A survey submitted on Wednesday at the AA by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the Dekra Audit Organisation is the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will continue in the next ten years, 32 percent expect only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect 33 percent of autonomous cars in the United States until 2025.
Nevertheless, the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
After a survey by the Bitkom Digital Association, only seven percent would agree to carry out the control during the entire journey on all roads.
On the motorway, the flowing traffic could represent 15 percent, 45 percent in the stew.
Good one fourth would not leave control to the car under any circumstances.
Boll says team and double start at Tischtennis-EM
The Düsseldorfer only wants to strike in detail after the current stand at the title fights from 25 September to 4 October.
The final decision shall be taken at the latest on 22 September.
"That's a huge loss for our team."
"The boys learned it in the morning."
"We are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roskopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
At that time Boll was on the flight to a long-term sponsorship date in China.
The 34-year-old German master will be expected back on Friday.
"Ohne Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favorite," said Single Europe champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the set list in Jekaterinburg, also reminded the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
"Timo also missed that time, and we became Europe champion."
"We should focus on that," said the world rankings fives.
The English football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United has attracted a serious injury on the right leg.
At the Champions-League game at the PSV Eindhoven, the defendant was hit at a Tackling of Héctor Moreno and exchanged after long treatment.
The first diagnosis suggested that the 20-year-old partner of Bastian Schweinsteiger was a sign-in-break.
Gaultier feels too old for an enfant terrible
It is a blend of very large fashion show and a wax figure glass cabinet: The designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich about his work.
The highlights: window dolls that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became Madonna's stage outfits the great star of the fashion scene - and so he put men in robes.
"I can't say today I'm the enfant terrible of the skin Couture because I have white hair."
"In the past it was bleached, now it's real," said Gaultier.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From Citizensteig to the Walk), which can be seen from September 18 at the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Cultur Foundation, it is a happiness that the fashion creator has changed his initial disgusting attitude to a show about his person.
Actually, he was against it, for: "For me an exhibition sounded a little after death," he said.
When you die, you come to the museum.
The impressive collection had already been in the Canadian Montreal and Paris Station.
"It's so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly surprising work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not built, but it is an excellent choreographed overall artwork for which much effort has been made: to freshen the dolls, for example, a stylist was dedicated.
14 tons of material, according to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers drove to Munich.
Shortly before the beginning of the October festival, there was a special shmankerl: a leather pants outfit with corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He was always interested in strong women ("women are smarter than men") and for people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier's old Teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
He stands for the first, harsh fashional walks of the designer.
As a child (he wasn't a good pupil and bad in football) he dressed his Teddy BHs and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have allowed him.
He later taught himself to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
Later, I bought it, of course.
For his first own fashion show, he couldn't pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of Gardine - Plauener Spitze als Mode-Nische
Earlier it went into the long embroidery machines and to plauen to make meters.
The embroidered substances and tips were produced in a large amount for customers, for example they processed to covers and curtains.
This alone is no longer working today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early times of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a larger role, was then penetrated by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt lists some examples: top in jewellery, accessories such as pockets and regional pursuits.
Overall, the so-called vintage fashion, which relies on past style periods, constitutes an increasing order potential.
Anyone who does not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, together with nine other companies, is a member of the industry association Plauener Spitzen und Stickereien.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have been broken.
Private and wholesale businesses are almost no longer available.
Our products are hardly reaching customers in this way.
Today, the mass goods are made much cheaper in Asian space and almost exclusively distributed through chains.
In addition, exports are weakened, currently in Russia and the USA.
Sufficient reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to do with environmental consciousness, as Cordula Bauer of the Stickperle in Falkstein explains: "Since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we are producing ecologically and socially tolerant."
Reinhardt added: "This also refers to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snowberger outside of the Zwickau University - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroidery and tips.
To counteract the competition from Asian space, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a voltage field between the most fresh ideas of the designers and the businesses that need to think economically," says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to hold a customer strain.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine sticks small balls in some places.
The Plauener Goldschmiedemeister Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before I couldn't start anything with traditional plauener Spitze."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate procedure, it embraces the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuter.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surroundings and who want a memorial.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauener Spitze.
Disney plants new "Mary Poppins" movie
Legends shouldn't be touched, but Disney still dares a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
However, according to "Entertainment Weekly" it is not about a refilming but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical girl.
It is about the experience of Nanny with the Banks family in times of the world economic crisis in England.
He who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy more widely for the world
The economy has to open its way outside in order to promote growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday a group commissioned to control the reform.
"China should try to attract foreign investments and know-how and improve business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform.
Promoting new foundations and promoting reforms will bring about new vigor and vitality and will provide new space for economic growth, said Xi.
The management group has adopted a number of directives, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxation of border control policy, promotion of state firms (SOE), incorporation of private capital, and restoration of the resident's communication system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created identifying sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by test programs.
The initiative is important because it has a greater role to play in the allocation of resources, ensures a legal-governmental business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls on the powers conferred on companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
Other areas of private investment will be opened as part of a offer to open publicly controlled sectors.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services for them," said the statement.
In addition, it is easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimising the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee their activities and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
Premier Li Keqiang and important leaders like Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also participated in the meeting, as reported in a declaration published after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in robbery
The European Commission wants to double the limits for mercury in large robbery fish and thus add a significantly higher dose of nervous poison to consumers.
The Foodwatch consumer organisation, which has a EU working paper, criticized the plans sharply: "Risics and adverse reactions of defective industrial and environmental policies will be forwarded with full weight to pregnant and small children," said Matthias Wolfschmidt by Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nervous toxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shark or sword fish for "economic policy" are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish.
However, large predators have already been so severely burdened with mercury that, on the basis of the still applicable limits, about 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold.
After doubleing the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unrecoverable.
According to Foodwatch, the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from 0,5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
But Foodwatch called this "trick", because smaller Friedfish, such as carp, are usually so low that they already meet the planned maximums today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfumed deduction manoeuvre that helps the economy alone," explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans, which is highly enriched by the food chain, especially in predators.
Therefore, the Federal Government warns that "prepared small quantities can cause particularly in the case of inborn damages of the nervous system".
The Federal Ministry of the Environment, however, explains at its homepage with regard to the applicable limits that a "health threat to the general population" cannot be expected.
Mercury mainly comes into the environment through the burning of coal.
According to a written information by the Federal Ministry of the Environment, the German coal power plants are exposed to Annalena Baerbock, a member of the Green Federal Government, more than six tons of mercury per year, two thirds of the total volume emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was "permanent and surface-decked", quoted the "piece" from the paper in March.
Last year, European-wide warnings to mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the RASFF EU warning system.
