Biker responds quickly and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcycle driver was slightly injured due to its quick reaction.
Car driver overlooks bikers
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left on the Landesstraße in 1230 towards Machtolsheim, with her VW from Merklingen at 21.30 p.m.
She overlooked the 24-year-old, pre-authorized motor-addrivers coming from the direction of Nellingen.
At the collision, hand- and foot brake levers fly away
The biker was still trying to avoid the car, still stripping it at the back of the vehicle.
Due to the strike process, the hand- and foot brake levers were demolished at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Spiritually, he controlled his motorcycle in the green stiffs next to the motorway and had it rolled out there without falling.
Biker suffers bone injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury at the Bei and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona Mass infection: 174 harvest aiders infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in the Lower Bavarian Mamming, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave.
A security service monitors the excess ban.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positively on the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau informed on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we have to go this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the company - this was the occasion of the series test.
The plant is a large vegetable farm, the earthberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers only for legglasses.
Mamming is a rural community with well 3300 inhabitants located near Dingolfing with its large BMW work.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to maintain peace: "After our information, it is a closed circle of persons".
Infected persons were separated from uninfected employees at the courtyard, the site is now surrounded by a locker fence.
Greens and SPD gave co-responsibility to the government.
The two opposition fractions pretended Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet to neglect the control of the accommodation of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly avengeable if such local infections have to be triggered and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, parliamentary director of the Greens.
The SPD looks similar: "We have already requested a special control programme for farms with harvest workers after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May," said environmental expert Florian von Brun.
"According to the hygiene conditions at the workplace and to the living conditions, we consider it necessary to be closely monitored.
This has obviously not happened."
The outbreak had come "with announcement".
Aidenbachstraße Metro Station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls to the track bed after pusher

Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of stock data
The stock data storage is currently suspended.
However, Federal Minister Horst Seehofer demands an extension of the storage period following a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended stock data storage after a media report - instead of the planned ten weeks a half a year.
As the "Picture on Sunday" reports, Lakehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a rapid change of law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He believes it is useful to "make urgently necessary adjustments in the law already now," quotes the letter newspaper.
Currently, stock data storage is suspended.
It is expected to make a decision by the ECJ.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, says the report.
A spokesman of the Ministry of Justice said that it could only be examined usefully if legal adjustments were required if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer and the interior ministers of the countries had already agreed to store stock data in June.
NBA: Stripclub fighters for Clippers-Star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball professional of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament in Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a burial.
According to US media reports, he visited the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is supposed to have admitted to the visit according to ESPN specifications, is back in Isloation, is tested daily on Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these Wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another Stripclub in Atlanta, Anm. d. R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA-Insider Shams Charania announced on Sunday at Twitter that the NBA Williams had ordered a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers Star thus misses the first two official parties after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finals starting on Friday at night.
Söder is expressed after mass infection to the corona layer
Munich - Minister for Health Melanie Huml (CSU) announced a petroleum for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has shocked authorities and policies.
At the large vegetable farm, nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries are currently working, over a third have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is locked off with a building fence.
No one can leave the site, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the well 3300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt has so far assumed that the infections have not spread beyond the court.
"Knowledge bites": confession of the suspected firestifter of Nantes
"My client has shown himself cooperatively," said the lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the deeds very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was " plagued by conscience bits and taken very much from the extent of destruction".
In case of a condemnation, the man, according to the prosecutor, is threatening ten years of imprisonment and a fine of EUR 150,000.
The Gothic Sankt-Peter-and-Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged at a fire during the night on Saturday last week.
The fire was broken out in three far-reached places in the church.
Laboratory tests hardened the suspicion of burning.
The now imprisoned suspect had been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent penetration into the church, he quickly came into the view of the investigators.
Discussion about the abolition of the 50+1 rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel recommended to think about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"The German football should at least discuss, define conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts," said Grindel of the "Image on Sunday".
He emphasized: "For the associations that can become the most dangerous Bavaria and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, the debate is not about whether it is not required to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations who want to break into this Phalanx".
However, he doubts whether in the German football league there was the willingness to allow majority participations prohibited by the 50+1 rule in the Bundesliga.
"It remains a legal risk of attracting investment to the location of Bundesliga in a European internal market," Grindel said.
The former DFB Chief sees the risk that "the attempts to ensure more competition balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a equal distribution of the TV funds will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences are already enormous among the first three associations alone.
The other 15 associations have an average household of 130 million," said the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Leider there have been people who noticed this error and have pierced to the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said about the adoption of a expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That has been very busy for me."
He had received the gift of about 11,000 euros from an Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw out the consequences," said Grindel.
"With the ominous watch gift, I have been completely transparent and unhappy.
There were many in the DFB who knew about it.
He never made a "cream of the gift", assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naiv, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead
The protests against police force in the United States have renewed by Donald Trump's use of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday there was collapse between demonstrators and policemen in various cities.
In Louisville, three people were injured, 16 people arrested in Seattle.

The security forces, including officials of the Federal Police, used tear gas on Saturday and forced demonstrators to disperse violently.
Hundreds, partly armed demonstrators marched by Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday and demanded that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be taken into responsibility.
The 26-year-old student was shot at a drug razzia in her apartment in Louisville in March.
The goal of the Razzia was someone else who didn't live there at all, and no drugs were found.
As a member of a group called himself a armed alliance of black Americans on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to the NBC transmitter, they were taken to the hospital.

In the end, there was no collapse of the two groups.
In the Texan Austin, a person was shot and died in the course of a Black Lives Matter demonstration.
The police, according to their own information, took a suspect into custody.
It has not yet made any further information on the circumstances of the act.
According to the New York Times, Mayor Steve Adler informed that he was, as many in the city, "unfortunately and ruthless" because of what had happened.
Also in the American metropolis Seattle, demonstrators collaborated with the police on Saturday.
They were in front of a youth prison building cars, the police put Blendgranates and pepper spray.

The fire could be removed quickly again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of people demonstrating on a highway.
As the police reported, one of the demonstrators fired a weapon and at least one person was injured to the hospital.
In addition, windows were slammed in a court and a fire was laid, as the police told.
Investigations have been taken.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes despite Corona
Although the large sauce in the Kurstadt was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was uncommon for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party miles in the city centre were missing, human masses and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy ball or festival, many came to their expense at the Corona-conforming alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy flair," says Kurdirektor Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, you will return to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as the Historians alone were in the focus of the festival.
Comfortable Atmosphere
Vesna Konhausen has been visiting the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for over 25 years.
This time in the Corona year.
The couple have made it comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watch the historians watching flaning and listening to Cuban live music at the playbank restaurant.
"I also like it so pleasant," says Konhaus.
She doesn't miss the masses of people that else belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you miss the usual program highlights, all of them in front of sales burns on Friday evening as well as the historical transhipment and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's awful.
The weather would have been great this year," she says.
Rakoczy rider should take place again
For the performers of the historical Kurasts, the alternative program meant partly more work.
Something for Christina Gold, which works in a normal year on the festival train and can be seen there on the cottage of the Kurgartencafes.
This year she was traveling in Costume on foot in the city on Saturday and Sunday.
"That's harder, otherwise we've got it easier," she says.
The rider club had less to do, even though individual riders were travelling in the park.
"We hope very much that the rider quadrille will be allowed to take place next year," says Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy rider should also take place again.
28 Corona cases with Spanish second-ligist Fuenlabrada
The Spanish football twinist CF Fuenlabrada slippes increasingly deep into the crisis because of a corona outbreak.
Since the newly fought from the vicinity of Madrid, despite the first Corona Falls on July 20, to a game to the city of A Coruña, a deep hit follows the next.
By Sunday 28 players or team members had been tested positively, one came to the hospital, as the club told.
Fuenlabrada from the same city southwest of Madrid had yet the opportunity to reach the rise playoffs.

The linen had also not been changed for five days.
Another problem is eating.
Neither was it good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, informed that it was satisfied with the hotel.
The accusation to have deliberately threatened public health, backed the lawyer of the club, Javier Tebas Llanas.
They did not violate the Corona rules set up by the Football Association, the son of the President of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as reported by the Europe Press News Agency and the Sports Magazine "Marca".
Before the departure, four infected persons had been infected until July 19th, but all were isolated and were not included.
Right before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, other team members of the Corona test were positive with "five or six".
The game was canceled 60 minutes before the launch, said Tebas Llanas.
Police must catch horses crushed at damp

When the officials arrived, the horses were again between the supplier and the village of Dampfach.
After the officials were able to gain the trust of the horses shortly before damp, they were able to change a rope carried in the strip car.
Radprofi Tony Martin: Career Continued
Temporary Specialist Tony Martin thinks about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - The seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just working out with the team how and in what form it could continue," said the 35-year-old of the "Frankfurter General Sunday newspaper".
Martin is currently employed at the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered to end his career after this year before the Corona break.
During the negotiations with his team, it is also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Just back to the wheel.
Today, I think as a father of a little daughter, what would be if".
The bike professional admitted that there are quite aspects with which it is increasingly difficult to do.
"But it was good for me to remember what I have in cycling and how much fun he makes me."
The time-driving specialist goes back to the competition campaign at the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August).

Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football trainer Niko Kovac, with his new Club AS Monaco, there is soon a resemblance with the influence of Frankfurt.
The eight-time French master hosts the Hessen, the former Croatian club, on August 1st (18.00 p.m.).
For the Bundesligist, it is the first and only tough test before the replay in the Europa League against the FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the corona virus pandemic, the encounter is carried out without spectators.
"We are especially looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," said Kovac.
This is an interesting test, said the 48-year-old.
Before he moved to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac trained the Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to the victory in the DFB pokal.
"A high-quality opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing again with Nico Kovac," said Eintracht-Trainer Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had taken up the succession of the Croatian.
In March the Frankfurters had lost the eightelfinal play against Basel in their own stadium at 0:3.

In the Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 Panzernashorns died by earthruth.
They are under protection and are deemed to be threatened by extinction.

Bangladesh is, according to the United Nations, one of the most affected countries.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 by the floods displaced persons.
Until now, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to bring people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm also takes place in Grenezn.
Those who had a house before, it was so small and like a hut, often do not want to spend their lives in a large block of living.
Many apartments are empty, but - so it wants the government - will soon be taken from those who have lost their house through the floods.

Argentina rejects the counter offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires informed on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unjust," said an opinion.
"With 50 percent of children living in poverty in Argentina, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under current conditions.
Therefore, Argentina calls on its private creditors to refrain from some of their demands of around $66 billion (about EUR 59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is threatening again.
It would be the ninth payment failure in the Argentine history.
Lastly, the creditors demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentinian government holds its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was last more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect to reduce economic power by about 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest claims of $503 million and was thus shrinked into a limited default of payments.
Employed - privately not yet
"It's running super good" - this conclusion attracts Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days in the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end everything went very fast: In mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that in the Eggenfelden Notariat's Notariat's site, she will follow Lutz fields.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctorate took up the work, the normal day business has long been running on full tours.
"I have to arrive, however", she explains in conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short advance period has not been enough to move the food point from Regensburg to Eggenfelden completely, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She and her husband, who is a judge at the Landgericht in Regensburg, are currently looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband had been able to request a short-term parental period to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to get out of Regensburg every day, she also has an opportunity to stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Grown up in the neighbourhood, the city of Eggenfelden is of course a term for a long time.
During local visits with her family in recent months, she recently observed: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
The more she was pleased that she had made the race in the selection process around the free place.
She also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional course in Niederbayern: After the Jura Study in Passau, she performed her referendariat time and the 2nd State Exams in Regensburg.
After several stations as a Notarassessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu, and Regensburg - at that time she also trained the promotion in labour law - she took her first place in 2012 as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau.
She went in her parental life in 2016 and finally moved to Regensburg.
Since then she took over representation services in various notariat bodies.
When the post had been written in Eggenfeld because of the close retirement of Lutz Fields, it had seen the right time for full recruitment, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the Notariat's office, has completely accepted Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a commendation for the team of the Office parat: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
In the case of children's garden respective cribs, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start with a maximum of 15,000 viewers
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled with 20 percent for the season start in case of a fan return.
"According to the distance control that is forced to comply, we plan to be present with 12.000 to 15,000 viewers," said Borussia Dortmund's Managing Director Carsten Cramer for the "Tagesspiegel".
Usually, the Arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 viewers at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic of the past season, the BVB per party had lost around four million euros.
The Cramer responsible for Marketing, Digitalisation and Internationalisation, who is responsible for the BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spots, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality area can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the account if these revenues are completely broken away."
In view of the persistent corona crisis, all are currently "advisable to take a stable side length first".
"If many companies are not well and 6,8 million people are in short work alone in Germany, then the need is limited to entertainment," Cramer said.
The Dortmunder Marketing Chief praised the BVB profit for their salary partition failure, which is supposed to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their loss of salary has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in Merchandising on short work."
Little miracles: Early start in life with a few hundred grams
A little harder than a packer butter, just three dish spoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he wog exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 early children who are cared for annually at the Grazer Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weighs less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully trained.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could hurt the electrodes of an ECG.
And they're so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and specially made mini rings for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be with voice - "and like," Berndt URLesberger smells.
"Even if they don't cry as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage had the 9th classes of the Sankt-Jakobus-Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holiday.
The actress Julia Sylvester from the theater of the city of Aalen presented the production "The Home Dress" to the pupils - by video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange themselves with the actress and director Winfried Tobias via Skype.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of teaching.
Although at the conclusion all parties agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional irritation, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to playing," stressed director Winfried Tobias.
First round released: The TSV in 1860 would meet in the DFB pole on incarnation Frankfurt
If the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB population, the lions will meet in the first round on the entry of Frankfurt.
This was the result of the release on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty-six possible opponents in the first round of the DFB pocal stands firm.
The lions would meet with Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was done on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the participant field is not yet complete because of the Corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the evacuation process.
The TSV in 1860 is already in the final position of the Bavarian Toto Pole (4. or 5. September) due to the voluntary refusal of half-final opponents FC Memmingen.
There the lions meet either on the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If two-tliga uprising Würzburg reached the finale, sixty would already be qualified firmly for the first round in the DFB pool.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to end up playing against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB pole will be carried out between 11 and 14 September and a week before the thirdliga start.

The film ran in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (Die Erbin).
A lot of recognition was given to her as a neurotic excentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Grube".
In 1952, Daphne du Maurier proposed her main role in the filming of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The piece became a global success.
With her long-standing friend Bette Davis, she played in "Weighenlied for a body".
From marriage to writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), the son of Benjamin came out.
In Paris de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.

Kalbitz-Rauswurf from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fishheet"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the view of the FDP only a "fig sheet" and does not change anything to the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the legal expressions in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only a part of the top of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
On Saturday in Stuttgart, after several hours of negotiations, the Bundesgerichtsgericht der AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board had decided in May.
Kalbitz is Chairman of the AfD Group in Brandenburg's Landtag.
"If the AfD really wanted to remove legal extremists consistently from their party, functionaries like Björn Höcke and its followers would have long been excluded," said Strasser.
"But there is no political will in the AfD because legal extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded, doesn't say anything and doesn't change anything," he said the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many French supporters still have a legal expression in the middle of the AfD."
Flower assumes that the AfD will again land under five percent in the future when elections take place.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are counted."
Kalbitz was one of the spokesman of the officially dissolved "flies" around the Thüringer AfD country and group president Björn Höcke; constitutional protection acts as "protected right extremist strife".
In May, the AfD Bundesvorst Kalbitz had thrown out of the party.
As a reason he claimed that Kalbitz had not given an earlier membership in the meanwhile forbidden legal expressions "Tomath faithful German Youth" (HDJ) and in the Republicans.
Kalbitz disputes the membership of the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-fraction at the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Bundesgerichtsgericht did not change the character of the AfD: "The Wolf has eaten only Kreide.
The AfD remains an extreme right party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
This decision does not weaken the Federal Party or the right wings.
"The manoeuvre of the meuthen trunk is perceived.
One wants to escape a further observation through constitutional protection and tries to pass under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD won't get rid of the spirits she called.
There is no change in a rush there," commented the SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD country association and the Group held to this day as their right leader."
The legal dispute about the membership of Kalbitz in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he was going to act against the decision of the Federal Court of First Instance.
Nordsee-Windparks deliver well 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea drove 11.51 torahwatt hours of electricity into the network.
These are good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet informed in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea stream to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity network.
The wind plants on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network area, have supplied further 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) electricity.
In total, the wind current from the North and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to well 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest on the sea represents almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher production capacity
In addition to wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher production capacity because new wind farms have been on the network over the past 12 months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running with full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatt electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatt.
It is expected to rise to 17 Gigawatt in the German North Sea until 2030.
"In Germany and in the Netherlands, we invest 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections," said Tennet business leader Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity on the sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatt electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind wheels produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide electricity for almost seven million households.

Freital: Windbergfest for Corona canceled
The Windberg festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We have certainly not made this decision easy and hoped - in the sense of how difficult it is for the parties - until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partyless).
"But, in the end, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here."
For if tens of thousands were flown into the fixed ground and the fixed tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking could not be complied with in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation.
Or the limitations would have been so strong that a folk festival wouldn't have left much.
In addition, the organizational and surveillance burden would increase by an uneven number of times.
Rumberg was disturbed next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100-year existence, among other things, with the Winter Mountain Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the day of Saxony from 10 to 12 September 2021.

Next more flight slots in Worms
The Worms University continues to ventilate: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" creates a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS was now signed in Worms.
The contract was first concluded for three years and started in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to enable the study start not only in summer but also to the winter semester.
This enables twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacity is evenly exposed at both the university and the Air Safety Academy of the DFS.
The DFS will advise the university in the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester in 2019, the first students have been training for flight slots at the University of Worms in the Air Traffic Management course.
This year nine students started.
The experiences of the DFS have been very positive so far, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy economically.
However, we are firmly expecting that air traffic is recovering and in the long term growing again.
In order to fulfil our legal order in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the DFS in signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-profit investment that will provide flight slots with a broad, technically cross-border knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer".
This also underlines Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the University of Worms: "The foundation professorship is an important bridge between science and economy.
With it we would like to join the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor Study Programme Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German Air Safety Authority is for the University of Worm's motivation and at the same time the obligation to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future areas of air transport.
With the use of tomorrow's flight slots, the university with the first foundation professorship for a dual course of study could set very special highlights and innovative priorities for their students.
Dr. Denis Alt, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Science, Training and Culture, emphasizes: "The University of Worms, with its focus on air transport, has an all-configuration feature in Rheinland-Pfalz.
The signature of the cooperation agreement today strengthens the profile of the university".

Healing wants to check for meat industry other industries
The Corona crisis reappeared the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
Law deteriorations are in the near future.
But are they right - and will it stay there?
Federal Minister for Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries in accordance with the strict rules on misconduct in the meat industry that are now planned.
"We will look at the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective sector if necessary," said Heil the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employer already warns against general restriction of working contracts.
After the massive corona outbreak at the Fleischriesen Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the German cabinet wants to decide a law of salvation on this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should not be allowed to use foreign workers in the case of slaughter, demolition and meat processing.
To do so, the use of work contract workers and loans is to be prohibited.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said: "Finger away from a general restriction of work contracts and worker leave, if you do not want to completely throw off the economy".
Working contracts, for example, are compelling the basis for large areas of craft, construction and plant construction.
"The errors of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Healing assured: "My goal is not to prohibit work contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are useful.
"When an industrial company orders a craftsman to install a security system, this is a very normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and loan work alone in its industry to be constitutional.
It should not be explained why cheese should be transported and packed in the future different labour law than in the case of worst, says an opinion on the legislative project, as reported in the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Samsday).
Consequently, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many Eastern European workers from works contract firms worked in the industry after the results of an examination of the NRW Labour Protection Administration partly 16 hours a day.
Often they had no break.
Remuneration was reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation was often miserable in the housing of employees.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force in 2017 for the meat industry.
However, these have been circumvented by "trucky constructions".
"Now basically must be cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to decide in the cabinet at the end of July, are also measures not only concerning the meat industry - for example higher testing rates in the field of labour protection or clear criteria for Community undertakings".
The draft of the dpa includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry and the labour protection law.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would wish that we could make even more controls in many areas of supervision: food control, animal protection, everything possible, for example animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more personnel are also needed for more controls.
Three dead in the event of crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany

A child was slightly injured.
Two more people had been saved in the calamity, said a speaker of the Wesel circuit board.
A parachute was found at the accident site, the police said.

Car skips: Young woman seriously injured in case of accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at 13.25 p.m.
She was brought to the Klinikum Kassel.
With heat frame cameras, the firefighter was looking for possible riders.
According to the police on the Bundesstraße 83, the woman was on the way to her place of residence Hümme, when her car came out of previously unexplained cause from the motorway and overlaid several times.
In order to save the accidents, the firefighter had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether someone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the rotary ladder with a heat picture camera.
The Drohnenstaffel from Warburg, who also works with heat frame cameras, was also ordered for the search for persons.
However, the forces did not find anyone between the high maize plants.
Heavily injured was brought to the Kasseler Klinikum with the rescue car.

Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming gate by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in series.
The team around the five-time world footballer perfected the total of 36th Scudetto of the club history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo met at 1:0 before the mid-term.
With 83 points, Turin, who did not get to the last long injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer exaggerated from one place for two games before the end of the series A season.
The Inter Milan table side is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless in spite of optical superiority in the first half of the time, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a release.
The 35-year-old used to play Miralem Pjanic directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved on 2:0, after his shot dusted Federico Bernardeschi (67.).
This ensured the glossy but crucial success.
The foulelfmeters sprayed to the late in the 89th minute only Ronaldo itself should have been very angry with a view to the Torjäger valuation.
"It is complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," explained Trainer Maurizio Sarri after 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the spiritual exhaustion of his players is great, said Juve-Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin people couldn't make the championship perfect yet.
Lastly, Juve also owes the weakness of the competitors to the end of the calming advance at the table tip.
Because in the eleven parties before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only succeeded in five victories.
Whether Ronaldo is still going to be a gatekeeper king is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has reached 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile, after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the Table Quarter Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, already has 34 hits on his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the FC Bayern title gain.
The record in Italy holds the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentineian achieved 36 goals for the SSC Naples in 2015/2016.
In August, the "Alte Dame" of the Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus is on the eight-eye final of the Champions League, but on August 7th, he must compete against Olympique Lyon with a 0:1 playground in order to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal authors recorded
Stuttgart - All threatened penalties and judicial judgments Despite the fact that automobile drivers in countless illegal races on the bath-worth-temberg roads continue to give gas: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal authors.
There are no comparative values for the previous years, but the lawns are increasingly working on the judicial authorities: In 2018, a total of 155 investigation procedures for illegal races were conducted at the state prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later, 252 were already and in the current year until the beginning of June 151.
The races involved less organized events, as the Interior Ministry responds to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases the drivers had spontaneously attacked each other or they had taken the escape from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
In particular, German men between the ages of 18 and 60 stayed at the tax.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the lawns caught and also asked for cash: The Ministry of Interior said that a total of 113 penalties have been imposed since 2018 and 15 penalties have been issued.
But there are no indications that the number of illegal authors actually rises.
Rather, other drivers have responded more sensitive than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of the past years and have been more frequent, said one ministerial speaker.
In Rasern the highway is particularly popular 8. Always brake car drivers out there to provide space and use the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen driver was caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months before even 18 drivers at the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "Rennstrecke"
On the A81, the police registered even more races than on any other German motorway.
With a pace limit, there is attempted to brake the grasses on the particularly affected section between narrows and geisings.
The most high-priced and moist sports and luxury carbs often have Swiss marks, because the drivers avoid racing to Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and author races in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the pace limit should not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres of hours, we would create this problem on highways," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD country-day fracture.
"The inhibitor threshold for lawns would be significantly higher if you would not be legally on 200 kilometres and more on the road here and there."
Rivoir holds less of information or image campaigns: "He who in this way ignores all rules and does not only risk his own life, but also the life of other traffic operators is hardly accessible with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
On the other hand, the ADAC is not enough: "We assume that Raser cannot be deterred from the pace limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and the Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also more stringent controls on the routes concerned.
Not often, the high-tourning force measurement becomes more painful and following serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races throughout the country, of which two unparticipated at a nighttime crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
There, two young men were supposed to have delivered an authorenne in November.
One of the vehicles came down from the street, collapsed against a garden wall and remained on the side that died 18-year-old riders.
21 other people have been injured in the races of the past two years.
However, heavier penalties are not necessarily required by Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "The need for action to sanction illegal motor races is not seen," says the Ministry of Interior.

Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning trips - Police attacks, 700 vehicles and about 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated in a "tuning trip" on the parking space of a furniture house on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to strengthen control of such events.
A large tuning meeting came in Nuremberger Südstadt on Saturday evening (25 July 2020).
Several hundreds of vehicles were involved.

Illegal tuning trips in Nuremberg: Little part of the scene
The officials counted at the top of well 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police accounted for.
However, only a small part of the attendees of the autoposer and tuning scene should be allocated.
Obviously, the majority of the scene in question came to the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the on-site vehicles and persons, it should be assumed that it was primarily actuators.
In addition, the majority of the attendants in the existing infection protection provisions, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wear of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site control measures had been completed at 1:00 p.m.
Overall, the officials in 10 vehicles found such structural changes that the operating permit had been lost.
Four of these vehicles had to be ensured.
No authors
Illegal authors didn't exist.
"The Police Bureau of Central Drinks will keep an eye on the event and continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the emergence of sculptors," it said.
The Agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the participant swiping company: "They have all beautiful rocks that we cannot scratch," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to damage.
"Young people should finally keep their cars back without prejudice."
Numbers of work agency: 900 suspicious cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Labour Agency (BA) is according to its own statement about 900 suspicious cases of abuse in the short worker's money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies who have shown short work," said Daniel Terzenbach, CEO of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
At the beginning of the Corona crisis, when many companies suddenly requested short work, the BA had to respond quickly.
Usually the test lasts up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available in this hot phase.
We'll look at the final accounts more precisely.
I'm sure it'll be a lot more.
We are not naïve there and have a long breath".
Remarks on abuse are often made by the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to identify misuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA prepares for a possible insolvency drum in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we wake up for the case and already train our employees in the working agencies for the processing of insolvency fees applications."
The figures are still inconceivable, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden Solved
Potsdam - On Friday evening about 40 young people celebrated a party in the new garden.

The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests for Corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as the national authorities reported in Linz.
More than 100 results were still in the evening.
Accordingly, many of the infected young practitioners are in tourism companies, but at least one guest has been tested positively.
Residents, guests and tourist workers were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The lock hour was set at 23 o'clock.

North Korea locks off border town to Corona suspicion
To date, North Korea has seen a "lightening success" in its own defense measures.
Now the country reports for the first time about a suspicion case.
Because of a first official Corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely locked down a major city because of fear of a disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological defence measures in the past six months, "the malicious virus could have been dragged into the country," the state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership called out the highest level of alarm.
If the suspicion is confirmed, it would be the first official infection case with Sars-CoV-2 in the fired country.
North Korea had so far not registered any infection according to its own information and described his defense measures as "lighting success".
The information was doubted abroad.
According to the reports, the symptoms of the disease were identified by a "reducer" who illegitimately crossed the military demarcation line between South Korea and North Korea on 19 July.
The person had moved to South Korea three years ago and had now returned over the border.
There was no confirmation from South Korea for the crossing of the border within the four kilometres wide and mostly maimed military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, reportedly by the National News Agency Yonhap, recognized the possibility of an illegal crossing to North Korea.
There were investigations to some people.
According to North Korea, on Saturday an urgent meeting of the Worker Party's Polit Office, chaired by the managing officer Kim Jong Un, called on its own information.
The "hazardous situation in Kaesong could cause a fatal and destructive disaster".
On Friday Kim had already ordered a preventive action to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others," it continued.
The data subject, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had been in contact with them, had been placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore intended to investigate the "relapse" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and to impose, where appropriate, severe punishment.
It is estimated that some 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Voltage before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still ahead of a large summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental topics, the committee members will also vote on the construction plan for the large urban development east project", says it in the middle part of the urban press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28th at 16.30 p.m. in the Grand Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, the upgrading of the eastern city is being discussed controversially until the end.
The majority of these are scarce, lastly rejecting even in individual committees depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), which was developed from the citizenship and then from the administration and municipal council, not to fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponents Reinhard Klein as "except parliamentary opposition", "unreasonable", "speculation", "suppression" and "conscious false statements".
"All of us think it is better to know," says Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the citizens' list Pforzheim.
In fact, he is after reading the Treaties in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit is cheaper to the city that the Technical City Hall is in spite of statements by the city administration according to grants, whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than in the town hall and on the part of the beneficiaries of the economy.
The City by its own strength rather than by creating an investor: this is his plan B. One day after little, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides essentially for the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the openkeeping of the castle, the renting of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller downtown transformation in ideal case with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, including many tempo reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of speed 30. However, politically responsible people in the city are not innocent of this because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus to noise, according to the VCD, by neglecting line bus traffic with diminished tacts.
The Council also agrees on the participation of the city of the Pforzheim/Enzkreis Energy and Climate Protection Agency.
In addition, there is the agenda for accession to the Land of Baden-Württemberg's Climate Protection Pact, the re-definition of parental contributions in the urban children's day facilities and the request for inclusion in the Smart City promotion of the Federal.
Citizens are welcome, but Corona must respect protective measures.
With a lot of delay Tim Zimmermann starts in the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts in his premier season at ADAC GT Masters on 31 July.
Before the league of the supersport cars can start the regular operation, the first test trips were now on.
For Zimmermann it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking on his first service trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first rounds on the Lausitzring and was accustomed to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go differently into the curves.
But it really made a lot of fun."
Fun also had roomman with Steijn Schothorst, with which he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years of experience in GT-Sport, the Dutch has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motor sports, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand ourselves blendingly, and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also carry out its first race.
From July 31 on, the 33 supersport cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 serial new ones, knows the route.
He was last guest at Motodrom in 2015.
"It worked quickly and I had little to get used to the route," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafener Renngemeinschaft Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to meet optimally in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann is then real, that's in two weeks.
"The teams, of course, poker a little at the tests," he says.
"But finally we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely pushed calendar.
Seven races will take place until early November.
Currently standing is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, Niko Hülkenberg will take ex-form-1-pilot into the GT steering wheel.
British Minister for Transport of Quarantäne decision caught cold
According to press reports, the decision of the British Government to place Spain's authors under quarantine for two weeks after their return, has caught the State’s Minister for Transport cold.
As a result, Grant Shapps is currently in Spain on vacation, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Due to the corona numbers rising in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which a entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to go back to quarantine after it has returned.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returners.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on the date of holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is regarded as one of the "safe countries" in Austria, which does not require quarantines in Austria.
"Summary ministers should have known beforehand that there is a possibility that a quarantine for holidayers will be imposed on Spain," commented the Labour Deputy Diane Abbot.
"But obviously no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapp's."
Nearly one month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict baseline barriers, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists are particularly responsible for the new spread of night life.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday countries of the British.
The British government is currently depriving of unnecessary travel on the Spanish mainland, the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, particularly popular in the case of British holidaymakers, are excluded from it.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the new corona virus and more than 28,000 dead have been registered in Spain.

FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began for double winner FC Bayern with a relapse.
After a short vacation and a few training days, Hansi Flick recovered "sometimes well" after the first team training, he has to consider how he can reconstruct his successful defense after the injuries of World Master Benjamin Pavard.

"We have to go through the door for the first time.
We want to win, create good conditions and tank trust with a good game," Flick demanded.

He welcomed 31 players at the Sebener Straße, including the new stakeholders for Edel shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all new colleagues on the place after his change from Manchester City.
"Leroy has put himself well like all new ones," reported Flick.
However, instead of talking about the new season when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to participate, Flick would rather talk about the current title project of the German Series Champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now trained for the Londoners, which are opposed to the Flick ensemble in the game rhythm.
After that, the Munichers could have a quarter finale against the FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-final, real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the finale in Lisbon "is not so easy," stressed the Chief Coach, who can trust in the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.

With his current team, the work is "a pleasure", Flick praised.
The "focusedness on gains" is an impressive nature of his team.
At the tournament with Neuner teams, it was also ambitious on Sunday.
All of the performers were involved, including the immigration-willing Thyago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the king's season is not secured.

Furthermore, the concerns of some teams that do not want to drive in Brazil would not justify cancellation.
We are prepared for the security measures required.
Greta Thunberg: Bad view against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in the well-known Lassight show by Stephen Colbert via video switche and told her what she had in her interview with Donald Trump.
Climateatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest by video switch in a popular US-Latenight show.
She told, among other things, about her fight against the powers of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" at her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - In the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg, with her tireless use for the "Fridays For Future" movement, took the attention.
Now she spoke in a well-known Letight show about her plans in the future, as well as her encounter with US President Donald Trump at the UN Climbiple last year.
Latight-Moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg in your mission on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish.
She spoke not only about their fight against climate change but also about their conflict with the powers of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to divert the focus from the climate crisis," she shaken.
"Everything from organized hatred campaigns to threats only because a group of children goes on the street" she experienced.
Heads of State and leading politicians who spot against them in social media or even try to silence them find "pleasant" because they show the reactions, "because they have no other answer to them".
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw US President Trump a bitterly vicious look back.
At the 2019 UN Climbing Summit in New York, for which the Aktvistin sailed over the Atlantic, her impressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image, which eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. President at this moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open-looking question, she answered briefly undryly: "To be honest, I think that doesn't need any further explanation."
With the complete answer, the experienced Satiriker Colbert had probably not counted and disappeared from the picture shortly laughing.
With her "How dare you?"-Rede on the principles of climate protection, she remained in memory of many at the climate conference.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a motorway drive: after a rapid ascension with Fleetwood Mac, it went steep downhill and then slowly upwards.
Now the Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green died at the age of 73.
Genial guitarist, drug junkie, cult adherent: The co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He had died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, members of the family informed on Saturday in an official opinion that another opinion would be announced for the next days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all previous and present members of Fleetwood Mac band.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-standing legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamed instrumental hit "Albatross" is forgotten.
The musician's life ("The End of The Game", "In The Skies") seemed to be a trailer.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There should have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group for beneficial purposes.
He began to appear in large garments and with large crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
In 1970, Green left the band.
There was a social decline.
The Bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time Green was treated in the psychiatrie.
During a large part of the 1970s, the musicians disappeared from the surface of the image.
He was supposed to live on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli Kibbuz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
He was enthusiastic for US blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At 11 years of age, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teen began to play professional guitar and five years later got the chance to stand on stage as a leader guitarist for the instrumental band of Peter B's Looners.
He was part of the Bluesbreakers as a substitute for his Idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the Blues tree, Green founded in summer 1967 Fleetwood Mac together with his Bluesbreakers Colleges Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it at the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid ascension soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not handle the media rommel, its experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number-1 hit."
By the end of the decade, Green 1979 succeeded in a success of respect with an album inspired by religious topics.
Fleetwood Mac swims without him in new formation on a success wave.
Her album "Rumours" published in 1977 sold more than 40 million times around the world.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not get a larger comeback until he started with a group of friends in 1996.
The British "Daily Telegraph" then spoke of a rock star returned to the earth.
With the Peter Green Splinder Group, Green released some albums free of drugs until the band was dissolved in 2004.
For music experts, he was a blues legend at lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists in the past decades.
