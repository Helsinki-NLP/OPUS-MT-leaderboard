The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the most value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# big-scale, so it's not a problem for me.
Need only a number or instruction that I should attach to the package so that it can be struck by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I honestly think that is very angry.
Should I cancel the order and re-order for the better price or is there another possibility of credit?
I also think that children should not be told to take a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones.
Let's watch a little, help a little bit, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help with the family, and are involved.
As long as they can be a child, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is working alone for a short time and it's okay for him, it's good.
It's best for you to determine if it's fit for your kids.
It's not that he should wrap K2 and accompany it for hours while sleeping.
It is probably legally questionable.
So maybe the Psychologist's statement is also coming.
Because if something actually happens like a fire, breakdown, earthquakes, alien invasion etc. it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to enter is of course your discretion;)
Help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a Crimea / Thriller a few years ago, and although I can remember almost the whole action, the title partout doesn't want to come to me again maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and therapy.
At the beginning of the story, a animal career commits suicide by pouring over with food and going to his rap cats.
The case is taken by a Commissioner who, after a brief investigation to his therapists, operates a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a small cousin who also has a fear (for fire) and lands with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is ordered anonymously to go and document the place of suicide and put the photos into the internet before each suicide.
In any event, it turns out that this therapist operates a type of underground therapy group where the patient is planted a chip that is suppressed a fear center in the brain and ultimately puts the patients to their fear in the most extreme way.
(a woman jumps out of the window another drives with intention to die)
This fear is described in the book as "the fight".
At the end there is a large showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That's so the rough action I'm quite sure that the book was written in the original by a French author / author.
If this act is known to someone or someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh ever, I don't have the password for the Wlan.
Let's just contact my husband.
But that can take.
What steps do I have to take after that?
Is it also possible to transfer the price difference ?
Child, 4 j., splitter under the thumbnail
Child, four years, has over the entire length of wood splitters under the thumbnail (outside).
Have tried to pull him with a pinset.
Very hard to grab.
Didn't work and hurt.
Now the child responds hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow's going to the doctor.

Because of Omikron: Johnson wants to promote refreshment vaccination
Always new Omikron cases create politics and science in the UK.
By New Year, all qualified adults in England should therefore receive a vaccination offer.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to advance even faster in the corona amortization vaccinations in view of rapid rising omikron numbers than he has so far sought.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a Booster dose until the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a recorded video message to his countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one faces an emergency, so it was urgently necessary to strengthen vaccination, said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection could be increased by a third dose.
"Let's angry you now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 other Omikron Falls were registered in the UK, with the total number rising to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent.
is the full amount refunded from the purchase price on collection?
I'm for everyone to imagine with pronomans
I sent out a application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
But unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a more complicated name.
I've googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it's either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can anyone help me?
** I am a foreigner and I don't want to step over the feet of officials.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine with pronomans.
A total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
Only that one I bought today is not going
Obviously, the chair had an unappeased deficiency on sale.
How can such a polar damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First on the #PRS_ORG# try.
But it's been working since about.
No more than 14 days.
So I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like to add you 2 chairs to order and take this into account.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I'll write here some detail about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul.
For professional reasons, I (21) come more often in contact with the victims (and offenders) of domestic violence.
A theme that really naked to me and, unfortunately, too often occurs is that many victims do not let themselves help or think we couldn't help them.
I am quite clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are less things in my profession that move me more than if I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in conversation under four eyes, with the offender far out of sight and hearing distance, I can't reach all.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear of revenge to leave fear of the usual social environment, fear of losing the children from this.
What I always want to make clear to all is partly very close to tears, all of them are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But it's never going to be easy.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series do about "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking appearance: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the two seasons already announced?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg near the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was dependent.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giant lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said at the Hakr Merlin's Crailsheim at the beginning of October, with a look back on the pokal layer: "We have some wrath in the abdomen."
But it did not lay after the game - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) low position in the basketball bandesliga.
More than the naked result has disappointed the way of the appearance.
Deputy is a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: The Triple Quote was just 13 percent, 4 hits (also of the young John Patrick) by saying and writing 31 trials - more questions?
The answer was John Patrick: "We were just not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and did not implement what we trained."
To move the ball.
His opposite about Sebastian Gleim reacted: "To win a yellow game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10 000 people."
On Saturday in Hohenlohe-Arena only 750 visitors were allowed, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and directed the game of his team.
"The best player I've ever trained," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team themselves the performance carriers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already relocated 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon came to twelve points.
Fortunately, a lot of time to hate remains not.
Already on Wednesday, 19 o'clock, the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 viewers.
We had a different address before, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've reported myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore written it again.
We originally reported ourselves already half a year ago.
Always poured from the egg: Max Raabe is 59
He can enthusiasticize his audience with new interpretations of beakers from the twentieth and thirties.
At present he is on the way with the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" - if he may occur.
Actually, Max Raabe would have celebrated his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it doesn't make anything out of it.
The planned concert has been relocated in May 2022 - "to administrative instruction" to inhibit the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent period must also occur, as it says on the website of the singer, which becomes 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January onwards, the artists want to pick up their dates already relocated in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-West-Fälische Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot as a youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palace Orchestra together with Kommilitonen.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of Schlagers and Chansons in the style of Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded many times with prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second place of charts, just like his success album "For women this is no problem" (2013).
He made it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair strictly recommended and focused on labels, Max Raabe is no longer to think away from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz: No new apartment is created due to disability
The new Federal Minister for Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the accord of large housing groups, as it was requested in a people's decision in Berlin.
"With an incapacity, no new apartment is created, it only changes the owner's structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent remains payable in the next few years.
A colourful mix from, for example, private owners, cooperatives or housing companies is, by the way, the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the SPD, Green and Left Party coalition wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the people's decision.
However, if the situation is not relaxed, Geywitz did not exclude discussions with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further hardenings in the rental right.
The coalition contract provides a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tended housing markets and the extension of the lease level.
I'm going to talk to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something and after a few days I noticed that I forgot the last step on payment.

That's an absolute freaky
At least 100 dead by tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, many tornados have been pulled through the USA.
Only in Kentucky could more than 100 deaths be complained.
The pictures from there remember a war zone.
In the night on Saturday in the United States several tornados caused severe devastations and possibly demanded up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave an approximately 320 kilometres long snail of devastation, especially in the Kentucky State.
The governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado was pierced, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is at all possible.
He only counts in the Kentucky State with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rising every hour.
Hello, I just saw that she's sold out Vitrine #NAME#.
That's very bad.
Is she still being produced?
Or did she get out of the assortment?
Is there the possibility of ordering these vitrines in another country?
Until when do you report?
If the delivery cannot be made in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, only can I order the blanket now and deliver to Germany who is in the shopping cart?
I had returned a Artike via the contact form or gave up a return and wanted to ask if it was arrived or processed, as I had not yet received confirmation.
Companies pay vaccines and change advertising claims
While the Federal Government continues to reject the proposals for an vaccination premium, companies in Austria themselves have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for vaccination.
They are thus in line with the social partners ÖGB and Economic Chamber, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising blogs to vaccine calls - according to German example - is also intended to increase the readiness to corona vaccinations.
He's changed to a company he's been blaspheming.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year ago.
He obviously did not get stuck in his old place and sought something else.
You can.
And that he didn't like you at that time: well, no matter.
He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That will be legally relevant.
I'm finishing a screen shot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to the greeting!
I just led the adventure for a group of 4 friends About the grippe pass and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big arch is made, the evil weights and their motivations written, the individual acts designed, and now I am writing the adventure and stumbling already at the first encounter about my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a fleet with cereals of Gratenfels into a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The further action is to be developed there.
Some miles away from the village, the hero is supposed to lure a group of Goblins and lure them into a backdrop.
I would like to give the player's character the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize the danger early, whatever happens to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 armed with bows and seals
When not noticed, the Goblins watch the hero in a hollow path and fly to three left and right me arches armed the flockwork, while two with spears stop the flocking work.
If it comes to the fight and the heroes are subject to, I have two solutions
1. The heroes are found and healed by the son of the village school, a half-elephant.
Of course, the car is gone.
2. If a defeat should be indefinite, this half-elf shall take in with two of his servants, and come to the hero in the battle for help.
The car's still there, it's great.
How appropriate do you keep Deus ex Machina of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much to enter the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a decisive role later, so not only cannon feed.
EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I'll guarantee many of your ideas and have more confidence in my narratives now.
I built the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I would like to send her back
If you can then let the backshots come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the #PRS_ORG#.

Is everything picked up again or only part of the storage room?
I am generated by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased increasingly, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all today, the transfer was canceled in the middle of the F2 race to allow the F1 pre-reporting on time.
Although due to the delayed beginning and the start accident of the schedule was far behind the planning, one could still show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
It seems, however, that for legal reasons, the F1 has to take priority and therefore have to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Still stupid, since Sky UK has transferred the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Schwarzyes has well accompanied the difficult situation about the serious accident.
Then, in the F1 again, there was regular innocent knowledge with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that one could change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that stepping may change the tyres when there were corresponding radio claims on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for stepping.
I think you should know such basic rules simply when you comment on the F1 with a pay TV sender.
It is also not the first raad of puzzles, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both have just constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
Generally liked with the artificial comment style of roos, but admit that the taste is.
But I really like the Heiko water from RTL.
There are constant nasty things that make both simply unprofessional, such as the ordering of coffee by the (also unreasonable) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of unrest in the comment that he apparently does not take it seriously.
Not least, the advertisement simply takes place at Sky, in the run-out round, Sky is the only sender to the advertisement, as you can listen to F1TV as only the German tone track without comment has to come out immediately after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do it.
These two channels also make less advertising in the trainings than Sky, and that as free TV channels.
Although you have to praise Glock and tree gardener for their work, this alone does not leave me over the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very drought and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that transmits the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job up to the advertising at the four races they can still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable sender.
I'd be interested in your opinion.
On the here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendelleuchte, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice and nothing until now.
The first lady told me it was sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check an email and send and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already had a defect after relatively short time (the substance has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent to provide an aquarium with oxygen in addition.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants of us.
See the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate whole plants with it.
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable for connecting more outflowers.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the model fan pump, but it also offers itself to set an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find with us in the shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasured rest, a shell or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-sensitive design and thus provides low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an auströmer o.ä. by means of an air sludge 4/6 mm and it can start.
The ventilator pump should be equal, or higher than the water level and be attached outside.
Sits the fan pump deeper than the water level should you put a reverse valve in between.
Simply cut the air hose and put the valve in between.
This would prevent once water run backwards, which runs the water out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is put outside, you should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time of 3 days here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up every day here.
If everything's going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to avoid a little so that no one is convinced just because it took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the field of expedition... naturally here doesn't stop corona.
Please do not judge badly, just because the delivery is delayed, that's only due to the package services.
Of course, one likes to shame about these services, even if we say at the moment, they've got it hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Do not be evil to anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there are also better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrests?
Can you order your legs in light here?
Amazon-Gründer Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first U.S. American in All, a TV moderator and four other passengers took a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" missile system of the company Blue Origin of Amazon-Gründer Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the west of the state of Texas.
Under radiant blue sky Bezos took up the most personally the freshly crippled astronauts after their return.
"Will come back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue room suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and embraced the Amazon founders.
According to Blue Origin, they were travelling ten minutes and 13 seconds, reaching a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa Astronaut to All flew Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company who paid four passengers for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not communicate.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard in his efforts and do everything himself.
She was just flying, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also excited.
He'd like to return to all again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers height
The "New Shepard" missile system flows largely automated.
The capsule separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, temporarily with gravitylessness, before the reusable object braked from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-run trip from Blue Origin: at the first time in July, Amazon-Gründer Bezos was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutch.
At the second year of October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who was world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", also the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics propose Bezos and Blue Origin to promote the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests in the welfare of humanity and without regard to the climate.

Someone who is working in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and actually find the subject quite exciting and also standing in the laboratory does not disturb me (have already been the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, before studying, I also thought about professional prospects at the time that I certainly want to study and become up to the promotion.
At present, however, I have some doubts, especially as oppressing me the job prospects.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc) one hears great professional opportunities and the job is totally sought, on the other hand one hears from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs again and again.
That's why I'd really be interested in:
1) As what are you currently working?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/payment?
3) What have you studied/What training did you do?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I'm really uncertain at present and think that 2022 may cancel the study and make a training as a specialist computer artist.
If you have experiences that also like to write :)
Extra stress before holiday & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax from it.
That's why it's just a pistol.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, there are the holidays as well as bridge days.
It was like this: last week, Mary was arriving, called "ascending" at us in Switzerland.
On Friday the most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week there was a long four-day weekend in the house.
So what was going on last week?
Overall stress.
Hard e-mails that were absolutely hard to get out of the drive, order here, all *unconditional* before the long weekend.
'Cause... 'cause?
Because "Next week then" sounds like so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to afford all seriousness in a short week as much as in a normal?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also strongly absorbed.
What's this self-aid about holidays?
What do we have to do with holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all so self-employed.
My question is: Are we only like that, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical kind?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld looks forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) looks forward to Christmas in their Thuringian home - but has no gifts yet.
"The beautiful, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, you simply go to Ilmenau in the Thüringer Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by baking and bastling with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the senseful days she has to do a few more things: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I have to leave now at last."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of mouses and feather rebuilding.
NECTON bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg biotin/kg.
NECTON bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy feather.
The majority of feather damage occurring in birds are based exclusively on dietary errors.
Since the feather is made up of protein-resistant substance, the bird is a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition required for the formation of a well-equipped feather.
For working metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occur during the mouse are based on lack of or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedingstuffs is explicitly and balanced.
No other vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NECTON bio is cold water soluble and can easily be administered via the drinking water or via the soft feed.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, still not functioning
DDR-Handwerksmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/DR, the locot was in use in Schlesien and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably comes from the reconstruction proposal of the model iron trainer ME Heft 11/1968, used with game tracks and defects see photos, function good, The series E 95 is a heavy freight train electrocomotive of the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), which has been designed for the traction of heavy coal ganz trains in the Silesian network, perhaps also from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are working on
In 1924, the German Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft had commissioned the AEG to present proposals for an electric locomotive that should be able to transport 2,200 tons of coal trains and 530 tons of passenger trains at 45 km/h travel speed.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined about the delivery as 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzlager-Antrieb AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens-Schuckerwerke with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the delivery of six locomotives received the operating number E 95 01–06.
All of them survived World War II and then found themselves on the territory of the subsequent DDR.
In 1946 the locomotives entered the Soviet Union as a repair goods.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
The Dessau Reichsbahnenverbesserungswerk identified the upgradingness of all six locomotives.
[4] In 1959, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03, with the rest of the machines being used as spare part donors, were developed as a result of the increasing need for locomotives for the heavy freight train service with progressive reelectrification of the medium-German network.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94 were preferred in larger numbers.
Only when the E 94 saw that the number of workups could not be further increased, the E 95 came into the viewpoint of the workup.
[4]The locomotives were first stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway station.
They came to Halle P.
They were mostly used in their own circulation plan before coal trains from the hostel towards Hall, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematicly, at an age, the complicated control of locomotives proved to be.
So it was more often that shelters stayed glued at switching.
Then the beetle on this locomotive had to resolve the shelter during the journey with hammer and wooden keel.
The damage to the motors occurred more often and led to months of failure at the locomotive.
[5] Since at the end of the 1960s there were enough new building locomotives and a significant expansion of the electrical operation was not planned at the time, the E 95 could refrain from the realm of old locomotives and most of the breakdowns, so that the E 95 were excluded.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn only wanted to occupy electric locomotives once again, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the above difficulties with the machines and visions of the driver's stand.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were posted in mid-1969, they followed the E 95 01, which stopped the service on October 5, 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives were demolished until the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was set up as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a soft heating system at Halle Hauptbahnhof.
It took a while to convince those responsible at the Reichsbahn that the E 95 was preserved as museum locomotives.
In 1979, the first outer construction of the locomotive began to present them to a vehicle view in the RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has been part of the Transport Museum of Dresden as an inappropriate museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale), the locomotive museum is cared for.
Since 1995, employees of the Traditionsgemeinschaft Bw Halle P have been working on the operational upgrading of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive could be presented for the first time to a exhibition in the Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new inner and outer paint, with the transformers checked and five motors operated.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Schlesische Gebirgsbahn and the deteriorating sides, where they proved themselves on the basis of their reliable drive and low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machinery in Leipzig became the medium-sized German network.
The main area of use was at first Schlesien
Handworks model H0 in OVP, function good, there are optical reworking at the locot necessary in self-work, dusted, with game tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handwork model, very small edition- the kit may also come from the small series company SCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging can contain labels and storage traces.
Yes, the F-shapes are it
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle bar is held by two feet.. Dressers are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, which are unfortunately defectively produced.
The middle bar does not fit in the intended holding.
So I'm going to get new.
When are they sent out?
no planes.
These are, according to the assembly instruction the right of the form, they were just too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
Their main purpose is to be met
They're not flat with me
Could I get these sent?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two light-injured and high damage
Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Oberbayern.
In addition, an estimated damage in the six-digit euro area has been caused, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech).
According to two residents were taken to the hospital with light smoking poisoning on Sunday.
The exact cause of fire was not known at first, but the police did not deliberately fire.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But it's coming a lot later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To deflect Fake news - Biontech-CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination at the beginning of 2021 on the social network "LinkedIn".
Biontech Chief Uğur Şahin had not spoken publicly to his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur published a photo showing its corona vaccination.
The disease of a friend moved him to, told Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainzer company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo that shows how it gets vaccination against the corona virus.
There was false information in the social media that I was not supposed to be vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a contribution in the network "LinkedIn".
"Since a few months, friends have urged me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counteract these wrong rumors."
He has so far rejected this because communication should not turn around himself.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply sad when I learned that an old school friend of me is currently fighting for his life.
He fights against a severe covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a respiratory device for three weeks.
The schoolfriend and his family were not vaccinated, continued to write.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be anxiety that is often furnished by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can hardly be fighted with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he was not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle clarified itself.
"I am not allowed to get the vaccine myself at the time by law," said Şahin at that time.
There is a priority in Germany in the vaccination of the vaczine.
In the meantime, the priority has been raised for a long time - and the Biontech chief has been able to vaccinate three times according to appropriate information.
Fire in revolving system: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, on Friday evening the light went out: no electricity anymore and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had smashed a revolving station.
After a fire with severe damage in a revolving station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to get out for 24 hours without electricity.
Through the fire on Friday evening, the lights went out in several municipalities with 41,000 affected inhabitants.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday there were numerous emergency aggregates in operation until the large-scale disorder could finally be completely fixed on the late evening.
Fire officers and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The supplier thanked the affected for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the circle, the firearms and the THW for unfortunate use," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few days, since the West Network engineers could initially re-use some lines only provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company data.
Power flows again
The fire broke out on Friday at 19.15 p.m. has severely damaged the information from Westnet in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid station of the 10,000-Volt-Schaltanlage.
There are expensive cleaning and repair work required.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt-spanning level had been established.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday, 18 o'clock, more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had again had electricity.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid had been gradually connected from 21.30 p.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last of the failure had also had electricity.
More than 80 Monteures from West Network and partner companies had been in use.
Following the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings, the authorities also called for neighborhood assistance on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that the citizens in their neighborhood take care of older or single people and share with local firearms houses when needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the construction and operation of emergency aggregates, the inhabitants of Altenheimen were in focus.
In addition, according to public authorities, temporary care places in schools were set up for those people who were unable to care for themselves or who need current-dependent medical devices or for medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay them in euros?
It is the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy
But I can't mount the undercase on the table plate.
It is Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I can't put it together and thus shorten it.
Can you help me?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased with a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then we do it like that!
Do you send me the return ticket by mail?
The repair is now complete.
I had tried this before the chat.
Before buying, however, I had not restarted the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost undesirable.
We do not agree with this.
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic Combinator Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are printed at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepääe on the podest.

Returns of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have made both s and use the version 4.5...
could be that they have heard of problems more often
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it also seems to be on it.
As soon as I want to open it, the message comes ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrect to report on customer service.
As far as I can recognize it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in the meantime too!
To get the colour order uniformly and clean, you should clean the components with some soap water from dust, fat and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before bringing the brush into the model for the first time with a new color, it is advisable to exercise 2 to 3 stripes.
You can do this on the later not visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first strike on the component
Pull the brush evenly stitch next to Strich.
Light overlap of the color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid wiping quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic areas.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark could look through later.
Metal tones and metal colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, when they mix with normal colors, it can come to unpleasant metal screws.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you grow them.
Originally faithful look reaches the models through the Decals or detractions.
From high-speed signals on planes to ship names to Zieartenste und Kennzeichen bei Automodellen: The Decals give the model the last slippe.
Bring the Decals in the right order, as long as the components are still well reachable.
A plane cockpit can be adhesive or lighter before it is built into the rump.
Even more important than the right tool such as scissors, pinsets and dental tooths are time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each required Decal individually and set it straight to you.
Decals are also called water sliding images because you shortly moist their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wets.
Then you just put the picture a small piece from the paper and put the piece to the corresponding place on the model (which you had already moisturized).
While you hold the Decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper off the side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is sitting right before you put it completely from the paper so that it doesn't stick, knit, or even rip it.
Suction out of stock water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book shortly as soon as I look at something else then I don't read the book and have to log out and log in and reload the book and look for the place where I read.
I've already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get these by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 individual packages with me
Thank you very much.
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
But do I get this back without any trouble?
Children's wish treatment at cars / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were some time in child care, now when it comes to the billing with the PKV, it suddenly crosses.
The series after:
We had requested the child's wish-raising in advance at the PKV and received the promise over 3 trials.
The attempts have not been restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and carried out 2 (successless) attempts, but they did not yet calculate with the PKV.
We again requested the acquisition of costs at the PKV and again received 3 further attempts.
After some further attempts (we have done more trials than promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we passed the bills to the PKV and got the evil surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV wants to reimburse only 3 attempts.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts will fall.
The second child's wish is a new insurance case.
According to the Terms and Conditions, however, "The insurance case starts with healing treatment, it ends if the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here to repay the PKV (only 3 attempts are repaid) or we (there are 5 attempts to repay)?
* Had the PKV had to tell us in the promises that with one birth the further attempts would fall?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (contingent by closed egg ladders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here would give your opinion.
Thank you for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I get them the best again?
All right.
We're not going to order anything with them anymore.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (the same address), they obviously lost good customer.
They can pass this forward to their managers.
This is not competitive.
Last night, the colleague told me that the repayment was caused and now you tell me that I have to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything for getting the commode completely disrupted with me
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote
That is clear and clear that the repayment has been triggered and I have still not received a repayment by #PRS_ORG#
They can justify their manager that they have now lost two stem customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment via his account.
We're not going to do this anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must stop a normal use.
Otherwise, they can't sell him as an office chair.
Depending on this, the guarantee of 24 months applies.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I'll be able to remove the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are acquired with additionally purchased hockers, but we can't unfortunately find these products with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is precisely, there is no general definition with precise budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major movie studio or private investor.
In the network you can find rich lists of low Budget movies, such as letterboxd.com.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What's the matter with you?
And what do you think you don't like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments completely with your furniture.
Would like to ask the best price for the grey Ledersofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this also reliable?
Thank you so much.
With friendly greetings
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes to the waiting position... I'll give up soon again, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Halb victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU
According to Raphael Bossong, in conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory".
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees on Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher at the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This swift state - Belarus does not give up very little, but the EU feels as a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Association with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Obviously, there is a "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not decisively turn against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development at the same time weakens cohesion in the Union.
"It is apparently not possible if a Member State is headed to do its thing," as is currently in Poland, which does not even permit access to the border by the Frontex EU Border Protection Agency.
Moreover, the EU pays a further price for its policies at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy is difficult, as the line of border protection, border protection, border protection had been strengthened.
Re-experience of cross-border
According to Poland’s border protection, migrants have again attempted to reach over Belarus in the Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and brought back to the border, said one speaker of the Authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials had been thrown with stones at the incident near the place of Czeremsza.
According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically cared for by a military doctor.
Overall, border protection registered 52 attempted crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday evening a group of 28 migrants had overwhelmed the border locks.
In recent months, thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried the border between Belarus and the EU.
The EU urges Alexander Lukaschenko to have enticed them with the view to entering the EU as a holder of power in Minsk.
According to Poland and Lithuania, press reports were locking off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that brought migrants and refugees to the country.
In addition, EU Commissioners traveled to countries of origin in order to prevent departures there.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"Then the EU has thrown its market power into the scale and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard ban days and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take account of internal policy costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not contemplated that the security device regularly swallows thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1-finals
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen had two regular breaches during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After Abu Dhabi's controversial Formula 1 final, Mercedes objected.
The silver piles presume two regular breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed infringement of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety-car phase, when it is supposed to have obsoletely overwhelmed.
A second opposition was made against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes-View, the protocol was not followed in line.
In the last round of Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes, the stepping was still overrun and he was racing to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch had overrun driving cars before him.
I'm checking that.
I'll talk to the bank and report to you again.
Thanks for the support

But I'm sorry just because he says he's not an antisemit.
That's as if a rider says he has nothing against foreigners.
Yours will not both admit it.
But Collegah continues to reproduce any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to dismiss yourself, you should just leave it complete.
Yeah, wow then you're just as little serious as Collegah.
Anyone who seriously challenges evolution is simply completely lost.
For my reason, a god has brought the whole thing in progress.
But as soon as you're creating, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and science only confused nonsense.
And so you're a science enemy and don't take any more serious like Collegah.
To get an optimal vision field, the magnification should be close to the eye as close as possible.
The special aplanatic-achromatically designed lens system allows you to use the magnitude up to the edge zone, practically forgiving and color-defect-free.
Lupes are often marked with magnification indications.
However, these information applies only to precisely defined conditions which rarely comply with the conditions of use.
In order to optimise your magnitude, we ask you to observe the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices – i.e. also in the case of valves – light reflections occur.
By an anti-reflex cover, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When adhering to the optimal conditions of use - magnitude close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less perceived.
Further information is available in the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Coins sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced some curiose situation when selling a cocktail.
One time, even without his partner, a man was supposed to have returned home because both could not agree.
Every year, he plants well 2000 pieces for this.
The 56-year-old has already experienced some curiosity situation.
That always makes a little fun for the past night, he says.
What about the voucher?
Otherwise I'm gone as a customer?!
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I'll rate that accordingly!
We do not need discussions on the better court, but there is a certain similarity between them.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spear.
And so both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be like the "Dreher", which does not seem to be so delicious.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent up to a few failures 50 Mbits.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module that is connected to the FritzBox also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which sends the wifi, no longer arrives the full 500, but the further I remove in the house with the module, the less it comes (so use a socket that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms from the other module).
This makes the Internet with the new fibre connection in the first floor even slower than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set that seems to be using a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar major losses here.
Could anyone tell me why with glass fiber so much Internet speed about the power line "lost"?
And is LAN really the some solution?
It would be extremely expensive to move LAN cables in the house.
I'm really desperate, so I've created an extra account here.
That is why I would be more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the Giro account
Anyone who thought was now resting with the giroconons is deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the rate increases in the past with tricks of their customers, the free amounts for negative interest rates continue to drop.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halfed the free amount and even celebrated for the day's money.
In a first step, the border was reduced only for customers of the Group-Sparte Postbank - to EUR 50,000 in Giro and Investment Accounts and to EUR 25,000 for daily cash accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
And not only for new contracts but also for "new individual agreements with stock customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen down to a limit of EUR 50,000, which is still valid, as well as ING Germany.
The DKB, which is particularly popular with the most cost-conscious customers, has reduced the amounts to two levels, first to EUR 50,000, and now to EUR 25,000.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a free amount of €25,000 or less according to the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000, but there is still a legal dispute with consumer centres that have even been entitled to this regulation in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutions might have to make provision - in case the upper authorities also have to explain the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions of bank customers have to be repaid.
The table was delivered for 8 people instead of those for 6 people.
This is for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty Army
She's now officially headed Hollywoods.
But their lives are like a mountain and valley trip.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected from the American magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" to the most influential woman of the year.
For them who made in 2021 with the "Friends" reunification and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show" Furore, this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers will take care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, you can enjoy a chip a day (yes, read correctly: an SINGLE chip from the bag).
The fact is that the hearts of female and male fans fly equally to her is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she just has a pech with luck - and still seeks the great love.
And the baby's wish removed from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Keep hoping that success and glory also make happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönnen must give up
Kimi Räikkön's departure from the Formula 1 was still less than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finne pulled out the gloves and wiped the weld from the forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a light band touching, Räikkönn had to place his Alfa Romeo after not even half of the race distance at the Great Prize from Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the motor sports king class.
His wife Minttu and the two children were also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was the win of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He created 21 Grand Prix victory, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times to the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte victory in Twoerbob - Sports
The Norwegian biathlet's brand Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've taken this out once, I'd have to go nine and a half victory per season, then I could do it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympiazer from BSC Oberbeernburg, who booked two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
First, on Saturday, he resisted the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he drove from rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and went out a larger advance on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbeerenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he joined the British Brad Hall.
The third became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22th victory in series.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, riding for Stuttgart, came to place two earlier this time on rank five.
Christoph Hafer of BC Bad Feilnbach landed eight in the first race after rank.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do that," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
With the women, Laura Nolte won the third seasonal victory on her homeway in the two-bob.
After only the fourth place in the first day of the monobob, she joined the World Cup on Sunday at the German triple success with Deborah Levi.
Two-bob-Olympiazian Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came to rank two with Germany's fastest Sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked the first podest place in this winter next to her Olympia qualification.
The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed on three place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podest place in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but today's start times were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing it, but there's also trumherum a lot to do."
Jamanka annoyed a little about the unfamiliar rides, but said, "It goes in the right direction."
I already had the blanket in my cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I haven't just received it and therefore can't solve it why I finally asked.
Through Corona last year I had quite different problems and never time for it.
And now it said he was expired what very annoyed me.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to give it back and then order again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No only when I get a tip on it comes an extra field with the message
Have been taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered bear.
But we still want the shelf module, just a new undesirable
And don't cancel the whole order.
Only this day, just this week, only until XY...
Hello loves great girls and girls and women,
I have some things I just want to write, and maybe the one thing -- or others...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog emama - sometimes apart from my dog doesn't scream or go into the child's garden he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has taken up a burning 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we have kissed a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because hand is in the association burning).
He is cooled upstairs and we are currently seeing ourselves less (1-2x week) which makes me very happy with my needs for affection and love.
My dog's kid just got a stomach, I've cooked for him, and now he's in his casket and has relaxed a little after I was there with the heat lamp and streaking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and it's just gone for a month.
Now we're still holding homework on us, of course we're splitting up.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well disposed, I'm half-way well therapyd and get ready.
Not good, but I'm ready and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just demands very much (for me), tomorrow at 15h I have a written test for which I have done nothing and overmorning anatomy hour for which I should prepare at least a little something.
And next week I have a oral test on Tuesday, and what's going on is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no place left.
So my week goes like this, only until over morning, then is weekend.
But after that the whole thing is going on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holiday.
Only until weekend.
Just until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I'm just so stressed that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm gonna take it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Are you like that?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Really infinitely grateful, I can't get that in words at all.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think that also has some to do with Mental Load of Women, and that's why I thought I'm sure I'd find suffering fellow women here...
I would like you to have a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have got my order today unfortunately is the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has print.
During the first delivery, the color was just as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we're going to switch the table, I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In the other two times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Something completely different: I found at the time at school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is only another subject for them, such as mathematics or academy.
For me, this was always a bit strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed something like that.
How are you?
You may also be able to tell about work and or study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But if it simply finds it strange to have a physicist who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
If you don’t believe it, what will bring you to want to teach religion?
Culture real or something?
Hope you question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write English I also understand well
That's been a long time, then I'd leave it
It's okay, thank you.
I'm expecting a feedback at the latest at the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Search for movies Help please
Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (about 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it in any case in the real world there's a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (Uniform similar to those of the Caribbean soldiers from the curse).
For some reason the paths cross and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who the woman wants to bring into this empire in order to be able to live myself.
The transition is, I think, also the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that tells you, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one slept only on the abdomen from week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child stops much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is true, no cocklets, go inside and watch, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Ahso and we had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn your head to the side?
Can it get something from the stomach?
Or is it in front of the face directly in the mattress?
You can tell if it's all right.
We have all grown up, and when my husband came to birth, it was like a gang and it was good to put the kids on the stomach to sleep.
In addition, we are already "Stammkunde" with you and have already bought very many items
But why do you offer me only EUR 20?
Hello, I've already written with a colleague from you yesterday, and I haven't reported any feedback yet.
It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the closet.
I ask you to contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To make it clear.
RBTV promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too.
It's simply so that the policy of this transmitter is now under all sauce.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a large bead tour at the same time.
It was said that you were an "independent" Internet channel.
Quote Arno: One wants to be "no running latitude pillar".
What are you doing now?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we got Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult the people.
A Krogman who completely lacks empathy and at the expense of the action with the explosive rented rooms tries to make ash.
How do you think all this is good?
It's great if you like it, I think it's terrible.
I'm asking for Rueckruf because my supplied wooden table was put defectively.

Whether as a comforter at abdominal wow or just to kiss – My little warmth friend is widely used.
Kirschkern pillows are a traditional home for beneficial heat applications, as cherry cores can absorb heat very well and dosate again.
The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant so that the little ones feel secure even if they are not so good.
The cherry cushion with reference to the heat is only suitable for the following applications:
Before heating the cushion, check on untypical smell, stock or fire spots and immediately dispose of it.
Please take the inner cushion out of the reference before heating!
Heat in the microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (beware of the microwave manufacturer's specifications!)
Directly after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inside cushion in the reference.
The first heating can result in a light moisture formation on the surface, but disappears in repeated applications.
You must comply with the warming instructions given, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (deflammation and burning risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer’s instructions for use.
After the warmed inside cushion has been placed back in the reference, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitable for babies (max. 43 °C) at your armbar!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or fever-resistant diseases, circulation complaints, fresh haematoms, blood losses and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain.
In case of existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases and pregnancy, please contact a doctor before administration.
If seams are opened and loose cores are released, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible for children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child should be regularly controlled during use to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The reference is detachable and washable at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!

Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of the return to the Football League.
Hanover 96 works from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it is not running under the third trainer.

Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my power supply.
I bought this again about five months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply is enough to operate on my own.
Error display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the plugged power supply.
That's why I've expanded the battery, but there's nothing going on here.
Vllt have ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can I not use the laptop in the network?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book that?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack of Peak Design, no problem!
20 litres of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without problems that can be safely disposed of using the polished FlexFold participants.
And what else you need on everyday items remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The stylish, minimalistic design has in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack, while still granting customer-facing access to photo equipment.
This works with two possibilities: once conventional via the lid flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch closure system, an excellently thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with the Messenger Bags.
In the closure fold there is a closure hook made of metal with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak design has been looking for different "fills": there are 4 anchor bars, stablely destroyed, in which the locking hooks can be cut.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper.
Cover closure and hooks are also magnetic.
This way the backpack can also be reliably closed without scraping the hook.
The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other, photo-rucksacks: In addition to the lid, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to feel through the content anymore!
At the same time, this smart detail enormously increases the daily suitability of the backpack: for when you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can individually configure the interior (more below) and thus dispose of both problemlessly separately - and access it independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side to the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday things remain safe in the left backpack and do not come in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated wear belts help to do so.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I was in vain on the email of their support.

Would you like another beautiful evening?
hallo, my order is #NUMBER#. When is the article delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
A completely different lamp was delivered to me than I ordered
Please call me.
If you extend me the voucher, I'll give up a larger order, but I've kept the damaged piece of furniture and haven't sent back.
And that last year I couldn't know and couldn't solve it timely and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don't accept that.
Rotinger braking discs are designed to appreciate the requirements of the dynamic driver, who also knows reliability and safety in braking under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made of cast and then mechanically processed (bore and cut).
All coloured discs are manufactured in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are owned for certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that is based on the original assembly characteristics of the disc.
The plates made in this way ensure high comfort and brake effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, with the cuts improving the cleaning of the braking discs and brakes.
Aesthetic properties of our coloured discs underline the character of each car by attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city in which an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered lighting fragments in the water at the southern gift of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49.
Thousands came from close and far and made Coloma one of the country's fastest growing and thriving cities.
Areas were cut off, tents were mounted, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted his share in the riches of the country.
For many it said, "Coloma or Bust" (colomy or bankrott)!
In this game you are a pioneer who seeks riches in the West and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together, and build companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and neighbouring areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overtake your pioneer colleagues in order not to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to victory.
You select your actions simultaneously, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that is more and more for you "work" (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to apply rules for your benefit.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) until 1850 (the year in which California gained official government).
One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will choose a secret location and at the same time a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
Afterwards, their selection is uncovered and they place their pioneers at the appropriate locations.
If a location has most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This deactivates the one half of the location - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players perform alternate actions, such as gaining resources, moving cars, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolves.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the awarder turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the pricer has moved five times, so every location has once hidden and ends the year.
There is a shooting in which players must defend Coloma before an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough rebel heroes and are countlessly superior to the bandits, they receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end on the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player with most victory points wins!

"Why children aren't tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediathek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I've watched it right now.
>The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is happy to be a guest in talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become tyrants" (2008), he triggered a severe debate on education.
Former patient: women and educators now raise serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We parents and other responsible people never, never, never! for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to raise the frame for the child as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise the removal of the test obligation for three-fold vaccines
At its next meeting, the Ministers for Health in the Member States want to decide on a federal removal of the test obligation for three-fold vaccines.
"We countries need quick clarity, whether and from when the test duty can be taken for three times", said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, the "Image on Sunday".
The removal of 2G plus for three-fold vaccines is "not only medically useful, but also provides an additional Impfanreiz", said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed that he will make a proposal to the Health Ministerial Conference the next Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back.
How am I doing that best?
Hello, I like the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer handle my #PRS_ORG# shopping.
Display: Ups, an error occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer goes.
I updated account data.
What can this be about?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, i.e. sense perceptions under full narcosis.
These occur with a frequency of approx. 1 to 1000.
The most common thing is to listen to noises/ voices, more rare to see images and most rarely to perceive pain.
Relevant to this topic: Emperor cuts are operations that come with an increased rate of Awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia for the protection of the child until the abnorption.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthetic talk.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Love all, this comment of me describes Awareness correctly, but** u/Nitemarex had **per definition none.
Have read their comment incorrectly.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ does not help us.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
This is also standard in the field of eCommerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if at least they take back the defective chair.
We'll sell the second chair privately.
We lose a lot of money.
I've already sent you a mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
In order and invoice, the goods are delivered up to a room of my choice.
The expeditor is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only delivered before the door, because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know a person who can wear me the heavy furniture in the first floor.
Isn't I called?
I had put forward a question
Theatre historian Günther Rühle died 97-year-old
He profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theater story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, printed freshly: "An old man gets older."
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell from the world that led by the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the message comes that the author died.
The last sentence in the book is: "I've already witnessed my life thanks here."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Europeletts, standard wood pallets, which are used mainly in the European area as charge carriers.
They are certified by the European Palettes Association EPAL
According to statistics Austria in Austria, more than ten million pieces of pallets were produced in 2020.
The production value was around EUR 79 million.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually is not collected

Raw Tips & Tricks
I had gotten a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulasch.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterfly!
So thank you again for this :)
Now I have come to taste and want to cook to the New Year's Rouladen for the first time.
Tomorrow I'll use a bovine fountain for this.
You got some tips for me else?
Note: I have no oven, but only a big pot.
How's it going?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't that good anymore, but I get it
IIt's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money hasn't come in with me.
Please check that.
Where there are Christmas breads in the Lübeck room
For many people, Gans or ducks are among the Christmas days such as the tan tree and the gifts.
You didn't get any poultry yet?
Now the time will be short.
We'll tell you where you get a Christmas bread in the Lübeck room.
The "Drive" of a tube end level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circulation.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controller, you can set the desired level and on the other hand the decay content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything at the "gain" and the distortion.
More above, it has already appeared that with the POWER LEVEL controller you can even make a power reserve fleet when it goes unheardly loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in every situation.
The headphone book can also be used as line output.
The signal in this area is handled with a boxing simulation, so that you can get a eminent "acoustic" impression even when you use a headphone or direct recording.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX book, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate voice device.
If you donate a VFS5 footkey, you can also easily call the sounds by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and "take" the pace of the compatible effects.
This is essential for the live use.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step in the future!
But it's what others saw.
Is there any possibility to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you continue to help me?
And the commode?
Do we receive another update for the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, they've already been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it's not possible, I would be satisfied with a leave or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only more than 1,000 euros for goods I don't need are a lot then.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the planned hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been rewarded
Is there a premium customer status at you?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
The negotiations on the revival of the International Atomic Energy Agreement are progressing according to Iranian information.
"The two sides are about to agree on the topics that should be on the agenda," said Iran's head-of-handler Ali Bagheri on Sunday the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first, it has not even ruled unity on the subjects to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, Vienna's discussions on the revival of the agreement continued after nearly one week interruption.
The negotiation takes part in the negotiations between Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now with the highest corona incidence
Thüringen has dissolved Saxony and currently has the highest incidence throughout the country.
As the only state, the value is above the 1000 brand.
The only state of Thuringia was on Sunday over the brand of 1000 at the Corona incidence.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100.000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which last had always been the highest incidence in Germany, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly reduced, but was also above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2-virus and 16 other deaths related to infection were reported within one day.
200 severely in Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday.
Report delays can occur during weekends.
In addition, health offices have been overloaded for weeks and hardly come back with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is only done at the beginning of March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print this out and stick to the package and put it on the mail, that's it, wasn't it?
here I don't have to click/end/fill anything?
That's exactly what I want to avoid. That's why I'm writing you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro Return fee is a freaky in my view.
It's time for changes
##MMBund's day is welcomed to me, I am U/StratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#What's the post here for?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBund's day, you can find one thing: it is not extinct.
We came into a winter star and expanded the summer hole to a few months.
#Where's the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
Most of this should simply be related to dissatisfaction, how some things have expired here and how we are in general.
In the last days, the impression has increased that many here really have bock on the MBund's day.
#What we need to change
At this point, the Community is asked around the MBunds' Day which it wants to keep alive.
The incidence came from e/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in the last days and has, simply said, found one shear-caps.
After a few writings, several people from the Community have found themselves who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to expressly urge everyone to participate, only so this project can exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ourselves, as well as work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the MBund's day work in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / modified / removed?
* How are we to appear outside in the future?
* How are new members to be promoted?
* How do we create a fair choice system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but what's not bad, for that we've got the discord at the end.
If you have a desire and time, come on the discord, work with and let us decide democraticly about the future.
I ordered a lamp screen with you that's still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/bodied for it and not suited for my taste.
I have already ordered a different hanging with you for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, are there those also in oversize, for example in 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet will be picked up temporarily.
And I'm asking you to make that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will unmount the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this can work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to agree with a pick-up date.
Is there a instruction for assembly?
How long do I have time to get them or decide to send them back?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I liked.
She has lived vegetarian for a while, probably eating meat very rarely.
I myself was a few years ago also a vegetarian.
On the question whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned interim step, I have answered honestly without much to think.
And that I thought for a long time that I would support the animal welfare as a vegetarian, but at some point reflected and understood that I finally supported animal torture.
So to become my decision vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression that her side was mistreated, she then defended vegetarianism and meant to know where her flesh came from and to reduce as a vegetarian animal dress.
Now I wonder if my answer to 'plump' was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that as a vegan one you quickly get into a corner and come up conflicts without that one would put it on it.
It greets a harmoniously loving vegan (;
It is not a clear exception in accordance with § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not exclude from the legal requirements for distance.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# does not pick up my return on site.
Since I can't be on site because of a funeral, this cannot be changed.
Please, a alternative pick-up date can be assigned to me.
From the 01.02.#NUMBER#, I'm always coming back.
Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasserrettung ausgerüstet: 45,000 Euros Subsidy from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Pälzische Innenminister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus submitted a grant decision of 45,000 euros for the new equipment car Water saving of the volunteer fire force Lahnstein to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle used since November 2020 amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this regard," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte.
The device car is used by the diverstaffel Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice saving as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there are permanently rising uses: The tree of the hotelship on Rhine and Mosel as well as the rising use of the Lahn as a leisure flow contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could read only 10% and then the problems began.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, have synchronized, removed and the app reloaded NOTS has worked.
I'm a bit frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and now hopes for help.
Okay, that's right.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

For the first time thank you for putting the whole thing here, I've spent almost a decade in the public service in a similar activity, we say we were also armsmen in the executive, I don't want to go on it!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that, of course, the government servant is more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should actually be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the special uniform and arms carriers, people to the right of conservative magic should also be clear that these people are of course difficult to deal with the living reality, of course, because you have, of course, beside the average white, now many Germans with migration background, women and also homosexuals (and so I do not mean the exaggerated feminine cliché sculptures now, because they are in the executive rather less to nothing but very normal men and women to whom you don't notice it if they don't tell it) and also on these people can and I have to leave, because in doubt they will save you your life or put it on your part.
But even these marginal groups, even if it sounds funny for the first time, my experience is conservative, are proud of Germany and feels rather less absorbed by exaggerated left policy, even though this policy seems to be working for them or thinks it must make them right, they simply want to be treated very normally.
Back to the right, since police and troops are, of course, also a cross-section of society, you will find extreme rights there, but they can openly say their opinion there or even openly forge any state-rising plans is medial completely exaggerated and angry me too.
Of course, even police and soldiers who were often abroad have often started to pause due to negative experiences, and even things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It is also likely that right mindmates will meet with a regeneous exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, such a thing is well fought and also counteracted with political education and information!
Germany is so much internationally tricked and that is also good in my opinion that we couldn't afford to have right racists and Nazis in our series at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
it has been confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I've been chatting with #NAME# before.
Alternatively, you could still deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in black to Germany or this basket is available anywhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the edge of the wood are two deep candles filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
Hello, I (w32)'ve been doing one thing for a while.
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little leisure), but for my life, I get it more bad than right to keep my budget clean and proper.
There are always phases in which everything remains, and then and when it packs me and I'm rooming and cleaning.
But it's never that 'a person could come to a spontaneous visit'.
My husband isn't better, even though it disturbs me somewhere but usually it simply loses households against work and unlust.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you been able to get more neat with child?
We haven't done anything yet, but we've been working on it, and this question has been addressing me for a long time.
Because for me I don't have a stimulus, it just doesn't disturb me so much as long as no visit comes and e.g. there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger stimulus with a child or remain sloppy?
I'm looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus enables almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further shape on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knees)

The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially in the case of deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with an uncertain personality disorder?
I have been training in the field of software development and have been trained for about one year.
Unfortunately, I find that this profession is not the right one for me, because I have been thinking about re-starting and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an uncertain (or fearless) personality disorder (EVPS).
That means roughly saying that I have no sense of self-value and is therefore shy.
I don't have a problem talking to people at a real level, but I find it very difficult to talk loosely and I have been told more often that I'm inconvenient (where I think I've been getting better).
Can I become social workers?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, in the advisory service or family assistance.
But I do not know if the specific working everyday is really the way I imagine it, and it is difficult to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it takes me down every time there is something to do with my code ("because of the simplest things again") and it is difficult to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know myself how it is going"/"I keep him away from work with my stupid questions"/"the one really must think me is inferior" etc.).
The problems I will probably have in every profession but I wanted to have mentioned it in the place.
But have you retained the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for this too.
I'm waiting for a date for collection
What do they mean to give back !
If I have downloaded a book to the #PRS_ORG#, the message your #PRS_ORG# does not authorize this book
Are there problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my cabinet.
The protein (protein) incorporated with the feed divides the bird into the individual protein materials (amino acids) in its stomach-darm tract and rebuilds its own protein substances, which it also needs for the formation of feathers.
The feather formation of the nestling and feather rebuilding of the mausering bird are extremely complex processes and a particularly high demand for the animal’s overall organism.
Please note that NECTON bio should not be administered during breeding, as otherwise it may occur to bruttab disorders.
Following this curative administration of NEKTON bio, it should be re-engaged to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multi-vitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral material preparation).

1 g NECTON bio on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft feed.
It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/milk food as the bird consumes daily and to switch water/feed daily.
A stripped spoon (inside) corresponds to 1 g of NECTON bio.
In severe feather damage, the double or three-fold dose of NECTON-Bio may be given at the beginning until the retraining approach is visible.
The normal dose is then reached until the feather retraining is complete.
Storage: NEKTON bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please apologize, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair be broken after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That's really bad service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to tell you that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement by a community employee in opposition to the Statute
Hello r/RechtsadviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A whalenut tree is to be liked on our property.
So claims made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and thus the whalenuts are not part of the statute.
In the statute, however, the whalenuts are explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the staff's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand that.
Then we will use them new packaging for this.
I haven't received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a surgery or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think that only the question is whether I can pay in euros and let me deliver the blanket to Germany
Can you check that?
Eil Release: Severe traffic accident at Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on St 2179 between Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the press alarm of the police is currently communicating (14:03 o'clock), a car has come into counter traffic when it is picked up.
There are injuries.
I'm okay.
Well, then thank you again that it was so easy!
Council and ideas on further professional life
Welcome Christmas to you for the first time!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just contemplating everything you can think about.
Before I get out here .. shortly: I need advice and best of people who know my situation somehow - so of you.
I'm just making the Ref as a cross-country climber.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I do not call anything more precisely).
The whole thing was too boring to me then, and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
At some point I landed at the Teaching Office and was sure that it is - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I've now arrived at the third "I google other job invitations".
And it's only half a year.
During the paintings before, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, after that, I can still turn around.
But I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little free time for the last month that I'm totally out of here.
Now there are holidays, but there's still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref, I always thought I was stressful, but my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday evening my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work was no matter at the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress to me.
And then there are these rigid structures that nerve me in addition.
Basically it makes fun and from outside view, the Ref also runs well as regards feedback and so on.
But I'm totally outraged and wonder how much stress my body holds before he gets completely closed - if he doesn't do that right now.
I wonder if I would like to have that for the rest of the working life like that - especially if I read some contributions from you here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, since where I was appreciated, I could take free time if I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, but it was adequately paid for it and together in a team that worked and not as a single fighter like that is now the most time the case.
But then I wonder if I haven't arrived in the same place in a year as now and have been uncontented.
You know, it's all kinds of rough, but maybe you have as foreign advice or ideas how I get out of this situation that I'm completely finished and almost begin to cry at the smallest thought of it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for the first time.
Thank you for reading and apologizing for the female undertone of me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series of VOX has progressively developed, which has led, for example, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" scene which perfectly reflects the behaviour of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we introduce a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest of the technology in matters of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amps, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain, of course, the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because these simply get better the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this clever circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances spray only so.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX you can even correct and reverse historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
She has, of course, been refined several times since, in order to meet newly added sound requirements, which led again to the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010, with more dynamics and numerous and decisive enhanced amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists are looking for a maximum sound variety here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, a nuancated play dynamic and string attack, as well as a quick talk.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers have discovered that the final stage especially determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor circulation of each VT+ amplifier with a 12AX7 tube perfectly deforms the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The defeat series of Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - for victory against the Los Angeles Clippers it is not enough.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven counters of his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main case is also adaptable: with three individual placeier and foldable closure participants, it is fully addressed according to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any kind of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflect cameras.
What finally fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an installed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for further lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Serie) can use the backpack for its equipment and for photo-fremd things.
The Everyday Backpack 20L also offers drone pilots an optimal choice because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan outbreak on La Palma: probably longest history
In the nearly three months since the outbreak of the Lava rivers have caused great damage on the Canary Island.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days now, the volcano outbreak on La Palma has been the longest in the well-known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the outbreak of the volcano of Tehuya in 1585 was the longest on the Atlantic Island in front of the western coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous eruptions.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but volcanoologists continued to dare no forecast when he could end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
damages in millions of heights
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degrees hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 housings and other buildings, as RTVE reported.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a metre thick lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
In front of the coast, two new landings with a size of about 50 hectares were created by cold lava.
Heavily affected was the enormous banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 80 000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and who had been in the crisis before the volcano outbreak.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further areas were severely affected, wrote the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas stands at the door, and especially the children will hardly be able to expect the celebration of heaven.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the thrilling tension something seduced in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that keep our increasingly divided society together.
The more important is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of donation, so that the gestures of donation, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-founding "social agreement of natural peoples", which can escape starry routine and be refilled with life in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christian child
Strongly, it was the Protestants, through which Christmas days were closely linked to the gift.
Previously, on the Nikolaus Day, gifts were transferred to some kind.
The background of this still popular habit is that the Holy Nikolaus as Bishop of Myra has thrown three women secretly gold into their windows in one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of donation, the popular custom in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially the children.
Protestants found themselves in this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and human beings as "saint worship".
For these reasons, they are defending themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christian child from the Nikolaus and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the donor moved on the sanctuary evening.
However, since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely, it is only the least disturbing that the use of Saint Nikolaus is similar to the use of Martinssingen and Martinssing is still a solid part of the pre-fetching time.
Today you will find in boots in front of the door and under the Christmas tree from socks to desired luxury watches everything that the heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources have proved a tradition of gift since the 13th century on the day of St. Nikolaus.
With the Reformation, the day of donation disappeared on Holy Evening.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful cuddle on the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind appears on the Holy Evening or the Christmas man, which is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, which has been assigned some types of ownership.
This includes, for example, his white bart, which still has little common with the rather strict assyrer beard of the historical figure, his sleeve drawn from retirement and the preferential of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, the Holy Nikolaus remains the central figure at the Christmas Festival.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana, who should have guided them to the son of Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes fable creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought fathers frost to some glory.
Here's not pensioners, but three horses who, as Troika, pull his sleeves.
In the Czech Republic, the native of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for the handling of the gifts.

Police shoots suspected bank robbers near the king's palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police told us that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookmaker's business.
The man, according to the authorities, fled in a vehicle that could be stopped by officials a little later.
It had fallen shots and the man had been hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime site.
The police did not go out of a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into each beet, garden area or steering.
The light is simply set up and can be anchored with 2 ground plows in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charge of the built-in battery.
Lighting time max. 10 h.
- The robust plastic output can be used all year round in the outside area.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from remote galaxies that illuminate indoor color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is quite harmless: the sun alone ensures that this solar light is fascinating – optionally in white or coloured light (in equal to six different colours).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally shaped large gravel, this modern lighting object presents itself at day.
Its organic rounds fit into any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone beet.
Well, he also makes himself in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and finders, where he knows to claim thanks to his size.
Great preworks can be saved: As a solar light, »Smart Stone« does not require pipeline or batteries.
Set the "lightstone" at any place that is shaking from the sun.
Two provided ground sprays ensure a steady stop if needed.
The matt white plastic shell itself is robust and weather-resistant.
His solar module hides »Smart Stone« discreetly in its interior, together with its battery and two LEDs – one for white, the other for coloured light.
The battery is already charged when sunlight falls to the housing.
In the event of inbreaking dawns, »Smart Stone« starts to shine independently; in which color you determine this yourself: Six attractive light colors – next to daylight white – are available.
The deactivation is also done automatically as soon as the battery charge is dropped to a specified minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun appears again, the charging cycle starts from the front on the next day.
That's what I've done several times. It doesn't work.
Shame, I would like to continue with you, but if the voucher isn't counted on me, I will not be ordered on principle.
If you don't think about it, please let me know.

Pillen Problem
Hello, dear women's people,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, is after a year reddit actually my first post.
To my problem: I've been renegotiating the pill about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again because I have to take enough medication that I can't choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pains, but my skin.
During my last two-year break, I had received from 0 to 100 explosion-like pupils and these everywhere.
As far as superficial, but I was very stressed and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of break, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Maybe anyone has any tips to avoid this once.
Perfume-free and without shit, my cosmetics are already, but maybe it's what someone can recommend to me.
Female physician hasn't taken me so seriously and Hautarzt's date is still coming.
Many love thanks to every one who read through the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Hated pre-bupertary bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-floor sweaters and the acne theme.
I have also tried all possible nutrition in the course of chr. disease and have been hanged on no sugar, milk and meat-arm mixed food, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that hormone is just the worm in it, but if you like me everywhere you want to stop looking for what else is going wrong.
I already had all her colleague semina o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern.
I always have to work on the phone in the meantime and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to test if the money was there, I would have seen it
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.

110-kV earth cable is rebuilt 2022
Approval for the relocation of the new high voltage cable with Tann is legal.
The plan decision of the government of Niederbayern opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was now communicated to the Bayernwerk network operator.
The around seven kilometres long earth cable will connect Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt direction between Simbach and parish churches.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning at Reut to a mast of the free pipe.

Ref: curriculum planning (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the Ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I still have big problems to plan my education in the field of artisan.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the tablet, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In the school, I can also only copy s/w freely (what's nervt for doctrine).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making the topic of geofactors and with me actually stands every hour for itself.
In principle, the methods also repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest excessively much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs etc.).
When planning, I am always going from learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it (mostly I create a workheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
This is why the worksheets are also available.
Maybe I am able to have an artisan how to work with the book time efficiently.
I'd be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
In fact, I have already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG#, however, I would like to make the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation on Christmas business.
In most shops, only who is vaccinated or healed is allowed.
Trade considers this unnecessary and complains sales breakdowns.
A possible solution he also has parat.
The 2G schemes corrupt the important Christmas business from the point of view of the German Trade Association (HDE).
In the case of transactions with non-day needs, sales infringements should be complained, criticized HDE business leader Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written down the Christmas business.
"What actually should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without ground," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions, therefore, lost nearly one third of their pre-crisis turnovers during the expiry week.
It only runs well in the food retail and in the online sector.
The Association demanded consequences from dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the main business leader.
"2G does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
Current regulations shook off customers and required high personnel.
The volume scheme had to be approved all over the country, he asked.
After that, every customer should only be controlled to 2G (vaccinated or healed) and would have access to all businesses with the volume received on that day.
In addition, in retail trade, as in public transport, the 3G rules (impfed, healed or tested) should be sufficient to carry out sample checks.
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, specialized in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
Lastly, the frequencies were almost 75 percent of the pre-corona level without 2G, and the turnover was approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high human and administrative effort, the Center is attempted to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called volume solution, where "for example, visitors can enter all shops in a central location in the center once and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - uninterrupted". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been tried to be cast with a yellow filler.
That looks stupid.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and sticked it.
How do I have to go on for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor provides exceptional possibilities for setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K manually.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is easy and intuitive.
The lamp produces a very light current with soft light of high quality, completely flimmerless.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the colour temperature.
It is a great tool to work on the filmset or in the studio.
The optionally available DMX512 controller allows the remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in difficultly accessible places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of keys and a bright display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the range of delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage spaces, simply pressing one of the memory keys and finishes.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when switching off, so that the known situation is re-established when newly switched - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is adjusted to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of operating with favourable NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can use existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also verify before the set that the batteries have sufficient performance - it is a battery tester equal with installed - for each of the two batteries a value in the two displays (the upper left battery display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlamp over the supplied power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm shell as a connection for fixing, so you can directly access your phototative.
The inclination must be reliably adjusted on both sides by means of firms.
It was observed that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a necklace is included in the scope of delivery.
Great is that in the scope of delivery is also included a pocket.
So you can safely transport or store the light with all the accessories you might still want to buy without problems.
Shame that I have received and she is too small:(
"Party we wanted to beat": Frankfurt celebrates torrich comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction of Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in series of victoryless Hessen were supposedly on the way to the next Bundesliga pilot.
But then the SGE turned up, shot the frustration of a growing seasonal start of the soul within a good hour and victoryed furos with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," exclaimed Trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and spoke a "Pauschal-Lob, to every one who was with."
At the beginning, it looked like a new vapor for the Frankfurter who was now in position for nine still behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with 2:0.
What happened then impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am madly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Also defense player Christopher Lenz, who had been able to stand on place for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overwhelmed muscle injury, stressed the morality of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old and was pleased with a view to the result especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to beat today.
But now Glasner wants to keep the focus for the coming tasks, but it also looks well for the staff situation.
It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to "continue step by step and remain modest" and to "pass through this level" the tasks until the year's change.
Next, on Wednesday, in the course of the English week, there is an outward game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you because of a mistake of mine.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and let it redirect, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or should I wait until the money is transferred back and resign the order?
I am sorry to say that I will not be ordered again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have they ever been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damping for handball women in front of quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's handball women slipped after humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views from the parquet.
The DHB selection at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers collected a defeat and must now run against host Spain in the quarter finale.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," judged Bundestrainer Henk Grüner.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany concluded the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danish (10:0).
It's bad that we couldn't take the flood.
That was a bad game of all that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the half-final, a significant increase must be made against the World Cup Twelve of 2019 on the next Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal alive since 2007.
The best German advertiser in the Duell with the three-fold Olympician Denmark was backroom player Alina Greyeels with six gates.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," recreational player Xenia Smits said, "We have to look forward now."
Not from front to back at height
Unlike the previous five tournament games, the German team with the pin was not high.
False and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a fast 0:4 return rate after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse things with some parades.
The first gate reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Greyeels successfully finished a quick counterpart.
However, the expected initial inflammation was not.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly sit in the scene - and if so, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the party ran early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially as the backroom player Mia Zschocke saw red a little later because of a hard foul on her counterplayer.
In the quarter's finale, however, it may be re-employed.
Only in the final phase of the first half-time, the DHB selection got a little better into play and until the break came to at least five gates.
The only quiet hope for a recovery after the change was already after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Green Protectors sinned in all areas and made it easy to the well-founded opponent, who is one of the medal candidates at the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to raise up to an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the parquet.

Are they doing this?
The title exists, I am active as a vaccine in mobile vaccine teams where (to date only) the bioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon largely finished, there is partly going on in vaccination centres for me.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, if they are not related to a personal (e.g. "I take medication X, that is tolerating with vaccination.").
In my field of task, the information for vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to vaccination according to coronaimphe regulation and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (mean never happen).
The vaccination itself is delegable to qualified staff, e.g. medical staff.
In vaccine teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, but they cannot (may be vaccinated?), so that I also carry out most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What, please, is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent by an amberger, the BR TV "We in Bavaria" has been given for intense reflection.
Unlike many previous days, however, the term in the series "Host mi?" remained unprecedented by the callers this time.
No, it wasn't a "human who's nervous".
And no one, "then has to go fast".
That, the people heard of the TV moderator, was totally wrong.
What the man from Amberg told the solution and thus probably also provided surprises for many upper pillars.
"The Huidler," the spectators learned, "is a lap with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed as an expert from the Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical obesitarian term, derived somehow from the rather well-known mouth-type word "Houders".
With which a gap of education was closed - probably also in many who have lived for a long time in the Amberg area.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always comes: opens - someting went wrong - try again later.
I started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, rebooted, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired.
Nothing has helped.
tyre selection at the racing wheel really so secure?
This morning I was waking up full of action because I wanted to train at least a little for the preparation of my bicycle tour in the next week.
Said, done and I drove my race wheel, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what happened in every city of town (this time: Thanks to Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the track.
Zack, loud cushion and my rear tyre wanted no more to join the rest of the route.
Since I had no real opportunity to get a replacement robe and a replacement hose because of the week day, I had to turn around with half a bit of a bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn't so bad, but maybe it's better if I practice this with the tyre change before the cycling tour.
But now I face a question and hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long route over several days before me, I would get very unpleasant about this problem more often.
Now it was not bad because the old tyres of the pre-owner (very nice old man, on the day I came to pick up the bike down until 14 o'clock 120km!) and who had already described them as suboptimal because he had been rolling with them for several years.
But if I think I have to change tyres after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really poorly laughed :D
Now I came to the conversation with an older man at the highway, who wondered why I didn't have the marathon Plus tyres; they should be unplated.
Now, of course, it sounds very tempting.
But are these really so incapable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/ripes now, just to be disappointed.
Further, I wonder: I've got on the racing wheel right now, I think 25x622.
They are also available (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you guess to other tyres in a racing bike?
The swallow side seems to be my absolute! Laie knowing rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!

On the B57, the 53-year-old was poured between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car from unexplained cause against a Mid-Island and then moved to the counterway, as the police told.
There was a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then pushed against a tree and the man was stuck in the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old companion were severely injured in the accident and brought to nearby hospitals.

After the release of our new High End Breitband B 100- 6 OHM, it was only a question of time until our SOLO series would be re-entering.
SOLO 15 is the new sprayer and reminds optically the large models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this design proposal a suitable design foot is directly included to lift the speaker to the correct hearing position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
In principle, SOLO 15 is very well suited for people in which the maximum volume plays a rather subordinate role but is to achieve an exceptionally high level.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to generate almost unfiltered such a large sound pressure level.
But that does not mean that SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears considerably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
Tonal was voted with a light high-tone increase.
This is commonly used in broadbands to optimize the too high frequencies with a strong increase in bonding.
The SOLO 15 convinces with very clear and fine sound exactly on the hearing place.
Lightly rotated outside, the high-tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image warmer designed.
Thanks to the point-sound source, the positioning of the individual components of a musical piece in the optimum stereo-rear angle is sharp and surprisingly precise.
The reference suspicious extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM ensure an enemyynamics that seeks its same.
The SOLO 15 complements not only our SOLO series, but expands it in terms of resolution and battery.
As with all our sets it is advisable at the beginning to consider the final optics of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in the construction.
For example, if you want to furnate the case, the lowering of the speaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the furnier resumes material.
After all plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill a 8 mm hole into the ground plate at the appropriate place to be able to perform the cable easily there later.
With the help of a upper millet, the speaker opens in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used alignly later.
On the back, this opening should be fitted with a 45° fiber to make the opening surface of the speaker chassis as large as possible inside.
The four screwing points of the B 100 - 6 OHM are being interrupted in the fiber, as shown in the picture 'Detail Phase'.
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface ahead of yourself.
On these, the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor will now be put on.
The three stiffs should also be used and adhesive.
The stiffs themselves may vary in the material strength if needed, for example, if you want to use finished performance from the construction market instead of making it yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page is applied.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circular saw or a forest driller, the application of the bass reflex tube as well as the connecting terminal on the back wall is facilitated.
Afterwards you use a round miller to round all the edges of the actual box.
The upper side of the footplate can also be rounded off.
Afterwards the foot plate is stuck firmly with the foot of the housing and also screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the recording and drilling (2.5-mm driller) of the screwing points of the speaker chassis and the connector terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wooden dust (suctions / blow out), one starts moving the cable.
The simplest results from the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
The entire and uncoupled cable is pushed piece for piece by the 8 mm drilling in the foot to the terminal opening and leaves it there approx. 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and it also loosely hangs out there.
The frequency waves are prepared and used below.
The construction plan of the frequency softness and the corresponding connector plan can be taken from the following document: Installation instructions soft solo 15.
If the frequency soft is installed and the connector terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening within the box, which is not yet completely closed.
By the 35 mm BASSIFLEX opening and with a bit of skill, you can drop hot stickers on the opening and thus close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can verify the seal accordingly.
Now the defeat follows according to description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be triggered at the Pluspole of the speaker (great contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is reduced and inserted to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube).
For defeat, a matt of the dampening material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I give up a order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
> Hello to everyone,
> Finally we can announce that we will also organize the OSCAST again this year!
> For known reasons, it is unfortunately not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people by switch, so we will track the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid our delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start at about 0:30.
Make drinks cold, plan good food and make you ready for a long but very interesting night.
