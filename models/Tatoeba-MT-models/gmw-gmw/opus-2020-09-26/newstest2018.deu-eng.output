Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An idiot site where young people are supposed to meet today.
A call chapel, where it is now digged for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Kleingärtners manage the former reason of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories at day.
It's nervous when maps are not up-to-date.
This is known by everyone who had to get up, because the car-navi represented a green meadow instead of a hiding road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas, a offer of the Bavaria Geoportal of the State Government, are all other than the current – but that is why it is very clear.
Especially when you compare them with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century.
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a flickenteppich that is not identifiable as such.
For cities and communities, more detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were prepared in the large map.
These originated according to the Bavarian measurement administration between 1810 and 1864 and came from the first measurement of Bayerns.
Your contractor: Napoleon.
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and ordered a topographical recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Even though the French troops finally deducted with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, they were today's neighbors who created the idea of an area-decking Bavarian card.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographical Bureau" - and hence the Bavarian Measurement Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich comes from 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek, like all others.
The comparison is the most impressive of the country's capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was formed 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, when Münchner District was united.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings focus around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, one sees nothing but fields - at the first glance: When zooming, a smaller map with dizzy lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered corridors from the so-called "surcharge" from which the basic tax was derived.
Small parcels no longer show farmers there - but clown gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area is located north of Subsendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 of the October festival, was actually a meadow in the 19th century and was not a concrete desert.
On the other hand, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original leaflet, in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district, you will not only read the street name "am Gasteig" or the elevation "on the ventilations" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, people were once shut up with madness.
There was the Munich Circle Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüfteen" in 1858/59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist which is associated with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of so-called errors.
He has also forbidden the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has worked for an exhibition with the site.
For 280 patients, the place was initially occupied, later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circulatory institution in hair in 1905.
Since 2006 there is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatris.
At the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people are now met in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies.
West is the football square of TSV Munich East, eastern residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built in architectural revelation to the origin of the male institution, which had been destroyed during World War II in bombing attacks.
The Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as the "Hauptplatz", the Kaufingerstraße called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies cracked many holes into the city in December 1944.
A great thing remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a middle-aged gravel were once at the Marienhof, where the pre-works and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich took place for the second S-Bahn stamp line.
With the slider, you can compare the old Munich card with the air image of today - and fill the hole on the Mariehof.
Citizens' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored has issued a warning to colourful people traveling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will enter into force until 28 August 2017, invites Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travel by the State and to take extreme caution, since a number of questionable racial-based incidents have recently occurred and are noted here in the entire state," says the Group's opinion.
A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it difficult for people to gain discrimination complaints, as well as the state's criminal enforcement authorities, which are unproportionately targeted for minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have infringements of civil rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten together or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a State in the United States.
The group quoted incidents such as racist offence against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the journey by the state and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of any crime.
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General Prosecutor of Missouri, showing that black drivers in the state are more than 75 percent frequently encouraged than white.
"The recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen to Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be ready to bring bail or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."
In 2015, Missouri recorded 100 hatred crimes, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hatred crime report programme, which rank the state as regards the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.
The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had adopted immigration laws to commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration infringements, which, according to ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the USA.
Weidezaun project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the next year.
The CDU-Bundestagsabonnements Peter White and Kordula Kovac have made a picture on site.
At the courtyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Ortsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his business, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 milk cows and also many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
The Black Forest Milk is for him the alternatively unmarketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
On the table of the guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach, he referred to the Weidezaun project as "elementary important".
I can't manage in such steep areas profitably.
The greenland area ensures a lot of work, many things need to be processed with the motor scissors.
"We have to fight with the conditions and topography here," stressed Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not operate biologically.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The community has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about the Leader funding."
Farmers should be supported at the cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare.
It is hoped that this could lead to a long way of exploration of the areas.
"The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often in criticism because of the promotion
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were gathered over the cereal promotion.
The area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be refored until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded over Leaders, one fourth the municipality of Fischerbach wore.
Thus, farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the cinnamon," said Schwendemann.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You're doing a really good job, without farmers and farmers it's not going."
Peter White also stated: "The best food is produced here."
The Landscape Care Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state support for pastures.
The aim is to keep the black forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a promotional scene referred to by the LPR.
In addition, the incinerating area must not be slipper-efficient (having more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the exploration.
For the 2018 Weidezaun project Fischerbach, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels is currently running that want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.
The opening area is 35 hectares, and the calculated cost is more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes on the Statue of Freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - therefore, the carefully-sensitive Saddam Husseins trap at Firdos Platz in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a hot dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals on the drastic restriction of legal immigration to the statue of freedom.
To remain fair, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitaters would have lined him if he did.
But he attacked its significance, and in particular the significance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
When Miller Acosta mocked: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom."
Miller is really right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance of the upset words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tires, your poor, / your distressed masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the distressing waste of your rich coasts."
There's never been a time when the "leading waste" on our screens was better to see.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump's USA are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lasarus - and her friends who used to place their words on the base after her death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a depleted classical figure.
Lazarus changed this significance: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.
And she gives herself a different name: Mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativeism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The large Schreihals Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom would not invite anyone, but rather be an early Neoconservative that brings the American flame into the night-round world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.
It is to bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
Limbaugh's got something very unusual here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as it was seen by the exhausted, angry, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge, and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they need to hear.
And of course that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize.
Their torch shall not light the way, but the hatred which is its only source of power shall be illuminated.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scotlands belonged to the British team
The United Kingdom's Leichtathletic Performance Director, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish quota in the World Championship Framework "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "in Scotland something special developed" and the United Kingdom's light athletics must learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it out," said Black.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.
British light athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal lawyers, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will take place against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was elected from the team to team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great."
The commonwealth-silber medal winner, who will join the 400-m championships at her fifth world championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scotlands are in the British team.
Schottland was the best number of athletes in the world championship in 1983 and 2015.
The Mid-Track Runner Muir runs this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shoot that one should observe after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shoot was in the Lee McConnell team.
The team captain says that she is "norm proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special feature of being team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and chose me, it makes it a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scotlands that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get to Podien.
What about my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking Criters about Facebook: Do not engage in a public office if you cannot tolerate the heating of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers struck him for everything, from internal policy to political principles.
He smashed the criticism, sure.
But he didn't silence his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said: "The freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led to battle like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this early this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's only Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very skilled in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect to his voters and playing his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called officially and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolley.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profan.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hatred crime.
"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hatred crimes and other current news," she wrote in the news release commentary "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call "pre-language".
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in the past, if you did the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guide articles, or to arrest demonstrators and to make them quiet.
But that's exactly what happens digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for being ridiculed of Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is accused of Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first miles in this question fell in Virginia last week.
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisor of Loudoun County violated the first amendment, according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable Porto had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers hit his leadership.
And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolles.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't silence her.
Freeness of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for local comfort in the next three days, since the Renaissance Club in East Lothian organises the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led to the left in the Archerfield last year before he lost against Paul Eales, is connected to the new place of exhibition and acts as tournaments on behalf of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club being built, and we see how he reaches his glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry made a great job when he decided this place.
He is a zealous defender of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great show window for this course."
The English eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he won both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That really feels special," said the Southport player.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Come back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the home floor action.
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do it well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I am glad about how it has been done."
With the Trio on the field, the former master winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are the first.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance belong to the six Schotts on the field, the other are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with an inmate and £ 10 per car with two or more inmates.

Less pneumonia by Passive Smoking
Over the past two decades, more and more people have died from pulmonary cancer because of passive smoking.
This result is found in a study by scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"At our estimates, 167 pneumonia is due to passive smoking per year," said study director Heiko Becher.
In comparison, he studied his own study on this subject in 1994.
At that time there were 400 pneumonia cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study was published in the "International Journal of Public Health".
House connections prove to be very complex
The buildings in the Villinger Street are in full Gange and "lying somewhat in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than presumed, as much is hidden underground, which is not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders construction work, is a major problem for the company's construction force.
"The ignorance of the drivers from red traffickers and lockers is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road was locked and only the line buses were entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days have been very hard.
But fortunately, we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She even rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regime in the disturbing Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually lays a sweet potato - locally called "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the chopped garlic is extracted and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, e.g. to wash clothes with dry water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, late work can be dangerous: most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around in the village after 7:00," she says.
It is a rare insight into the daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders should vote by a public hand survey before the crew forces.
An existing movement that triggered independence against the Dutch government quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it isöde. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive by car in the morning.
There is no public transport.
The city with some 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo tines, and of wave sheet roofs transformed by rust into various yellow-brown tones.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journey here, not to be journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans honored a God named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not used to wearing this clothing," Degei says and points to their vibrant, hand-woven turban, their dark shirt and their bright rock.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live under the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetization rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's goldland.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport decreased gold and copper at the value of 3.1 billion US dollars.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth estimated $78 billion.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military preserves an embarrassing presence.
A 2005 New York Times study reported that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military members and units, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goats and are treated gracelessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's highland in the 1970s became the genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We are going to lose everything" says a 2016 Aarts Diocese Brisbane report, in which reports on the abominations of the previous year are included, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrical attacks are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have increased as Papua's resources bring a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the population-rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese maintenance cantines sell fried chicken and Gado-Gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables cheaper on the traditional market than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old paniai native who moved to the capital of Jayapura.
"It cost the native Papua - the mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known in the Volksmund as Jokowi, promised to address the inequality and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former roomman secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," says You.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point in October only two months after Jokowis initiation.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs before a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The scared children told them that they should switch on their headlamps.
One of the soldiers took an attack on her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and struck the group with their guns, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was burned and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football square in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and introduced the Waita dance - running in the circle and impressing a bird singing - by Papua's Mee Pago dam.
Some demonstrators began sliding stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, a command was sent to the soldiers via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says a official document by TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto-Viertel of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called to rest and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says that the ball came from the rows of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was it," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only bears a name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua Police, Yotje Mende, said Reporters that his officers just wanted to "safe" their station because they were attacked.
"We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said the spokesman of the Papua Police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured.
The news about the killings came 'filtered' to Jakarta the next day.
In Jayapura, Jokowi gave a passionate speech three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to address the historical misconducts in Papua.
"I want this case to be solved immediately, so it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Wiranto said that he set up an extra-judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 90s and the beginning of the 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to address these infringements, but there are processes that must be carried out," he said.
Then Wiranto took a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on June 5 in Jakarta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Weanto, accused by the UN of "criminal crimes against humanity", who claimed more than 1,000 victims of death in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been filed in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai saints accepted such claims with gross infidelity.
"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there was no progress," says Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military is afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a building company who refused to bring a conscious man to the hospital, one person died, and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man who had drunk 24-year-old Ravianus Douw in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital.
Rough villagers protested before the company's location office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning fires.
But locals say that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting on the crowd and killing one.
"We were so paniced, we are afraid that there will be revenge," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured people were quickly delivered here, says the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament called on the officers involved to take account of and withdraw the police's mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai was always an unresting herd for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribe members of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highland of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army who claimed to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested and arbitraryly conferred in Paniai, under the pretext of the "Security of National Sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua is Paniai known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Brot is just as out of range.
The people here build everything they eat: especially note and fruit and leaf vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They retain most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants, which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better trained and richer migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary capabilities to lead its own companies competitively.
"Young people are not interested in staying in the village... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on the reporting of international media remain stressed.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although rare permission was given to film.
According to Phelim Kine, deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis’s election struggle to remove the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's most distressing eastern provinces of Papua and West Papoea: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "diversified and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Arrmanata Nasir rejected the allegations of the group and said to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to suppress the evidence of human rights cases."
On-site people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the Embassy of Human Rights Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on 4 May, the locals broke their silence and impressed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also took part in the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua says that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a rubbish military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, view their voice for Yokowi as a "debt" he has to pay back.
"You don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidations, families of the Paniai victims carried out a last symbolic act of despite: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to justice, but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus with reduced head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time
A fire was found on Friday in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meters high, 79-story buildings.
It is the second fire that fought through the highhouse in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up in the fire alarm and crying people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," told a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting at 4 p.m. local time (00.00 p.m. GMT) extinguished the fire and cooled the building.
The government said that it was working on the provision of accommodation for the affected.
The incident can revival questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of highhouses around the world.
A study carried out by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages came from the clothing, the external clothing for decoration or isolation.
In the UK, the police said that they believe that the system of records for insulation and decoration at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire with about 80 people dying.
No Davis Cup reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has passed with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single only on two profit rates was not supported by the necessary two-third majority.
The five-sat classics, although often very long, are also very esteemed, are thus preserved to the traditional application.
63.54 percent of the Member States voted for the reform, so the objective of ITF President David Haggerty was scarcely missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member states have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," said Haggerty.
One will continue to work to improve the application.
Not even to vote, after many objections, the proposal had already been made to carry out the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: In this way, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the following year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements for training places etc. are facilitated and the players will have to meet less official media date before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers brings forbidden items into the plane, finds a survey
A survey on flight passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of objects consciously or unconsciously prohibited at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration were smuggling, including at least 6 percent of them entering the plane, while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other objects with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they had discovered lately that they had traveled wrongly with guns, ammunition, or explosive.
The survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a Jet-Charter service, Stratos Jet Charts Inc. - also found that younger travelers are more likely to ignore the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA were 19.7 percent millennials, compared with less than 15 percent members of generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted that they had been carrying blades through safety control, while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane.
The company said that it questioned travelers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods had brought through airport security and how many had deliberately done it.
It is no surprise that the people who wear the highest smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowing - through security were those who fly most frequently.
However, the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain what liquids they can take or how much of them.
It is therefore not surprising that the largest amount of the substances confiscated by the TSA are liquids forbidden.
For a while the people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: tens of thousands of tesla customers cancel order
Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk likes to present with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far suppressed that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on turnover increases and even more huge sales targets, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk first reported the latest quarterly balance shows another, less glossy number: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
In recent months, Musk had often acquired with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins.
Now Musk admits: 63,000 of the total 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Criters have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of an cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.
At present, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are present, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that cancellation of around 12 percent of all orders could become the problem.
Its argument: The challenge in the ambitious growth targets lies not in demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 - all models together - it should be 500,000, 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at least in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its nail new, never practically tested production roads without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if it comes to greater delays, then the incompulsoryness of the reservations to the problem for Tesla could become.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in crowds.
EPA-Chef Pruitt withdraws due to the delay of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day after he had been accused by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Authority, revoked his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama Era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-producing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of the public environmental authorities to respond more rapidly than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaint brought against his previous body in a Bundesberufungsgericht.
It is a deadline for States to comply with the 2015 standards for soil-near ozone on 1 October.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "intervening in local decisions or obstructing economic growth".
Pruitt, who was a prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental legislation.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly deployed to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.
The sudden reversal from Wednesday is the latest legal relapse for the Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration, which required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turning at ozone standards simply strengthen the EPO's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of the timely fulfilment of the new standards.
"The EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be accused of activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," said Pruitt, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that there is to us seriously."
Nevertheless, the EPO’s opinion said that Pruitt would eventually use his "authorization for lateness and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules are "based on a solid policy and the best available information".
The Republicans at the Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York prosecutor General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that had sued the EPO this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPO - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone develops when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refinery, chemistry plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people, and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths.
Representatives of the public health sector and the environmental guards cried out about Pruitt's surprising change in courses.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crossing of the Trump government to offer ourselves to environmental pollutants and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilarius Church
750 years St. Hilarius Church: Anniversary of the mountain church will be invited to the old cemetery areal in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 16.30 a.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Beneficiary Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town has made the friends and promoters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique rough jungle."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württembergian document book: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silber.
The text of the document was based on the Tumlinger Mountain, except the former parish church, also a prestigious court, to which the church or the patronate law belonged and not vice versa.
So there were people there too.
According to the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible in the village of Tumlingen, was the "Berg" of the third, the prestigious settlement center of the village.
Old cards from the time around the year 1600 undermine these historical situations.
Patronate law was based on early medieval own church law.
A master who built, equipped and occupied a church with a pastor remained owner of this church and was able to inherit this church.
This involved the right to impose a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two bargains on Christmas in 1673.
The newly purchased bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window discs were hit and the glockenseiles were stolen.
The roof was unseen.
In 1796 French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the candle and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remnants of the church threatened to crash in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead of listeners.
In 1823, the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius Church aborted.
Only the church tower was stopped.
In the New Year's night in 1834, a storm collapsed the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was canceled.
Only the tower still existed today remained witness to the 750 years old church history.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Rentners" as a successor of Dieter Dockhorn are the Hilarius plant.
As an organiser, the friends and promoters of Tumlingens invite the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to the St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, July 16.
This is formed by the Combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium of Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local chief Hartmut Romans speaks the final word.
The program starts at 16.30 p.m.
Admission is from 15.30 p.m.
A drink takes place in front of the cemetery for the slope of the Serenade.
"Good a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers show the fantastic view.
The serenade takes place only at dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historical St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumlingen and listeners.
The friends and promoters of Tumlingen feel particularly obliged to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini reaffirmed.
Association wants to have the approval of windcycles checked
"Boisheim refuses" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) has asked the Boisheim Association to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, wind power plants could not have been approved in Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in foursen, only at the border of the city of Schwalmtal had existed a wind power concentration zone.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind power plants are in principle possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
These zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier, the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved because of a form error.
Christoph Erkens, Chairman of Boisheim, said: "With the lack of planning requirements, the authorization decision granted is still illegal and therefore revoked."
Current status of things: The City Council has decided again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; an approval of the district government is still outstanding.
Recognizing: "These is hereby excluded from the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind power plants by law".
The circle confirms the input of the call.
"The corresponding letters have been received to the Foursen Circle since last week," said one speaker.
The circle takes them to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the procedure to be stopped.
In view of ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the circle did not want to express itself contently on Thursday as to the argument of the Boisheim Association.
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four per 200 meters high windcycles on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Last year, the company, in which the city of Foursen is indirectly involved, had concluded cargo contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares land.
With the construction of the four wind power plants, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households are to be covered - that is about one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four-sen households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer Foursens City Council gave green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Ösach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor collapse: Ms. dies in a terrible accident
One terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was lethal injured.
Two more people were slightly injured.
The country road stayed locked over hours.
According to police statements, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich and her car took the L 333 in the direction of Bogel, along with her 53-year-old mother.
City and dealers plan "Home Shops" Weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The Commercial Association and the City Administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the residents to the shopping bumble in the city centre.
As the Chairman of the Commercial Association, Christian König, announced, the "Home Shops" Weeker is supposed to sensitize the customers for what offers their own city provides apart from the usual supermarket goods.
Accordingly, a market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies are to present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre should be invited to the midnight shops.
The action was not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation, advertising spots in the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, Christian König.
City management and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Trade.
This means that the commercial club and the city go into another stage of the "Attractive Downtown" project.
These include new offers such as the first "activ day" to the fountain festival with sale open Sunday, conversations with all businessmen and hosts to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the refusal of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potentials are to be re-opened or re-enabled.
These include tourists and tourists.
But many indigenous people would have lost the city centre from the sight of shopping.
At the end, everyone would have to contribute to living the city centre - to landlords, the farms of the entire city and associations.
It was right to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had been partly widespread, that king had said in spring.
Birgit String, head of the IHK Centre in Mühlhausen, informed that the third day of the "Heimat-Shoppen" will take part in five towns of Thüringer.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "advertise for the appreciation of local trade and show its importance for the common welfare of our cities," says Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also made it clear that every citizen could influence his direct environment with its purchasing behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
During a gas explosion in the city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine were injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire fight, on Wednesday (local time) was another injured person in critical condition.
A man died when part of a school building crashed at the explosion.
A first loser was also saved to death later.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of calamity, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
At the holiday time, only a few people stayed in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put under pressure after transmitted transcripts of telephone calls Mexico due to the payment of the border walls
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27th, Trump invited the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him because he had publicly condemned the wall. Reportedly, he said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump launched his presidency campaign with the promise to establish a wall on the southern border of the United States and swore to allow Mexico to pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States who migrated to Australia would make him look like a "dep" after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the USA.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moores Ford massacre: activists replay racist linechact as a call for justice
An 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and pushed to the Ford bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns emerged to block his way.
The leader of the mobs - a man of medium age in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked tested through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man broke.
"Have him out of the car!"
Screams crushed the silence when a young black man was crushed by the rider's seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that was played on July 22, is just a replica.
But when a snake is thrown around the neck by "Roger", almost all of the audience sighed out very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil judges have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lined by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one was ever accused of the murders.
"It is really inconceivable that no one was arrested in all these years - although we see it in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of reproduction.
"It's a dirt spot on a story, but it's a burden for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congress member of Georgia State and a lifetime citizen.
For him, the aftermath serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want punishment, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to receive justice," he said.
"We can't come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A court physician lays a cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI acts received by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil judges say that the double motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city was always known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision by the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in the election struggle in summer.
Approximately the same time as the election, according to the FBI of the black farmhouse Roger Malcom, a white landowner, Barnett Hester, fell down during a fight - supposedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to liberate Malcom from prison, the FBI.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they got away from prison and approached the Moore's Ford Bridge, a linechmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes a FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a complaint between the state and local criminal prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and invaded the identity of witnesses."
Brooks is even more pregnant.
"It was an electoral massacre," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you can register and if you vote, this will happen to you here."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual repatriation of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their presentation is spectacular, aggressive and is based on a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that this is the point.
"We don't want to talk about the linechair because we are then confronted with its harshness in all of us," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or don't want to hear what I've been through."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the blacks - drove into a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director.
He has played the role of the head clan member for years, but he said that the role would never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, who screams Hester and angrys him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, disappear from my property!"
Rascona answers the fire.
There's a break.
And then everybody (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still kicking.
"I just don't think that white people at that time said 'a --- he'."
"But," one of the other black performers whispered.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And exactly there the energy moves in the room, a feeling of comradeship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy to get this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four killed people.
The scene starts again.
This time, Rascona says the N word, he says it sharply and with emphasis.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and fast.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed with a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and carries out Billie Holidays mourning Lobrede "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks with every second word.
Approximately a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have experienced all nearly eight hours of Georgia's humidity when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage.
Until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels funny.
When the last notes of the song sound out, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspire the body name.
Children hang on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy murmurs as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchseil and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks up in their arms crying together, the emotional load of the performance finally breaks through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
"We know that it's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
On a table a white couple from Atlanta lobsters about the aftermath with a black couple that they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that felt the performance has left behind.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and who do this because they look like you," she said.
"What really does this to me, let me believe that the linech still goes on," she added, "it's only called police shooting today."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof holds on his table, eats and reminds of citizens' rights.
He said he already started planning the performance next year.
"The aftermath is in some way inspiring, for it describes the terror of what we have endured, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's so if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat it."
"Government" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf sets on a colorful-frivole scenery before gigantic, six-story scenery.
The turning stage (formed by Aleksandar Denic) shows an optionally shady street corner, including wallrest and dyenerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer parks in which the Rheintöcher pose as a Rockergirls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil vessels remember Castorf's guiding motif - money, power and greed - that is through its "ring" scenery.
The three Rheintöchters - sang by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), crushing a body in Hollywood-Manier into the trunk room and giving the Krawallo-Clique.
Stephen Milling sings the magnificent fine Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavy-weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he hit Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus oak) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and Dirigent Janowski are celebrated with a stubborn fame, which has a modest and shaped hands to the Merkel-Rout.
There is a great applause for the festival orchestra that shows itself for the first time on the stage - given the great heat again in lower recreational clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team of directors was expected with tension.
If he had to have a valid peiff concert in 2013, there was five years later a great jubile in which the "buh" ropes were undergoing.
The chef of festival Katharina Wagner may have been happy about it.
"You notice that the audience has grown up in a certain way with the "Ring", she said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience did not only make one form of peace with Castorf, but it was also growing an understanding of its views.
I'm pulling a positive resume.
Max Quantity works as volunteer
They work on several places in their volunteer year.
Where else?
Quantity: Normally in Steinfurt in the furniture market, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've already worked at school in the open full day.
How are your experiences with this?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum I see here.
I have to do with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
You're 26 years now, so you're a late-created volunteer.
How's that going?
Quantity: I made abitur.
And then a building engineer study, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I wondered what you're doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on site, perhaps at the focus, really.
And was it?
Quantity: I've collected great impressions.
In the winter semester, I will start my study in the social world.
I will study dually, probably take a social worker training at Herne's Youth Office and study in Hamm at the University of Technology.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of service during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It's always about where you're doing your FSJ.
You can make it from age home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partly in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing that irritated me.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike the construction engineer's degree?
Quantity: Well, this is not about calculating statistics.
They always have other people's heads, each having a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a youth who has been taken out of the family - you always have to enter it individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any anxiety?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but so life is just.
Pearson cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revival the business
The British Education Group Pearson said on Friday that it would degrade another 3,000 jobs and reduce its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressures faced by the company.
The job degradation, which general director John Fallon announced primarily for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, with which 4000 jobs have already been lost.
Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme in May a plan for cost reduction by another 300 million pounds (US dollar 394 million) to re-experience a business that was made by the rapid step towards digital learning.
The company that sold its participation in Penguin Random House in the partner Bertelsmann last month said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it had achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Convoi attack from Kabul: Nato-soldat killed at suicide
A suicide killer attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a soldier of the Nato and injured several others, says officials.
Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, communicated a statement from the Nato.
According to uncertain local reports, three civilians died during the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the last act of violence Afghanistan has taken this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Kabul.
On Monday a suicide offender killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
The Nato opinion states that the explosion had occurred on Thursday evening when a common patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised leap rate" carried by persons.
The statement states that all injured persons are in a stable state and are treated in the U.S. military hospital at the airport of Bagram.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group, known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh, is a great concern for the NATO drops in the nearby bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civil deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which approximately 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide autobomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they would have executed this attack.
On May 31st, a huge bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the most fatal militant attack of the country since the U.S. troops drove the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump considers to increase the number of US troops that support military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in the last few weeks the Suicide Counters in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPO returns decision to delay the Smog rule according to complaints
The U.S. Environmental Authority has repealed a decision to delay the regulation of Obama's government, which obscures the States' obligation to inhibit the smog-producing emissions. This took place a day after 15 states accused the Agency for the step.
The EPO announced the decision to move forward the so-called "Ozone 2015" late Wednesday and said that it showed the obligation of the Agency to cooperate with states.
"We believe in the dialogue with and in responding to our government partners," said EPO-Chef Scott Pruitt in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to delay the ozone regulations in which pollutants emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards by one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 most democratic states, along with the Colombian District, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the attempt was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda, which, according to Trump, is intended to boost economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the relapse of democrats and natural protection groups, which are concerned about the impact of increased emissions on public health.
The EPO website says that breathing air that contains ozone can "reduce the lung function and strengthen the breathing symptoms" such as as asthma.
Community Council wants Community area
At the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a communal area in the future senior apartment.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing property was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will take until the area belonging to the church community is in the property of the municipality, there is no longer a planning barrier for the project to be voted by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area for this purpose.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the Council of the municipalities propose that such a Community area should not only be provided as a meeting point for the residents of the senior residents but also openly enter the community.
As an example, the word of the "Strickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which was preceded by the provision of appropriations for the current budget in the past autumn, is to be taken by means of funding.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a Community area would be eligible, according to Tjaden, by 60 percent of 30 percent.
The proposal provides for a decision to signal the investor that in this respect he does not want to be knocked between the legs, that both sattel- - which is relied on to the environment - as well as Pultdach - which would reduce the height of the trough and make the construction more economically - would be possible.
Not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks that this additive is necessary.
If it helps, unanimously he happens to the board.
It's not so easy in the Community area.
Daniela's call refers to the many own buildings with which you don't get straight ahead for that, now you lean out of the window at the community room, she says, "I'm hard to do with it."
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely voting for the Community area - but absolutely against a local participation.
It sees behind it a concealed subsidy to anyway wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give you a grant, but it is a real counterpart that, in doubt, can be marketable.
Staiger's request to split the decision proposal accordingly will find three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes so: "If we make this decision, we make a huge step towards closing a giant gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Radler is slipped on the street
When crossing the road, a 82-year-old cyclist was recorded in Garath on Wednesday by a car and was seriously injured.
As the police noted, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had come to the direction of Hilden with his bike on the road of Schwarzer Weg.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver travelling in the same direction gave him priority.
When the longfields drove on the road, he apparently did not pay attention to counter traffic.
He collapsed with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildenerin.
The man was pushed to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retardant car.
FC Bayern Munich must refrain from David Alaba and Thyago at the supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The supercup takes place without it: David Alaba must let the game saus against Dortmund.
With staff care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first responsibilities of the new season.
Seven Profis are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Pocal victor.
Staff cares at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are growing before the supercup on Saturday (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also refrain from David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, the Munichs Manuel New, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the last six test games, Ancelotti has responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," said Ancelotti, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
Lastly, it wasn't good."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official responsibilities game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "sworn, intense game."
The duel of the two German soccer weights draws the fans into their ban.
The party is sold out with 81.360 viewers, the German football league (DFL) informed on Friday.
Walk in the resin from star to star
In the resin, the first "star path" is to be created throughout the country.
This is the plant of the club of St. Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information from many resin visitors, it said.
He combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
Members want to set up tablets along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "goodly accessible installations in five to six places" in the upper resin.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, High Geiß and Sieber will be questioned.
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be expanded by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the club explained.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why one star shines stronger than another, although it lie far further away.
It will also be mediated in which constellation a selected star is and when it is best to see.
Since 2014, the club has operated the highest observatory of Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Protection.
Often, from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with mere eye can be seen clearly.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Society, there has been something similar to the planned star turn - the planetary route.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path leads up to the Hainberg and the Observatory - as well as an "exterior" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The stalks with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are precisely set at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a bullet of 6.5 millimeter diameter, while the precisely 75 meters away sun measures at least 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is well four kilometres.
While the light from the sun to the pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour up to the pluto stake.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting box struggle in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unshaked World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, went down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation Super-Federgewicht Champion.
After Garcias victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you a lot of happiness."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko-Manager Egis Climate noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I'm a former spring weight," Garcia recalled.
"I got up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he must move on light weighters [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climates asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135 pound debut this year to agree with Garcia in the next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title struggle in the Forum on 23 September.
"This struggle could take place in Pay-per-View mode because all fans asked for it," said Garcia and later expressed themselves open to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can create this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "a huge fighter" and he might participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks that the three-fight champion from Riverside looks very slowly, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out."
Garcia said that the focus was to show impact, then boxes.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own fight.
"This is the fight that has to be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight."
Four injured by tyre spacer
In an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon, four people were partially seriously injured.
After first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle by 16.30 a.m. shortly before the connector's marketplace, probably after a tyre station.
The car slipped right into the bowl, where it slipped over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially severely injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was locked to the north for about an hour, and then the traffic on the left road at the accident site was passed.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Dryerkette works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes that after the 2:2 seasonal event against Braunschweig, the optimization of defense formation in Aue will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game, with the result, that wouldn't have been the two countertors at 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"They were two countertores too much, and we have to be careful even better in Aue," says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Erzgebirge the Trierkette will also be further optimized.
And a gate after an open door does not want to catch the fortunes anymore.
"For the future, it will be so that no one will stand on the line beside Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better managed after the experiences in preparing with the Trinity chain than with the Fourer Chain.
"I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have just in the triangle on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"The prerequisite is, but that we are even better harmonised and that we do not make so many playback mistakes in the structure."
Of course, Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game.
"Whether you can speak of a misleading start, you don't know.
The performance could be quite okay," said Hoffmann.
"If, however, we can stand there on Sunday with four points and concentrate on the pocal, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper seasonal process."
His trainer didn't want to know about that.
"The start of the season is only six to eight games," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue, just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be canceled early because of an unwedder.
"Now they can almost start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, "the players from Aue might even be somewhat fresher because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know so 100 percent where they are currently," says the internal defender of Fortuna.
The guests from the Rhineland are going to meet on Sunday in the finally (fast) completed stadium of Aue.
"That we take them away just because we have the claim to come under the first six is silly," says Funkel, whose balance is quite positive at just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that one must strike from the outset," explains Fortunas Chefcoach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and superb."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish asylum age evaluation tests published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are over 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started carrying out the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of the age more precise during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migrationsket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some minor refugees.
To date, migration chain has sent 6.880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years old or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old".
The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been constant during the past months.
"We do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the figures are quite constant," he said the magazine The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum applicant lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases "proposing that the examined person is 18 years or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it was 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wise teeth and MRT recordings are made by knees, then analysed by dentists and radiologians, has also been criticized in some areas.
A sceptician is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they have passed through pubertancy earlier or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think that the kind of measurement should be used.
It is very uncertain to assess the biological age in this way.
If we can't be sure, we shouldn't do as if we could," he said the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is incorrect.
The greatest risk is that if the person is nearly under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Fully in the Plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven tons of concrete was installed on the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good in time, it's going great," says Reinhold Light, construction manager at the department of roads and traffic at the government presidium Freiburg.
In April, the work began simultaneously on all three rehabilitation bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is planned for October and light is sure that the schedule will be observed.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a wooden bow bridge made of concrete, dressed with red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
She was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and transport safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They're made of red bunt sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meters wide on the north side on Wednesday morning and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a edge fixture, which is also used as a operating route.
A 2.20 meters wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian path will run on that.
The particular thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
Special feeling of finger tip has required the placement of lines through the building in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a fibre cable that many companies are connected to.
The residents were informed in advance of the work by handnotes on the project.
In addition, fish and cancer had to be fished off first.
For the bridges between the building building and the collector towards Schramberg, traffic is controlled by an ample.
For the construction of the bridge on the Lauterbacher Ortseingang, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is fully locked.
The cost of the three bridge renovations amounts to 700 000 euros.
This is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest at German potato salad
It does not occur so often that parties take a strain, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), what else is difficult to put under a hat.
The parties represented in the circuit day Volcano Eifel (CDU, SPD, Greene, FDP, FWG, Left) are one of a wide alliance that shows peaceful flag on that day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rundell invites to the poster "great election campaign".
And well-known names will start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland is the top duo for the Bundestagswahl on September 24th, and the deputy federal president Beatrix of Storch.
But those who are on-site hours before the event begin, do not want to listen to the AfD students, but demonstrate them.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
The city picnic was originally planned under the motto "all on a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place on the parking space below the roundel - and thus directly before the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
It's a colorful picture.
And what Christa Karoli, Chairman of the Forums A world and one of the relevant organizers, really welcomes: "Toll, how many people have gathered here."
There is music and a lot of food, including a "German potato salad, which the AfD could eat easily," says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reports of the AfD volcanoeifel that he had tried to take such an event and received the supplement.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes not enough parking spaces.
Now the roundell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a beautiful event here."
With a view to the event on the Rondel Front, he says: "This is the good right of people, most importantly, it remains peaceful."
That's what it does: At 20 o'clock, a band provides entertainment, in the city hall various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palzian AfD Chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestagswahl, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal president Beatrix of Storch.
Unchanged is the police presence, but until now the officials had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour the AfD event takes, the guests on the front floor have a longer breath, but also there has been demanded to clean up shortly after 21 o'clock.
The police can reverse - no special events.
Posaun hits trompet
A rehearsal with the Wolfacher Posaunist Frederic Belli are available in the series of Haslacher Concerts of Monastery tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 a.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he presents a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets on Black Forest", or also "Balcanfolklore" meets a classic German training with roots in bubble music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European top-orchestras.
For example, Petkov is solorompeter at the renowned Concert building orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a SWR symphony orchestra solo sanophonyist.
Both unites the desire not only to cross the limits on their instruments but also to merge the limits of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach joins the two as well as in a new garment, Daniel Schnyders "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" of the Jazzecho prize winner Nils Wogram, classical, jazz and free plays mix into a fascinating overall artwork.
This core part of the programme was only launched this spring with enormous success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat him until the end of their life.
But I want to try everything," said Kristen Stewart quite openly about their bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, "Oh that was cool, what's next?"
The most well-known relationship of Hollywoodstar was to her "Twilight" College Robert Pattinson, who finally broke up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette performer assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with any seriously I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?"
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused me or hindered me.
I just never liked to be taken seriously."
In particular, she suffered according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress herself like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me.
When I was eleven, the children told me I would look like a bub.
I really felt attacked, scared, and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, "Mädchen, be proud of you!"
Especially to the public, they don't like to explain their love life: "The people expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And perhaps some call me unthankable, but I don't like to justify myself before the whole public."
The governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
. The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced that he would change the party at an announcement with President Trump on Thursday evening.
Whether you like it or not, the democrats have removed themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thoughts ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The announcement broke out in jubilee.
"I will change my registration to the Republicans tomorrow," Justice added.
"As a trainer, I would say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee gave a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The party change of governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and the control of the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and cannot find a positive, unanimous message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to the CBS News.
Coe praises "honourable" Russian excuse for Doping scandal
On Thursday, the world head of light athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be taken back into the sports.
Russia's Leichtathletik Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Light Athletics World Championships that the banishment of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to combat the doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were caught away in competitions of gold and silver medals".
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to the reporters.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."
Coe said that he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for his re-introduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," said Coe.
"We have to do everything in the next months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will act as neutral players in the light athletic world championships that begin on Friday in London after the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for re-establishment.
Drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free to work, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Sad act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a mourning celebration in the North-Hish Fritzlar, about 1,000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the city under high security arrangements.
The Defense Minister Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the unclear cause of crash.
But she called the two dead pilots "Könners of their expertise".
"We negate from this highest victim they have offered on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Stabs from North Hessen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the western African Mali.
Her sarges were transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a dead guard of the Federal Army to the Fritzlar Dom St. Peter.
In the afternoon, only the members in the church took a goodbye.
Afterwards the sad party began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Federal Army as well as politics.
Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the General Inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker were among them.
Sad guests laid roses, the family were armed in arms on the sarges.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister of the Leyen called the dead soldiers "high decorated" and employed.
The chief of the staff had built the flight operation of the Tiger fighter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regiment.
Also Volker Bauerachs, commander of the regiment, who belongs to the soldiers, said: "If this crew couldn't turn off the crash, no one could have been able to do it."
Certain doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of the Leyen: the use is dangerous.
But he was also of high importance "for a country we are only separated from by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the sarges were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Federal Army did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The man of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
That was what the King's House told on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal pair is joined in the Domkirche of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already produced a sarcophag for the two.
The Queen agrees with her husband's decision, continued in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be confiscated in his French home.
Prince Henrik never made a throat that he wasn't happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe's reign in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016, he retired and also dealt with the title "prince meal".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and the function he wanted, he did not view himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish royal house, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will finally be, it is still unclear.
But he does not intend to be confiscated in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years.
The born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked at the Themse in the French embassy.
During his later wife always flew into the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a severe stand in his nearly 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "For a few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was swaying, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk shrubs instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia Tabak and who had the reputation to be the brand of societal intellectuals, I could not hope for contempt.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
These were two mistakes!"
Prime Minister Because soon wants a new election
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
Niedersachsen's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is after the loss of the red-green government majority for a rapid rechosing of the country day, but he does not want to retreat.
Because on Friday Parliament's resolution was pronounced.
Previously, the surprising exit of a Green member from their country-day fraction in Lower Saxony had crashed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the country's election, the red-green coalition in Hannover lost its scarce one-stemm majority in Parliament to opposition from CDU and FDP.
The previous Green-Deputy Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in its election circle in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hannover.
CDU-Fraction Chief Björn Thümler wants to recommend that his group accept it.
This means that CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Landtag, SPD and Green 68 seats.
To date, the ratio was reversed.
The new country day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year.
Thümler said that the red-green government must now decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Because, however, considers it essential that the country day decides its self-resolution as quickly as possible.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on Tuesday on its further action.
The country constitution also provides for the possibility that the country day withdraws confidence from the Prime Minister and chooses a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined legally clean," said Thümler.
"You'll be quietly discussing all the questions if they're legally considered reasonable."
Thümler called the twestern step "but a little curios".
The politician himself stressed: "I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a followers of Black-Green.
The Greens called on the abtrinsic Members to return their country-day mandate.
"Of course, we assume that they return their country-day mandate, which she received through the green country list, with immediate effect," the national presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner informed.
The Group Chairman of the Green Anja Arrow said: "We deplore the decision of every Twest."
It has deliberately decided not to take a debate in the Group.
"According to the background that there were no content differences, we cannot follow this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the breach of the Dutch Green-Deputy each Twest to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behaviour of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal to the voters, but also a betrayal to Red Green," wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the country day.
The exit of Twesten costs the majority in Lower Saxony.
The politician "set in her injured vainness and in her frustration her personal interests for the sake of the country," criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and tries to beat political capital."
Niedersachsen's CDU Group Chief Björn Thümler recommends that his Members take every Twest into the CDU.
The Group Chief of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, pretended Twesten to fake the result of the 2013 Landtagswahl with personal career thinking.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, SPD and Greens had a thin majority of one voice in the country day.
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoners, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discusses polluted eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is spoken and answered in the interview with the editorial network Germany (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the pressure.
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the Federal States shall provide the latest information on the affected egg charchs.
Any affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if after everything we know at present, a health risk is practically excluded.
Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the educator is not really perceived by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately set up and has since become aware of Germany's concern in close exchange with the authorities of the countries.
All information and risk assessment are available for consumers.
Trade as well as manufacturers must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe for health.
If eggs exceed the maximum residue content of 0.005mg/kg, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not guilty.
Are production companies and consumers sitting in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, production firms do not take direct debt.
Instead, they are expected to have economic damage due to illicit practices of service firms.
As always, there are too little controls in serious cases.
Is there only a lack of staff, or is there a lack of secrecy?
They were just the official controls that have discovered the process.
The truth, however, is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent.
This is why a consistent information of such events and the transfer to public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may occur are crucial.
I have already repeatedly made it clear that I expect the responsible authorities to inform them.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to get exclusively safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly offended.
This means that manufacturers, distributors and consumers have become a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food suppliers of animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be consistent on all levels and worked with high pressure.
I expect all the competent authorities to see that the fact is being clarified quickly and unnoticed.
How the financial rules of football affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar's World Record Transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come from the UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain, because the leading organization that has monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be more than 10 million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team through the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the break-eleven point in their soccer business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations who had debts great in their pursuit of success effectively deceived and risked ruining when banks or owners withdraw their support.
In 2011, FFP relocated from concentration on the debts of clubs to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter.
During the current three-year FFP investment period that runs until 2018, clubs can increase losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen by the Presidency in Ungnade in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to use to deteriorate excessive expenditure.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the purchase-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for the accounting of the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of payments can be paid for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, together with Abu Dhabi, owned by Manchester City, hit the PSG with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (approximately 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remained limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by raising their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a catalytic company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, the UEFA would not consider this as legitimate income.
That was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the 2022 World Cup Organisation Committee.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar will become WM ambassadors and that such a maneuver for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to deal with the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press under the terms of anonymousness, since they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.
The last published reports show that PSG 2015/16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship dealers, merchandising and tricot sales.
The association assumes that after the signature sales will rise by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the President of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager, Arsenal Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that funds an association.
"It is the consequence of the ownership and this has changed the entire countryside of football completely over the past 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a club, everything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggi supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has produced board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now, such cooperation is at a possible end: the airline rewrites the order.
Swiss spokesman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report from the Friday newspaper "Nordwest-Schweiz" on request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied," said the speaker.
Approximately 17 million small redwise packed Schoggitables to 14 grams per year distribute the flight companions before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to make any information about the costs.
Industryinsider estimates the volume of order according to "North-West-Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a Schoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants are involved in the new invitation to tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
But only Swiss manufacturers are in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss has been distributed by chocolate tackles since 2006 on board their flights.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migro's daughter, Barry Callebau delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility of placing the logo, Swiss introduced two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, customers of the First Class are spoiled with delicacy by the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class naked passengers Schoggi by Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Also on the short track, Swiss Schoggi is distributed by Chocolat Frey, both in business and economy class.
Light athletics - Discus-Olympiacist Robert Harting reaches WM-Finale
The three-time world champion fights for a medal on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympician of 2016, failed in the national WM excretion and could only look at the discus competition from the tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final struggle.
Nostalgie goes in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" to the niche
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s-years-grunge-Ara (as prethinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the "The State" comedy for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Ruddd went to greater things.
As a cultural artifact, it is likewise a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like the time was short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffing on the core of the gag - actors in the middle of age play yellow children who will grow up - they nevertheless managed to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults who are now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting candy principle, including a reef on the stalk films of the 90's such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand that Swings the Cradle").
At one point a character is created by an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novel author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there is another mad-like plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr Showalter) is included, which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's sublift beard of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knocker.
It's the moments of accidental madness that could heat this franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion: "White Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the bands how it will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-west ring fighting iconography.
The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, as a director, says to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-spoke Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a genius idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are a few beautiful gags to look at (the police spend the time watching chess on television, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda dramas - a murderer who wears a Reagan maske - that it often plays like one one.
With six long episodes, it draws out, and the comedy is not fast or frequently enough.
"Comrade Detective", which was done at a lower length, could better deliver his Agitprop satellites, as Gregor and Iosef regularly visit the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a lot of Hamburger.
The message for the imaginated Communist audience is that the Western culture can make everything a feed for a situation.
The fictional Romanian Creator was not wrong: We do it even with our own younger history and with the one who is her.
Schlag gegen Drogen-Mafia in the country
The police succeeded in the fight against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, many objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the Staatsanwaltschaft Konstanz notified on Friday.
15 accusers between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued detention orders against them.
In addition, the officials ensured greater quantities of marijuana and cocaine, guns and several hundred thousand euros.
Two persons were arrested for simultaneous razcia in Italy.
There were German detention orders against the two suspects of Italy.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
Over 300 policemen were employed in total.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, rape and extortion.
Since summer 2016, the state prosecutor of Konstanz has been investigating against the organised drug trade in the South German region.
Between the Staatsanwälte in Konstanz and Palermo, there was a regular exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday morning, four officials from Palermo were also accompanied by the great use.
In the investigations, it was mainly Italian nationals with close reference to the Italian Mafia.
Also an incident in Hüfingen on 27 May, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is expected to go to the account of the bands.
Way complains big gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens that should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany has considerable deficiencies.
This leads to partly serious mistakes in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen, has highlighted major gaps in the foreign central register.
In the case of asylum procedures and deportations, deficiencies in the data recorded there could lead to "partly serious mistakes" in an analysis provided by the South German newspaper.
According to the register, ten million people with foreign nationality are included, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
Accordingly, the data is managed by approximately 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases data have been found from 1921, "of people who have long been no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register".
"Incorrect data entry can slow down return processes considerably," the report continues.
In addition, the statistics on travelling people include EU citizens who do not have to leave.
Such false assignments, however, led "to a distorted debate on how to deal with travellers," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to return to Italy to refugee families with under 16-year-old children when they arrive from there.
This is the result of an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
Accordingly, the paper states that the BAMF has carried out such procedures "with regard to families with children, with the exception of infants and children, to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014 it was practically impossible, the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on site.
Under the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU State are responsible for which they are first attained.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this State can send it back to the country of entry.
To explain, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the capacity of reception for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECMR) considers that these commitments are sufficient.
Other EU countries would also return refugees to it under the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political speaker of the left-fraction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Familys with children threaten because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system of human rights infringement conditions and a threat to child welfare".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichbach already provided the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
All ahead Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the meeting of the municipal council, the municipality honours the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's ingenious how our body is designed for it, and we'll pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to strangers, even ineligible to it," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"One single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit head of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conservations are crushed into their components.
So three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported the actions carried out in Oberreichbach in spring.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DRK recruitment leader.
Obviously, the change to theatre house led to higher number of participants a few years ago.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations made each.
Half so many book Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Veter 10 times per 500 millilitres from their juice.
The Bank of England will keep the interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weakening of inflation have deteriorated speculations over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that the economic growth will remain "indebted" when it maintains interest rates on family income in the middle of an increasing pressure.
The decision-makers of the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with less members seeking an increase in this month as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1,6% for 2018 and warned that pressure on budget income would continue, with an autumn inflation expected to rise to nearly 3%.
But it signaled that in the next few years, interest increases would be necessary to reduce the inflation heated by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut economic package, which was published a year ago after the Brexit.
It will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to make 15 billion more available within this system - with 115 billion sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on the real income of households continues to burden the consumption."
On the interest rates, it repeated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool off inflation and a "what greater" level than the markets expect.
Markets are forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020.
The Bank stressed, however, that increases would be "steady" and "limited".
The bank's down-corriged growth forecasts for this and next year are compared with the 1,9% forecast in May and 1,7%.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after these news compared to the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision does not change after the recent deterioration of growth has deteriorated the rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP has increased to 0.3% in the previous three months in the second quarter of the year.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be slightly recovered after the bank by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report was little enthusiasm for households that are affected by increasing inflation and low salary increases, as it becomes even worse before it gets better.
She added that in the next few years, monetary policy cannot "prevent" the inequality of income, but she added that the wages will be "indefinite" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will compensate for some of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote caused the reduction of the pound.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to reach the prices and the economy fully.
Before the bank's final judgment on interest rates, the reputation for an increase in interest rates had increased, as inflation increased pressure on heavy households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation decreased from 2.9% in June last month to 2.6%, although the bank said that this was expected and would relocate it in the coming months.
The Bank said that the overrun in relation to its 2% target was "all" to be attributed to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is expected to become more competitive, since creditors are looking for business loudly and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of the existing deales and complete the new mortgages, and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is intended to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September to September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sex, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered from healthcare through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself willing to finance the process after the Appeal Court confirmed last year a judgment by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should fund it.
The chess train announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Preexposition prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious persons.
Taking PrEP before sex means that just enough medicines are present in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sex.
Among those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered in a house doctor can also register for a possible participation in their locally participating sexual clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the delivery of medicines this week after an internationally competitive acquisition.
The study is intended to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as it is used, taken and implemented in a large scale.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in meeting one of the greatest health challenges of mankind."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when it is targeted on the needy and endangered people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September on, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and does not be subject to a negotiation with a partner, which leads to improving many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chairman of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one with a risk to HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been provided, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overwhelmed after months of delay and delayed implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will contribute to the end of the distribution of HIV in society one step closer."
Living the big life: Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014.
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.
"Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I searched for something that was comparable to my price.
This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely overloaded.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add a storeroom and an intermediate floor to use the generous ceiling height optimally.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms above each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they had been stacked over each other, without having to buck ourselves.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but also creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height above each other - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate floor, a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Reflected gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, room and light.
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let it work longer.
In the kitchen the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the caps and glasses of Joanne.
By percepting a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if not used.
Collapsable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage agency.
"A bit of engineering went into it," explains Erfan of the steel strengthened, furnished MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so if you push up the door, it's very easy to glide."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base surface - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have been able to increase the ground surface and at the same time use high-quality materials that provide the room with its luxury advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
"You're not in love with the electric boxes in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard to something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate imperial
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a conflict because of one of Victoria’s largest real estate imperial worth more than $500 million.
The former director of Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis live in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how to divide their property and business assets.
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute on separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars, since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail businesses.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul described as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.
A court act states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are fighting for control of the existing business, from which Colin, as Paul claims, had excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but suggests Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.
In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to clarify the dispute.
"My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The cost increases in the case, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicate shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood-Liegenschaft, where Colin opened the family's first jeansladen.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years high school when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass her property kindly on to her sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land before court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Company Group, claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars on leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, "become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the television star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say, "I really can't say much," because the case is before the courts.
"It's very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's claims.
"Our father wouldn't have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that he'd still hope for a solution."
On Friday this hope seemed to be over.
"Our case will be resolved by the courts in the near future," said Colin.
Trump's new staff plants to limit the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new head of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the reports of the news media, in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, met with senior employees on his first working day, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in letterings - because the President would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is decades back - and now where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was angry for an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts that were to be convinced," said former election advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes an ongoing prize."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we don't know to others - that Trump's Tweets would have included more ignorance without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the Tweets who didn't send Trump.
If his employees had already managed to keep him away from anger several times, then their efforts have been rewarded.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
A part of the problem is that people in a white house consisting of competing parties are constantly trying to bring their own agenda forward by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - all concerned with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultants to provide the President with doubtful information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he tightens to find out where they originate.
That was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone offended to the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy staffman Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a lot of leaks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banished from Twitter because of horrors or that he had not offered concrete evidence or that he had spoken wrong accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started to question staff about Walsh."
Goldmaker added that at that time the staffman Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "had tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that gets Trump".
How did that work?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager as a priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.
These unchanged factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.
Most sought criminals get post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the support of the population is asked and hoped.
The police across Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the opposed serious criminals are naturally not known, indications from the population are hoped and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action followed by the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of winter.
Experiences have shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, says Europol.
21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016, the website www.eumostwanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online seekers have been arrested so far, at least eleven of them due to instructions after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate over a tomb and return to the 'Millionary Row'
Some of the most wealthy houseowners of the West Midlands are again standing with some determined travelers on the foot of war, who have negotiated a tomb drawn from the community to call back a field before their men's houses.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull, called the "Millionar Series".
They brought horses, babies, and an army of transporters, after they were thrown out only in May, but without being scared by a sepulchre excavated by the Council in order to prevent their attacks.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense plants and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angerful residents have harassed the Council of Solihull, who said that it is "sustainless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were shipped by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers.
The Council must be forced by shame to implement in fact because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop this."
A resident who didn't want to be called said: "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The figures have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the park area."
One speaker of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull Police. We take the necessary legal steps to move them forward as soon as possible.
In order to support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This contributes to creating a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof will become Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof, the Waldhotel Luise is made.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently renovated and will be opened again on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the mbH at the time, on April 13, 2014, about 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenues from the Kurtax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collecting accommodation in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the housing of asylum applicants by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council at that time.
But above all, the city of Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of seriously interested people in the house at that time.
He should keep right.
The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category called Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the city of joy.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, the extensive renovation work will be done.
The floors were cut out, blankets were partially demolished, old bathtubs were removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There is a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything is supposed to be "beautiful close to the citizen" later, as Thomas Scher says.
"We want to make a jewel drain."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.
You do not want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated downtown level, emphasises Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He had talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause already, says Scherer.
The ideas of the city are equal to those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asking for the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to decide exactly.
Nearly under a million euros, he expects.
The external plants are also brought to the front, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affairs: U.S. Special Seniors set up Grand Jury
In Russia's affair around US president Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller has, according to a report, used a so-called Grand Jury.
In recent weeks, the Board has started the work, wrote the "Wall Street Journal" on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper appreciated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already first invitations to the Board in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US secret services have long been accusing the Kremlin of having interfered specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump's electoral team and Moscow.
The investigations should focus on several men who acted in the election struggle as consultant of the Republicaner.
According to reports, Mueller also examined more and more Trump's private and business environment.
The "Washington Post" wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump personally went to the centre and examined the accusation of whether the President might have hindered the justice in the course of affairs.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether to charge charge.
Grand Jurys is therefore also called charge chambers.
They are usually turned on when they are larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The body can also be set up by the prosecutor to invite persons to interrogation under oath.
According to the transmitter CNN, invitations to meet Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer have already been issued.
Persons involved in the meeting were asked for a statement, said the report.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then champion Paul Manafort were also involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the introduction showed that Mueller did not get intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be set up at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the Board is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the middle of the new revealings, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affairs as a campaign for his political opponents.
"The Russian history is a total invention," Trump said.
The theme gives the democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else about which they can talk".
His special advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he emphasized.
The White House endorsed any action that accelerated the work of the Special Intermediate in a "fair" way.
The former FBI Chief James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the President.
There is no reason to believe that this has changed something, the explanation continues.
Mueller had only been used after Trump camey had fired.
Because of this noisy, he had become loud of accusations against Trump, he wanted to hinder the justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump had asked him to stop the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the Special Agent and his employees.
This triggered speculations about whether Trump Mueller wants to escape.
Unlike an independent special investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate office around later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could be fired theoretically on the urges of the President by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and democratic senators introduced drafts of laws that would no longer allow the special investor to be released so easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In the Westantarktis, a gigantic iceberg of the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin has been dissolved from the Schelfeis.
This was notified by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, which is more than a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, now drives north and will probably need two, three years until it was melted.
It is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades with a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers.
A danger for people doesn't come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear according to researchers.
In total, however, there has been a series of unusual collapse of ice creams in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.
Many researchers believe that this could be related to the warming of the earth.
The now aborted colossus was a part of the Larsen-C boot.
Shelfeis swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America near the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
A few years ago, the balance of waxes and cancellation was disturbed at the north of this pitch.
A complete asshole was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C shell is also in danger, because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently.
In addition, the ice plate is under voltage and could fall down if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of bowls and iceberg does not increase the sea level as it swims on the water and drifts as much ice as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelter leads to the glaciers being forced directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C shell is the fourth largest shelf in Antarctica after AWI statements with almost 50 000 square kilometres.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front side to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice sign now comes into a more endangered position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Svansea University.
"This is the greatest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was controversial whether the Larsen-C shell would grow again or go back in the long term and perhaps collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not lead to climate change, many of the ice crews of the Antarctic Peninsula have broken down over the past decades.
This long zipper of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarcic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature rise has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years and thus counts among the areas where the temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants Haustarif at staff
As it becomes more and more difficult to occupy freely, the CDU calls for the employer's association to be more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the Kreistag has spent 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circuit administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 more trainees have their first working day behind themselves.
The teachers at the circle are apparently very desirable.
Approximately 620 applications were available for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks.
There are currently 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district.
For example, doctors and engineers and powers of general administration will be sought.
The CDU now wishes to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and address the lack of expertise in the administration.
According to the request of the parties, the administration is intended to "elaborate a concept of personnel and personnel development".
The aim is not only to address short-term needs for professionals but to address the shortcomings of applicants in the future.
The overall concept should focus on inside and outside, show concrete measures for cross-border climbers, and include training opportunities, demanding CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that weren't known earlier.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is about a real "competition of public employers".
There is a high number of employees who exclude disease or old age from the service.
So the maximum time to act so that no more jobs remain unoccupied.
However, Klaus-Dieter Völker, the CDU Group Chief, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He recently, in the circle day, provided a fuzzy surprise when he challenged the staff cost coverage publicly and the other parties were astonished.
Peoples want to review all the possibilities that allow a withdrawal from the local employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the circuit administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should seek a domestic tariff," says Völker.
The CDU thus seeks to pay the employees and officials better than the tariff regulation for the public service actually provides.
The salaries are currently prescribed precisely, there are increases or more money only if you change into a higher level, oriented to professional years.
However, the roles of the circle have increased in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago were new spaces to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy sharpens the tone to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign new Code of Conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis' warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Young Rettet' because their team effectively worked with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on detailed accusations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, the salvation of human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media.
"We can only assess all the allegations currently raised after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of 'Young Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is assumed that his crew takes hose-boat migrants on board, which are delivered directly by human dealers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the Act of Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overlooking the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the humanitarian rescue activities in the zone and not for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have a Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far declared ready to comply with the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable because they would not bring "real changes or disabilities" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize Organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has declined significantly in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastal guard and cooperation with the local mayors have produced fruit.
"In the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Increases and trials
Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the northern palm to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friends guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
The viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could view well above the palms of forest and the preceded plains.
There were repeated increases in between, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day it went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and Volksfest Würstmarkt.
Again, viewpoints grew at the point of view, linked by "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
On the last two days, many meters of height had been reclaimed.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and cottages brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers at the open air inhalatorium healing Sole.
New Town was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 meters of height, the group had met the palms of the forest from its best side - sporting and cultural -.
Console instead of racing - Bundesliga is equipped for E-Sport
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting swiftly at wind and weather over the stadium racing?
Fact is: E-Sport has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gagen included.
This has also recognized the first Bundesligavereins that are increasingly involved in this area.
In 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04, and lastly the VfB Stuttgart, founded an E-Sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game under contract.
"We hope to enthusiast the VfB very new target groups," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that there are still several associations on this train."
The next weekend, the FIFA soccer world association organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of different clubs meet against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"In particular, the real football needs to deal with the 14-30-year-olds that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The associations tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With prominent e-porters under contract, you could be much more present online on these markets than just sending the Federal League team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is this about?
At E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or just FIFA soccer simulation are fighted at competition level.
Longestly, as in normal sports, lignites have established themselves in which the professionals appear against each other.
And in the 2022 Asian games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it at all a right sport?
For many, the idea is certainly customary.
Also Ingo Froböse has been dealing with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormone change.
In addition, it needs cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and quick reactionability.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also train their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fitte player is a good player."
Frobige also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of the E-Sport.
The players are travelling internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study of the company consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth to the E-Sport.
In 2016, 50 million euros had been implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and large tournaments.
In three years, sales will be 130 million.
This is little to the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football League.
However, the E-Sport is "not far away from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.
Internationally, many countries are already continuing.
Great markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport bet provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot of action in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, E-Sport was introduced as a course of education, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and in France, the football firstliga associations, according to Dutt, are now obliged to set up an E-Sport department.
"In the European comparison, Germany goes back," explains VfB Board of Directors Röttgermann.
Only falling into nostalgy and clarifying the ancient times is no longer enough today.
The aim is to preserve the association's tradition, but at the same time to establish the company on the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"There's no way to hold that only the soccer remains everything as it was always."
Gift egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
By now, almost all federal countries are affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs.
Aldi South and Aldi Nord have responded and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that prove to contain no fipronil are to be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter condemns the texts that conrad Roy insist on suicide.
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind grids and five years have been suspended.
In June, Carter was sentenced to kill Conrad Roy, who died on July 13, 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free until the call.
She had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psychic disease.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy flower, Carter stood there with tears in the eyes, with folded hands and looking down eyes when she was sentenced.
"Your actions killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility," she said.
"She showed no repentance."
But Carters Lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she totally regrets".
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find out that her "older or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions".
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is no "day on which I do not trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pains we will bear with us for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "traced" by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having this only person with whom I had been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone else to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"High up, jump from a building, first yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was with his family in vacation.
In the moments before his suicide she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is switching on the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared the legal opinion.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to her British resident in Italy in 2007 before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new mini lame of the FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.
The FC Bayern holds a great season to the Confed-Cup winner - Extra-Motivation doesn't harm it.
Something else was on his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even though the additional garment was very small.
But since there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel New on the second day of the Audi Cup, he made himself the bond assigned to him to hold on the arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner said afterwards, after his first use as Bavarian captain.
Well, the bet could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could interpret Kimmich as well.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been elected as a game leader, but he was elected from youth players, debutors and just from vacation.
Sugar is best distributed to those who want to hold a lot of mood.
So whoever was chosen to enter the heritage of lahm can only use a little extra-motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flew as a mini lame over the field.
On the right, that's his position now, the white bond on the arm did her other thing.
And at all, Kimmich worked in this start formation like the one that can best take the rod.
He gave instructions, tried to lend the unprecedented troop.
He had the view for the whole while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal, with overplaying his lack of fitness ( hardly folded); Renato Sanches thus joining the devil to the achievements of Asia's journey (fold only conditional); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not negatively noticed in their first appearance in the Bavarian tricot.
After all, that worked very well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted sovereign.
The reputably occupied Napoli storm was often hard to do, soles also tried to build up a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he also showed a proper performance at the debut.
Game shift, tempo change: "For this style I was also picked up."
How uninhabited this Bavarian world is still for new accesses, one saw after the party.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but decided six or seven interviews.
Kimmich agreed after a few cracky statements in the back of his new competitors.
There he heard from Süle an interesting sentence: "What goes down here, I have already noticed.
In Bavaria you just have to win every game."
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new one anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB-Damen
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB deeds
Austria's most famous footballer reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB-Damen everything good.
The Bavarian-Legionary is quasi club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and feberts with our ladys.
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivation syringe.

Company satisfied with rheinland-pälzische Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It was often unreasonable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still economic minister of Rheinland-Pfalz.
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at the same time as the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Trier Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has blocked all of it."
The largest turn around Natus sees in infrastructure policy: The gaps of the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau are now very high in the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure, and the construction law will stand until 2021.
A role in the country's plans also plays the western circumstance of Trier, which is indispensable to the demand of the Federal Road Plan.
The aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says ministerial speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees it as a guide to support regional, but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as suggested by Wissing, strives to offer a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exporting for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, the IHK praises.
The Chair of Crafts Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is provided for the existing master test and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master training.
The homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, there are rapid facts to be created, at the same time, the country lacks the necessary staff, says Jan Glockauer, head of the IHK Trier.
Of 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing in the country's operation mobility, only 29 jobs are currently occupied.
The IHK demands to award more contracts to external offices.
CDU-Fractionsvize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors, the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, as it wants to fix the lack of expertise in the region.
It is also fascinating to be the previous broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies had assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with Note 3.4.
They complain about stocking Internet connections and breakdowns.
Ex-economic minister Eveline Lemke, however, is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Force Company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it already opened up after four months because of disagreements.
Audi is intended to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confronted with a counter-reaction
One day before Audi announced, BMW said that it would offer to update the software into more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that "there is more intelligent options than driving restrictions" and thus refers to European cities - including Munich where BMW is located - to prohibit or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles would be modified in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the operations as a withdrawal.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of the automotive manufacturers to install neutralisation plants of exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases, making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of heating the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagens that could regulate the use of so-called shuttle devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car is tested but resume on normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees were charged by Volkswagen and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's motor development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be courted in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was included in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to deal with the emission rules in Europe, and an application concentrated on the United States was expanded.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could be severely stressed by Volkswagen: the luxury automotive manufacturer contributes overproportionally to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the flood on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to join the Isar visitors, a flood passes through Munich on tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
When it moves to the Isar on Saturday, it will see a large river between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common fleet with Isar tourists.
Except the building reference wants to clarify.
On the fleet you see a large info transparency.
It shows a garbage mountain.
The start of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "Where love is ..." the understanding of the Isar is to intensify as a protective wildflow.
Last summer the flood crossed the Isar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillo's Knollennose and laughing against suffering
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoon drawings, the knolnases of his figures are his trademark.
The Argentineer also draws with 85 and works on a film.
His message: laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, he struck himself, among other things, as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
The artist of cities was always inspired.
Large, round murderillo figures tumble in drawings with the shaft tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he still sits his own information on the sign table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for large and small, T-shirts, pluckers and watches, its drip figures continue to be widespread worldwide.
He has also been working on a drawing film and a TV series with his figures for six years.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a Giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand fusser as a counter player.
For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which will come to the Kinolein wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange to me," says Mordillo.
The script is not written by him.
That is why he is rather on the TV series that, like its original drawings, is produced unwittingly.
Lavendel from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases, which causes great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavendel in the Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change in recent years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifetime of lavendel.
There is also a small cide, a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cedars, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavendel oil attracts not only for vacationers, it is also very demanded for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: " Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
The solutions considered include a better distribution of water and the slowing down of evaporation from the ground, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhine is celebrating its 1200-year-old existence.
The festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, tails, distributors, vagants, or a land slave camp should be experiencing in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet in the meantime to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in Sinaloa State through the organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They have been informed that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure: they should take their children to the office, which was the target of an attack with granates in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary to reach perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to be on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no retirement break from violence, and while the bodies are growing throughout the country, there are more and more journalists in it: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto entered his office in December 2012. 589 stands after attacks and threats under federal protection and so far there were at least seven dead in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirator of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
Its lack is deeply felt, although its presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts that show his smile face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, dreams, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.
Although a special prosecutor was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it has only initiated two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely sentenced.
At Riodoce, they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsistent and although the terrain is still more betrayal.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little advantage, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"As long as we don't know why, we're all defiant."
On the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The protector drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Gerüchte tends to fly freely around in Culican.
But there is practically nothing but silence about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story mouse oils for drug kings who are larger than many houses for the living.
For a minute forget that there is a state of "ruhe" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gang members purchased each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper skioske.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country to his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in the founding of Riodoce and sold $50.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without putting on the issue of noise toxicity," said Bojorquez.
In time, the newspaper deserved a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporter loved to be able to publish heartfelt investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Price" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting the Mexican drug history, wherever she led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trade in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
"You have to take over the task you like as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid ones.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird that could curse like a harbour worker, the friend who was generous with embraces and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his corruption?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.
"You don't like it if you deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret start and landing tracks", to move drugs.
"These things weren't allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high level of self-censur and self-conservation.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The anger is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, "Geruch a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other countries where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the area where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, no mobile phones were suddenly allowed. Days before, it became known that Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police seek protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.
They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in scarcely, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police who the governor himself claimed not to be trustworthy.
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug bands are de facto under control.
For the issue this week, Riodoce looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé to the state expenditure concentrated on the home town of the governor.
And there was a group that took a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culican, a block from the office of the prosecutor.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost the entire century over all political levels.
Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-carity cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.
Only a few months earlier, the readers would have viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping.
"We had already known what happened before," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim body.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they would never have expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the Office of the Prosecutor.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials said, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Journalists throughout the country have become more loud by writing down "SOS Press" in organized protests on roads and buildings.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for the justice in Valdez case.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of pioneering and killing journalists because they have said the truth.
She has since asked her to be reorganized by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "giving" of organized crimes, government officials involved and an indifferenced society.
In his last book "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters were killed not only by drug bands but also by politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organized crime.
The media guard group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police and official journalists last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a devastating effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas Cardell: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separated head.
Some branches have chosen to conclude, as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was addressed publicly to the drug card with a guide article on the front page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted as it seemed to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trafficker scares him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the side of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to summ.
A number of shootings with band rivals and security forces near the city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war further escalated as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the edge of the boardstone, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens hurled up near - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the police who kept guards to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his traces.
"How can you think about closing," said Bojorquez, "if the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to report on the street."
Dinosaurs used tartment to evacuate his enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his shy skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had something of a "unhappy past".
The report in the magazine "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best-restained pantsed dinosaur, which has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosauri, which lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the creed season.
His incredibly well preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the planted fried is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock at the square, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years exploring the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy earth glue.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you only blister with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said chief author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurians."
Researchers have found out that this plant-fresser, although covered with a armor and similar to a walking tank, was probably threatened by meat-dinosaurusers.
The highly pantsed dinosaur used a red and white tartment to hide from robbery, and used a shielding technique known as countershadowing, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, say experts, what indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosauri family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild beast and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully discover it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the shape of shrubs and arms to document over his body.
They discovered the countershadowing, a widespread defense method in the animal realm, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although countershade is common, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta exceeds the size of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure from meat-fressing dinosaurs that evolution favoured the wear of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use countershadowing - think of rifles, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, which signals that this nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Stark ravenous behaviour on a massive, highly gepanzered dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the creed age must have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal on evidence of his life, including its preserved intestine content, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out of the sea, where he was sinking on the back to the sea ground.
At this time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and preserved the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early crown season.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you're just a little shining with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's sleeping."
The crown period was a time when huge theropods, meat-fearing dinosaurians, who stood on two legs, crossed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived for millions of years after Borealopelta, the pantsed dinosaur was chased by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.
The scientists, whose latest insights appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that borealopelta was invaded after death in the sea and mummified in the mummy.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was found on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-restrained dino saurer in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the snail to the hip.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that pulled from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the planted fried was flooded through Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The rocked remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin residues still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaurier
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is like a profit in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it will be.
Rocked residues of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right front foot lies on his side, his five fingers are sprayed upward.
I can count the shrubs on his sole.
In the thunderstorm: Mass Carambolage on A8: Many injured
Accident accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Knapp 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are many injured, mileage - and Gaffer.
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage late Thursday afternoon.
According to the police's first information at 5:00 a.m., between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg County) connectors were nearly 30 vehicles during a thunderstorm, including probably trucks.
The exact number of injured persons was not given at first.
It's light to medium-sized injuries, said a police speaker.
A great bid on rescue vehicles was at the accident site.
The A8 was completely locked towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a 10-kilometre backstau was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the counterway - by numerous gaffers.
The firefighter noted the signs of the vehicle drivers, who are now expected to be sensitive punishments.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue shooter was on the way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group testes "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced once: nothing conceives you sit in the train and sleep.
Or you're deepened in your work and just have a fantastic thought.
And then: pufff.
Come the jacket and wake a scent or rip the passenger from the middle of the workflow.
Card control.
But the times of interruption are over soon.
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the skillless ticket control.
You just confirm by phone that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"If the offer comes, we'll expand it.
It will then be expected to be available on many other distance routes in Germany at the beginning of the next year," said a railway speaker.
"Comfort Check-in" the train calls the ticket devaluation without Schaffner.
In order to use them, however, some conditions need to be met: You need a smartphone or tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do.
It must also be made via the app of the train that DB Navigator has bought, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.
And last time you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you climb into the train, call his ticket under "My tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear in the test customers.
The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train companion comes at the ticket control at place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"Whoever wants to travel through our train companion without ticket control simply checks in the DB Navigator itself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time personal in the train," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board of DB Remote Transport.
Second Plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who often drive trains know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket controls are among the greatest annoyances.
Because you often have yourself, but in any case one of the participants does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or staff card is missing or otherwise a document you have to present.
The result is endless discussions between train managers and passengers, which leads to a bad mood in part or large space and delays in controlling their own ticket and the sheepfender takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that's just the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "What Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the in St. Louis was born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stole through a post from a high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the road," it said there.
Confusion because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the @TheePharoah handle was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of killing the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed live by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's living body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," said Ferrell in herself.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She put her cell phone off to return later in the evening to Tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who had a sign with the note: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a calling dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman reassured his rifle and shouted, "I'm gonna kill you... animals all."
"That's not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder we used to and which we can typically call."
At that moment, I felt shhüttelfrost.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary, "What Streets?", in the movies from the 11th century.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that consists of people who live in the Community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell traveled to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times this morning "on the black experience and the black condition".
"You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe in?" she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," said Ferrell later.
"What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky to give her an experience where she personally does not experience an eclatant racism, she's not different from the next black women's kid.
I have the feeling that I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a campground when the activists waited for the possible non-profit of Officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly, a new type of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
"My activism has changed completely after 9 August," she said and notes that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurse Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
Weeks later Ferrell met during a evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-regisseurs of the film.
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to mind Ferrell: "Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"
This scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to make it different."
Folayan had already worked with Damon Davis, a former co-director, an artist from the area known for his activism around death tract inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of "What Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We're talking to us," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but is a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film.
As a result, documents of "What Streets?" show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she is in love and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
Ferrell's history also repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, which, after the death of the black teen of Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media identify themselves as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have wore the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting at different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the main load of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women".
However, it insists that "this is not a affirmative type of action", in which Ferrell was selected as a heart of the film because of its identity.
"She was the person who ruptured this energy," she said.
"It's not a coincidence, although she was at the front front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, dull woman is so much at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
In the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial links between the municipality and the police remain.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the social policy atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A chaos".
Nevertheless, she sticks to a singing and feels obliged to this memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "droom" to "size deck": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping center at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold hardly leaves the topic.
The topic will also be discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While one of them say to the bit gallery: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really classy" (Nicole Shows), from the other side comes: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Sizedwahn!" (Lars Scholz).
While the supporters build on the fact that a gallery is moving more customers into the city, which also benefit the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
Additionally, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farm market hall is located, where 13 direct sellers offer their products.
This will end with the start of the construction work.
The Galerie-Macher wants to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda-Platz with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Rooms: "We have been buying almost weekly in the Farm Market Hall for many years.
Mostly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women are always very happy.
We've also discovered the metzgear for ourselves.
We would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.
In other cities there are also.
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct sellers sit in a market hall in the gallery, arrive at the height of the rental.
This is probably not a low one in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "Where do shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I think it's superfluous.
There's enough of it in our city.
You see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
In any case, the product offered there is fresh, is largely offered directly by the producer and is above price value.
As you see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Shame, special businesses are almost out of place, and what is left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
Above all, where will the farming market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even on a long time when the bit gallery actually comes sometime.
Or does the spice bit gallery already manage to dismiss all shops from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "This will simply not work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
I think it would be better to promote a proper farm market instead of this gallery.
But for a farm market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer give place.
When the farm market hall is broken, another piece of culture will disappear."
A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery room in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost unmarkably similar - which hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the sections from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst banned a 35-year prison sentence after she made secretly classified diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is A Becoming Resemblance (a suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise into technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transfraude and dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has, through the algorithm analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone might look with these genomic data, a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but since her puberty has spoken openly about the identification as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six infringements against the spying law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning seemed to sit unwelcome on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blowing pruff - with which she was associated.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette drums and gums by extracting DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people might look.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at that time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned museum became uneven letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foretold a future in which President Chelsea’s judgment would be transformed and she could see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy gathering.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informers from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, dubious ways to further flame the staring divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end of the "automatic fragmentation, whose basic sex, race, sexuality and culture have been, with its overwhelming signature (the "i" in their family name).
On the opposite wall, its mitochondriale DNA sequence is written in pencil - a thousand furnaces of Cs and Gs and As.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, can also be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in its own room is a page from the comic novelle mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears in hand with a free-speaking telephone from the disciplinary boxes of the United States like King-Kong.
"When they cold your speech, they have won," it says.
"So never hold your mouth."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist who greets from Philadelphia.
"I'm still going to get goose when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was previsored in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room, by their own genomic simulacres, which unite together like Hords of Protestants.
That was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of people," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind their liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee at Oxford University for killing
A country-wide human hunt is in the Gange for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who is sought as suspect after a man had been eradicated in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) detention orders were issued for murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the Cook County Office Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on July 27th.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of the event, and detectives examine the slopes as murder, while the police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of University Relations, said in an e-mail explanation that Lathem had now been admitted and had been excluded from the entry of the campus of Northwestern University.
"This is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is a senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail explanation that "we are in contact with the British police and willing to help the U.S. detection authorities in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthening," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Grand Plaza Management Team published a statement to the residents: "The police is currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will finish the WADA road plan in the near future" - the Russian Vicepremier Mutko
The Russian Vicepremier Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take a long time to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a particular stage of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA plan was updated in this respect," said Mutko on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA schedule for compliance with the code which describes the criteria for reintroduction of RUSADA and has recently been published on the organisation’s website.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything that might cause Russia to worry.
"Everything has been announced, everything is implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria listed in the list notes that the Russian anti-doping authorities must accept publicly the results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to claimed state-promoted dopings in Russian sports.
In relation to the matter, Mutko said: "We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has had an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programmes, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the Moscow's headquarters in July, WADA General Director Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be re-established.
Aldi sells no eggs at first
The group of companies notified this.
It was a pure precautionary measure that no health impairment could continue, said the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have proven to have been tested negatively on fipronile-resistant anti-leafing agents.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers.
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceptive.
And even if you promised anonymousness, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There was simply no consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagment, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, offer employees anonymousness and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow the C-Suite executives to avoid and direct contact the Board of Directors.
"You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to pursue their health, but where is the fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glind, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.
Errett said that she won a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consent results - so you can rebound why.
Companies come to see that you must stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next surface that has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups such as Glind, this wish for an overview is a lucrative business option.
The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Branch could have more than $118.7 billion value in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Fall in miscredit.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized "Puls" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problems.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.
And when the main business leader is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has covered the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or acts unethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boykott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has employed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their company headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.
Well, since the company employs Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by leaders in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic 360 degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Company began to take ethics, values and employees' commitment more seriously in 2002, after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical infringements through the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "Social Media came to their right" that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glind and Convercent offer your software as a service, and taxes the companies with repetitive fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that will find the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was increased to $47 million.
Glitzers secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they have so far.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only use.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong to, and that the work you do is worthwhile, they feel more obliged to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are employed and committed.
If the Analytics tools promise third parties to increase commitment and the use of the employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on the employees' commitment is important according to the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take measures.
In fact, if a company asks employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough or not at all, this can raise disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies who have relied too much on the collection of data.
"For if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of that?
And who you don't care about why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, says Errett.
And after the collection of feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose business.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the brown
It's about 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players are entertaining on one side of the team's new exercise fields on the campus.
Some have pulled out their tricot heads and show the back full of welding from the first day of the training camper.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are subscribed to the summer courses will return to their audits after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6:30.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 to meet the players' already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras's six games in Westwood practical exercises.
They are supposed to take 18 exercises during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supports the NCAA's regulation change, even if it adds another point to the player's busy routes.
"We put this enormous load on them three or four days, and it's very challenging," said Mora.
"And they just pushed it, they're puffing on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, given the clear views of its fields, will not be a light task from an adjacent parking space and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of elevated class, which has already been designed with balls of foot, which had a protective network behind a torque.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We'll use our security," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not a long time to think that people rent a room there and then stop recording an exercise.
If you have the video band of an exercise, it's a pretty good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We'll do the best with what we have.
I don't worry too much about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact checking in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false notifications to third-party investigators and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to combat so-called Fake news.
In an opinion on its website, the company said that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to identify possible error messages and to send them to fact verifiers that may show results of the fact assessment from the original article.
Facebook was criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake news, many of which believe that they have also influenced US presidential elections 2016.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French electors flooded with false stories in front of the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started.
"In addition to the knowledge of what stories of fact verifiers from third parties are being challenged, people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the "connected article" and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false messages.
Creating a Comic Roman: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a snail for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaar-like Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says sadly.
"What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Every story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotionally.
"I only responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobians," he says.
"This is his thumbprint!
And letters always smell for smoke, because at that time a fire was burned on because of the light.
For a person who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was with himself.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone who is so struck with old papers that he is supported by National Trust and Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overevaluated my welcome greeting") this seems all too nice to be true.
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyenic heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He migrated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape nurses, gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive he described as "Hundd of years in which Aristoterates said "Oh, throw it on the roof floor".
Diary books, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who possessed: "You might think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to which two families had fought.
Boys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as the starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer' following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the agriturismo of 1381.
"There's a record of a revolt that appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good beginning.
Maybe the two are connected with each other?"
Other stories are solidly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', who tells the story of the Jesuit Father, who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell was represented, who scattered his own burial by filling a shaft with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his sarry was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' Lovely family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty palates, always make debts and spend money on things they could not afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a lot of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise them."
After the end of his operation in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has brought behind a two-week stay in the Finnish desert for a comic Roman over Elemenmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed from nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to deal with the fucking life."
Campaign started: More than 300 years old Marienkapelle obscured in Rhöndorf
With the hiding of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new roof brand (Rundschau from Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
"Too nice for us.
Or?", asked the performers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel.
"We don't really think that (naturally!)," they write on their website that was released yesterday.
"But we use this measure to gain your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
In fact, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action concerns more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
"It is necessary to formulate a sole promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable all-configuration character."
Finally, it stands in competition with other municipalities.
A medium five-digit amount can be charged to the city of Bad Honnef its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year at the beginning of August in Ankara, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirement and transportation at the Office Corps.
That's the way this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the punching attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Stabile, as it was earlier, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The five Vice-Presidents and Ministers for Defence, Interior, Justice and Foreign Affairs were now taking part in the discussions under the chair of the Head of Government.
This means that the civilians were in the YAS in the surcharge.
The government attracts the stricken in the military.
Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the marine were dismissed.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the armies - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a wire tractor of the punch trial.
486 people who are supposed to have been directly involved in the punching trial have been negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the Putsch, Erdogan had referred to the attempt as "God's gift" as he gave him the opportunity to "clean the forces fully".
But does Erdogan really handle the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hurriyet" published an article entitled "Uncomfortable in the military headquarters".
In the General Stage there are concerns about an increasing "Islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the removal of the head-to-head ban on soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
Great cleansing with the army and security forces goes on anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan made another 7395 state servants fire, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were formerly considered to be the masters of the country.
Three times they put their role as guards of the world’s government.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back military power step by step, not least calling on the reform of the European Union.
Former officers say that Erdogan aims to promote the Islamization of armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", a particularly unnamed officer who, after the punch attempt for fear of persecution abroad, was warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and salafists" in a few years.
If that is true, such a development could not leave the nato cold.
Nevertheless, there is doubt in the Alliance after cleanings about the willingness to use the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational abilities are "slow", say Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It provides that legal immigrants should be reduced to 50,000 per year, more stringent rules for the acquisition of visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law is to be discussed in the two Chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do this by changing the way citizens from other countries are spent Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English that have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," said Trump, quoted by the American media.
Ministry wants to renovate route for racing steigshuttle
In the past few months, the future of the race-steig-shuttle has been argued again and again - now it is supposed to go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is to be built on the maroden route on which the tourist train runs.
In order to ensure the future of the Rennsteigshuttle in the long term, according to the Ministry of Transport, construction work on the route is still to begin this year.
"With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country confesses to this most important connection for tourism," said Transport State Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repair of the route amounted to approximately 2.5 million euros.
From this sum, the country takes 75 percent.
The Treaty, on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finally voted, said Sühl.
The Ministry and the Southdoors Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details.
"That's why the schedule, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for an eleven-year period.
In order to order the race-steig-shuttle on December 2017 is to be ordered regularly.
The race-steig-shuttle is a most popular railway link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations for tourists.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
The route is also strongly constructive in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just as you thought it could not get even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are currently a big thing.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest warp and the type of fingernail.
"The people are funny about them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will get to see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey in publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberate human reactions achieved by the artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his convictions, selecting everything from the robot's eye color over the shape of the chest warts up to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing, as many robots have the "Personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot allows its users, for example, to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality," the True Companion website swarms.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods over the day - like real people!
It can be tired, fixed on conversation or it can be "in mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female properties, the incidence of rape, when one comes to a step on Frigid (named here: opposing) Farrah, are most disturbing.
On his website, True Companion Roxxy compared with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxy?" says the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their origin and its increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR observes their increasing popularity, they still remain provisionally on the edge of consumer culture.
But what passes through the edge zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has been proud to have sexually attacked women.
The most dreading aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') is not the graphic images, the swallowed body and the outcast eyes, but the realistic effect of this vision.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with porn star proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they imitate the movement of a real body.
But, brought to the point when it comes to their "Personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
They can't separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that implies independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are delightful slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: Service Girls
Trump's great performance?
He's making Mitt Romney the inception of healthy human understanding
It has become a binary wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US equity have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Harvest Thanksfeest there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump electing relatives.
We all allegedly stricten to put our filter bubbles.
Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousine, a left-right poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republican people in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relativeship, with whom she had fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side.
The dining table is certainly a good thing, but I find it in a further context that this also brings considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disastrous effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "Normalization" and Trump, we refer to the cruel possibility that his mats will no longer throw us off one day.
However, there is an even more terrible long-term scenario in which Trump Republican of the Right wing "normalizes" which suddenly appears to be reasonable in comparison with its standards.
Today, I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the mad - the dog on the car roof, which 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax statement looked) - which both appeared in fact as a very mild crime compared to Trump.
When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy only to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest carousel of the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crunching and the animals twist to look with fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings become old, the Skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not justify the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pump Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big circulation in northern London.
The Central Park Carussell, however, is still a strange magical experience, since two two years old, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compensate the rating with a 15% drinking money - this to buy something over the shop table.
This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is made.
The poor woman in the shop was apologizing, while I was tired of the experience of providing her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved to hospital with breast pain from prison
Pistorius left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts on his wrists, according to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after a appeal by the prosecutor against a first sentence of death.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his friend was a nightly intruder who was hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention to impose this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, which they say is too cautious.
The national prosecution authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius is at risk of increasing his penalty to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberger Schools, the four-defellowers from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the pupils are going to the gymnasium in the future, four to the real school.
School director Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, headed by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken court, but is then released into freedom.
To this end, the coiner Schar led a musical entitled "The Adler in the Hühnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it grow from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chicken, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was broken down, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and escaped.
Afterwards, the classes showed three and four chicken dances in Yvonne Frank's study.
The hens danced with the young gossips that wore cylinders to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school manager Angelika Sitte.
Although the young animal is different from the other young animals (küken), it is part of it.
But he will never be like a chicken.
His determination is to be free.
She wished every four-declarer to feel accepted in his new school.
It followed thanks to the colleagues, the former head of the school Michael Müller, who repeatedly jumps at school shortages, and the parents' representatives.
The chicken time is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She only dismissed her pupils after two years of teaching, because it had been a really great time.
Finally, she could have relied on the four-declarants.
At the end, all students made a song of summer time and holiday time sound.
There was great joy in the children.
For the new school year, eight first classes have already been registered.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal campings in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, informed.
On the morning of August 1st, the police arrested a group of illegal residents in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while a study is currently running.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control of the free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said that the court can impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel vehicles: What the affected people need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should Diesel drivers participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the behaviour of emissions from Euro 5 cars and Euro 6 in part.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt from it.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action compulsory?
No, the distributed software updates are voluntary.
"The obligatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have lure software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofit has been ordered by the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).
How and from when are customers informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the next months, but have not yet specified a precise date.
Daimler has notified that he should report to any affected person.
If there is no inspection, it will be done in its context.
How long should the overall retrofitting take?
"Swer to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on the political pressure.
"Because we have seen, car manufacturers have not acted voluntarily on environmental issues so far."
How long should this update take?
The retrofitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who don't drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would investigate, according to Smetanin.
Does a massive price deterioration of Euro 4 cars now threaten?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But just in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there is no loss of value for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners doesn't want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) gets one of the most popular awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honoraries.
The awards will be given at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will organize a reception and take part in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, acquainted with progressive TV series, had already announced that he would refuse to participate in the Gala.
"New York Times" he said, "This Presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw the funds - and that burdens me."
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her vision.
The Kennedy Centre named after former president John F. Kennedy is the largest cultural establishment in the U.S. capital.
The former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city master, retires next year.
The site is already written - suitable candidates are rare.
For 31 years Wacker has been a city-building master.
And the work still makes him great fun as he teaches in the press conversation.
He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he wonders that no application has completed the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the nearest possible time.
So, taking into account the regular termination periods, there is still enough time to work out.
Since Haslach acts as the lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must provide corresponding conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they could no longer fill them in, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg to consult.
But citizens near the city and it itself are important, says Wacker, who reports a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects have been gathered to look back on Wackers with pride.
"We make the city worthy of life," he is safe about the construction office and his employees.
But there are also varied projects in the future on the agenda: the reconstruction of the former Hukla-Areal and the Niederhofenparkplatz, for example, has emerged.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium auction is still topical.
The latter alone will be charged with around 1.5 million euros, "if we make it right," we estimate Wacker.
"Everything in everything awaits my successor great tasks.
The work here is fun."
Formerly there is great playroom for a city master.
Haslach's own building and gardening could be flexibly reacted to many things.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green plants is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to have "an eye for what fits in", when new buildings are approved, the separate city master emphasizes.
In any case, the city-building master has a high responsibility.
He's builder, "in the end, everything goes over my table."
In the case of care and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (High Building) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (diefbau) has been for 15 years.
Also, that his successor stays long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should, according to the city of Haslach, be able to provide a completed study as a diploma engineer or a Bachelor with architecture and have good expertise in the field of design and construction law.
The City Building Office is subject to high- and low-grade construction, construction planning, basic employment matters, management of urban property, urban farm with Bauhof and urban gardening as well as lower construction law authority including monument protection.
Bike thrown on lines: South Railway locked
According to the police, the previously unknown offenders had threw the blue bike from the track transfer in the Leoben road area (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so much that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male offenders and have been looking for them since the night.
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed near the place of the decade.
"That goes far beyond a bucket," said ÖBB-speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
The person or the offender would have put himself in great danger and also threatened train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant as well as the delay minutes and the costs of rail replacement transport, pönals of the railway customers could also reach the offenders.
Overall, a "relevant" sum had to come out, said the speaker.
The damages were re-established on Friday afternoon, the rail transport on the southern railway line could be carried without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had expired Friday formit day, two of which were related to remote transport.
Good trains did not fall out, but they had delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 meters of upper lines had to be exchanged.
Isolators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate may help to relieve IBD (inflammatory intestinal disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could reduce the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The unhealable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in Britain, causes stomach cramps and bleeding, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While the affected people are usually advised to avoid meat and milk products in order to reduce their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the intestine in order to ensure that harmful microbes who hide themselves in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory intestinal disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their wounds.
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have created a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in Tryptophan promote more tolerant, less inflammatory intestine, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was separated, had not.
It assumed that the difference had to be related to the mues' intestinal robios - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the stomach intestine.
The dummies of the mice were DNA sequenced and six types of bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells, but without missing the mice.
Mäuse were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal robioma and did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
In order to understand the impact of bacteria on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without bacteria - to unreife immune cells that were isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance supporting cells.
When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-milch acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the mice' feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tiptophan levels were half-sealed, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance supporting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach intestine.
It is not known whether trialptophan advents from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high trialptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a genius with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic signed a genius, Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The 40 million pounds of signature from Chelsea began with a win in Dublin, the last season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder roll, when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira formalized according to popularity.
However, Matic had been excluded from the preparatory Asia tour of the Blues and created only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted to improving before the beginning of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lu Kaku started at the Aviva stadium when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a "fantastic work" to fulfill three of his four priority new commitments.
"To get three of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
"I will be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have made great effort."
Boeing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved over the USA in the form of a Dreamliner, which are several thousand kilometers.
The action took 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar umbrellas was the form of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertising.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted into heaven.
New Depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD Chief, socio-democratic Prime Ministers always looked at elections with some concern to Berlin.
No disturbances from the party headquarters, but no counterwind from the covenant - so was the most important desire of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-regulated capitals.
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with counterwind.
It was deep.
And one after another.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once more: Red-Green can't rule reliable," said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the German editorial network (RND).
The surprising resignation of a Green Member has brought the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the country's election, his red-green coalition lost its single-stemm majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green Bundesgeschäftsführer Michael Kellner has asked the Abtrünnige Niedersächsische Grünen-Abgeordnete Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
Transition to CDU means a clear distortion of the elector's will.
Each Twest has to return its mandate immediately," said the Federal Business Manager and election leader of the Greens to the German editorial network (RND).
"All of this must not be true," sighs a SPD voyager, when the new Job Message reaches the party headquarters on Friday.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister-President of Lower Saxony, is there without a governmental majority after the refusal of the Green Members Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD countries associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland-Wahl in March.
A blue eye, more not, calmed the comrades at the time.
After the country day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It became much worse, and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite slipped the party smoothly.
The comrades were tired again in the weeks afterwards.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next depression.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD country crew, lost his Nimbus on that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmony while his city burned.
And because in the crisis communication thereafter he made pretty much wrong everything you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So now also Stephan Weil.
The Dutch Prime Minister has been criticising for a long time because of the VW exhaust gas affairs and its role in the Supervisory Board.
These survey figures were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps just because of this, because of the fact that the past weeks have been increasingly trying to put accents in the covenant.
The endeavour of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz.
They gave him because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
This is because there is no fault on the participant twin of the Lower Saxon Greens in fact.
And schoolz doesn't even.
At times, the comrades therefore strive to keep their own rows closed.
Their wrath is directed towards the Greens, and here, above all, to the abtrinsic Member of the European Parliament.
"It is incomprehensible and democracy-sharing, as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of all others," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party link in the SPD-Bundestagsfraction, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Twesten has been elected to Parliament, not for her person as a direct candidate, but for the national list of the Dutch Greens, according to the Dutch Member.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD-Bundestagsfraction, complains a "undemocratic maneuver".
"The will of voter four years ago was clear: people have made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Dutch SPD as a top candidate to the Bundestagswahl, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the electoral result," Oppermann continued.
He demanded to clarify the backgrounds.
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further promises from the CDU Niedersachsen.
Funds for local core III
Anyone who wants to renovate his house over the years will soon receive support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG were informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back on what happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg had taken up two thirds of the total funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindlers, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is ultimately important to promote interior development and not only to create new building areas.
On April 4th, the Government Bureau of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a restoration area III.
The amount of funding amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 will be from the country, the rest of the municipality Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area now created?
You will investigate where the "real old" houses are, according to Schindler.
However, it also plays a role to renovate in the planned area.
Where appropriate, the borders could be relocated again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the "Social City" federal-country program, in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The key part of the programme is the revival of internal cities, the improvement of living and working conditions, the conservation and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out by object, i.e. per property.
The restoration area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The period of authorisation for the funding has expired since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the inventory would only be carried out, within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will be given a questionnaire.
In November or December, the decision of the Statute is to be taken as far as possible, so that renovations can be started next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each municipality had to carry out the pre-examined investigations.
It is about assessing urban defects and deciding when and to what extent they are renovated.
A reconstruction note will then be entered in the basic book for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key factor in success for the project was the participation of the stakeholders.
That is why there will be questionnaires which can be sent to the citizens postally in the coming weeks and completed until the end of summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot archae", in which it concerns, among other things, the building condition and the rehabilitation prospects.
In the grey questionnaire, the "Haushalts- und Wohnungsbogen", information can be provided on size, division and residents of a living room.
The blue "business arch" must be completed only if business rooms are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time.
In addition, reconstruction measures are not eligible.
Schindler further stressed that the distribution of funding functions according to the "Windhund Principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You couldn't "reserve" any funds for later.
At the end, photographs of the "Ortskern II" project were shown to make the attendants a renovation "suitable".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come home and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip to open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and showfingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by its BioTeq company.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now built in both home and BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House’s decision to fly a navy horror to South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month costs taxpayers, according to the military statements left to the TIME Magazine, up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and senior officers of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine, a fire-fighter car from Wisconsin and a fork switch from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 a.m. for the event at 15 p.m. and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 p.m. and 21:00 this evening.
The note adds that, if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the restriction of the service hours, a second team would be required for the return flight.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the safety staff of the unit stayed on the ground at the plane during the time.
The recordings provided to the TIME did not clearly indicate whether at last a second flight crew was necessary.
The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could injure the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this wasn't the case," wrote the commander.
"Some as if you were closed," replied the deputy commander.
The event "Made in America" was referred to by the White House as an official event and had not been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political top tones.
At the event, the President insulted the reform of the health reform in the Senate and promoted efforts to prevent government regulations.
The use of the plane known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo-OP is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft performed taxi services in Melbourne, Florida, in the background of his first campaign, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the president's aircraft by its predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy press secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often run training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to stop the US president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said one official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours on this day for "Non-Presidentship Support Missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took over the load for none of the other requisites presented at the event.
One speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates of the US Ministry of Defense for the financial year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is USD 24.380 per flight hour.
The flight time of the aircraft is 30 minutes from the base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"Determining the cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," said Walters.
"These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual appropriations."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include the personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusions.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present things produced in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of contributing to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
Of course, it is appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver's seat of a fire-fighting car.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and hurried with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tough task
The top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga takes place at the SV's third table of Searchsdorfer.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss arrives in Kiel tomorrow from 11 p.m. to the 3rd Table Searchsdorfer SV.
Despite the fact that after five parties, the top ride of the Second Tennis League has still got the sense of reality.
Team Chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent anyway.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Just on the back positions, I find the team very well."
Class and stability at the Suchsdorfer SV mainly ensure imports from the high north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to inserts in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"That's gonna be hard for us as always.
You also need a good portion of happiness."
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If it is not the German French company currently active at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who plays the tournament in the Czech Liberec will be the first to use this season.
The until now unconquered Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball yesterday with the White Riss of Andrei Vasilevski.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the Alster club, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team again.
If it's not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the trainee stands around Marius Zay fills the box.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump did not work very happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to strengthen the sanctions against Russia.
"In his hat to adopt the law," the Congress packed in a few "conscientious regulations", he guessed.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels shattered against the US proposal.
After all, the proposal is designed to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Since then, investors of the local OMV have been concerned with the construction of the Russian Ostseeleitung Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies.
The Drohkulisse is great.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the Oil Group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to raise the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons stand for his choice.
"The press" has looked at what the Group could resist and which could really hurt him.
Narco's Staff 3 Trailers: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel in the Hit series of Netflix is centered
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix has not been over for a long time.
The series three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first received its first trailer and showed the latest evil weight of the show.
With the third season, DEA has focused its attention on the richest organization of the world's drug trade: the Cali cardel.
Leaded by four powerful Pats, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is the head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type, the American and Colombian law enforcement authorities invites to support the war against drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1st.
Role Back: The city sets 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the Kita lunch table itself.
With fixed contacts for the children and a assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the urban children's days.
On 1 September the city of Krefeld resumes food supplies in the urban children's day facilities (Kitas) in self-regie.
For Sonja Pommerance, Deputy Head of Youth Assistance, this is a good message: "We have all been very happy".
The cooking continues outside the house: A caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly chilled.
The city operates 46 children's days in the Krefelder area, in 44 children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past Cita year, 2800 children were sitting at the tables each, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 weeks are eating in the Kita for lunch," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also applicable in the 35-hour care when children stay until 14 o'clock."
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September: they warm up the foods provided, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, take part in the meal individually, spend the food, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
"Employees are fixedly assigned to a Kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-groups as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the hour range.
"The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the Kita team," says Pommeranz zufrieden.
"So they are much more integrated and it is easier for the kita guide to implement educational concepts."
For it is also about healthy diet and cooking lessons.
"The children should help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful.
Also for the children.
"You have a well-known force in the Kita, a person who is familiar with them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and cuisine service - also has the charm of the quality of the kitchen, which it has demonstrated as the most economically for the city in terms of cost comparison between self-regie and foreign award, says the Press Office.
And this, although 46 part-time forces are re-established.
"But these hours do not fall into weight so much for about 750 people in the educational area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the provinces of the Council. Three women will be candidate for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women fully participate and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have published threats to a election process that coincides with the transition of international fighting negotiations to a consultative role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be given the power peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women from totally registered 3.6 million voters were registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl.
According to the police information, the men spoke to the 13-year-old who had been with friends on the Colping Street at 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to call with the girl's phone.
But the 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with her friends.
As a result, one of the offenders tried to grab the cell phone and the necklace of the girl, but that was wrong.
The duo fled without a peacock.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are running.
GMB concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union wants to make sure by Biskuit manufacturer McVisie's managers of the long-term commitment to production in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he had invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be "the first to experience" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's branch manager, GMB Scotland McVitie's requested "Remember that the financing for modernisation of production lines is not being promoted".
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can't gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and workers are strongly focused on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for man-worthy employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in the background of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flourishing production presence at McVitie".
One speaker from Pladis said: "The branch leader at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly, as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and unsafe economic climate, we are continually reviewing our businesses - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility. If our business processes change at the site, employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let down in her persecution by Neymar after she has issued a offer of £ 189 million to trigger its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the World Record Surgery?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record to more than the double of the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the past season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world's highest-paid professional sportsman. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan Board is that the club has always given its best to take care of it since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG middle field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its offers for Neymar.
Roller overthrown and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately threw a roller cast in the Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus put on the clothing of the vehicle damage of more than 200 euros.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
For an accident on B 215 between Stolzenau and Reade, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car came to him on his road, the driver of a VW touran had to escape and touched the guide plank.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum, with his VW at 19.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau, was on the way to Reade.
In the area of the local surroundings of Stolzenau, a car came to him on his trail, so he had to disappear right.
The touran driver touched the guide plank.
The car was damaged.
The driver of the incoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overwhelmed a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident.
According to the accident damaged person, it can be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report discharges Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuses discharges Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
That's what author and historian Michael Hesemann meant.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesperson of the Reformation movement "We are Church", said after publishing to the German Press Agency, he expects an excuse from the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritated Pope Benedikt XVI.
It would be very good for the Catholic Church to say that Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regrets about their own neglects or their false assessment of the events at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticized that the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen was measured with "two dimensions".
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned, no one doubts that it is "shameful and shameful deeds" that should be punished and prevented in the future; but be the "Grad mediale manipulation", says author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee.
"The custom of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to think it is normal," says Scaraffia.
Forstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian radio: "You like to go to the church and this is a found eating."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "beatings were a very normal educational means" "to cope with freaky children as I was one."
It finds it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, for the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared.
Completely wrong, writer and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memorial band "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he deals with the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-sided report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber, which was commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg with the information?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s.
The final report relates to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "It can therefore be summaryed that Domkapellmeister R. used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases.
Especially in the case of high emotion, the punishment for the pupils could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accusers, many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even connect positive memories with him, despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was in his opinion discharged.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidences of Violence to Protectives in the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many pupils highlight his "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholericist and perfectionist, who became handmade to the occasion when a cathedral passes musically did not bring top performance.
How did you become his biograph this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440 pages of a report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He is devoted to eight sides, and he is clearly freed from any suspicion of intermediate or fellow-science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excess of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of effect.
At all events, one can accuse him, learn of it too late, or have not taken the first statements seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by practically all the respondents as "so literally" redemption, "heaven" and "better world".
In the same way, the wide majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents an excellent testimony, describes him as "heartful", "beloved", "righteous", "competent" and "conscious" as an extremely kind teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and bonuses and was "everything of grapes of children".
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotion, which also once led to outbreaks of anger.
That he not only knocked with chairs and threw the key covenant on the ground, but also distributed ear figs and pulled all too freaky boys on the hair or ears, he himself admitted, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
It must be said, however, that such methods of education were widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in the case of parents as in the case of teachers.
Do you remember such discipline methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a worldly school, a state gymnasium.
Compared to what this report actually concerns, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the violence excretions at the preschool, it is naturally a bagatile.
There is a question whether it is not more likely to deal with his acquaintance and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just crashed on him.
The Bavarian Pope is still working hard on many who never understood him.
The truth, however, is: The report deploys Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
The media reported a lot about abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen in connection with the report.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also burdened on any processing or fellowship in terms of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Very no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claim to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were dedicated.
"I never believed to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one interested person deputy for the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in clarifying sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent from shame.
If they did not even entrust parents and siblings, certainly not a choir leader who had been a colleague of the offenders in a professional way.
How do the Domspatzen School Ratzinger's role in the misuse?
Michael Hesemann: A pupil in question put it in this way: "As regards sexual abuse ... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had had timely insights and could have stopped the individual offender.
I think it ... it is also really absurd to assume that, in fact, he ... Buben have opened itself more vigorously or clearer or even more than to their parents, internate leaders, trusted teachers etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "The fact that the students concerned in advance and/or their environment were not trusted could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."
So with regard to sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak from any fellowship.
In this way, he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to display.
Therefore, there is no reason to communicate his good name with these horrible crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "Gewaltexzessen" at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is presented in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is a misuse of the report in turn.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence excesses, and, we say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir leader of the Domspatzen.
The whole horrible pedagogics, the cases where boys were shattered and painted by sadist teachers and suffered disgustingly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Arrowyards, where truly scandal conditions must have ruled.
However, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, for he only had the boys faced when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as most of the witnesses emphasize, the theme "preschool" was tabu.
They were only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradiesical" conditions.
What else was on the cathedral gymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: Although there was discipline, there was no sadistic violence.
And that is also true of Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "a lot of victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence".
So, at most, the accusation to have looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported about the conditions at the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself and from the courses at a school where he was just not working and responsible (so the witness) didn't want to hear anything, and then not again around 1993.
Georg Ratzinger closed the ears consistently in front of the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, for in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In this he pointed out that "in the preschool, the punishment is continued to be practiced".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed when squads were long forbidden in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal gray zone, as everyone of us still knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons may have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the allowed limit was truly exceeded.
But you can't say he always looked away.
It's just not true.
Only in 1980 was the abolition of the penalty of schools in Bavaria officially.
Forstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed yes that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "Fall trick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of assessing past things according to today's moral standards.
The prince is right.
But of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was always horrible and not to what was broken out in the preschool of opposition and violence to innocent children's souls, that is far beyond what was then usual.
That's all terrible, and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. to draw ear figs and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburger time did Georg Ratzinger render in the conversations with you for the book "My brother the Pope"?
Was the subject of squash punishment also addressed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book relates to the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict's XVI., tells from his perspective, as the domes played only a side role.
Nevertheless, I do not forget that he led a strict regiment there.
But that must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the need for urgent discipline, it would not have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the up to now known national rainsburger Domspatzen, true European cultural ambassadors and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and Bonbons alone, one makes no big singers and stands in front of every success, whatever field, but always discipline, passion and self-expression.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really met Georg Ratzinger well and always experienced it as wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believed and heart-good people, from whom one cannot imagine that he could do something to do with a fly.
I regularly get to see how many former Domspates still this day, 23 years after his emerition, keep regular contact with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority.
He is grateful for the fact that he has enriched their lives and brought them the world of music.
And that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, surely that could be - but he was also a lovely respectful person to whom they still look up today and who they just worship.
And please, once again quite clear: All that is being suggested to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.
We can be glad that we have survived this time for a long time.
But it is extremely unjust to make a man just because he is prominent and has a even more prominent brother to become a medial sinal goat.
There is the evil intention behind it all too obvious.
Because the report, which has just been published, discharges it.
Now, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great earnings and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps not yet Germany would finally let anyone know the Regensburger Domspatzen in peace.
