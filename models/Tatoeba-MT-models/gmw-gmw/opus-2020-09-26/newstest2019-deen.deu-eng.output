DFB Chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently does not see a basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that one comes into the conversation that one also talks with him about why he apparently felt this as it was laid down in his statement," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the "Image-Zeitung.
Despite the debate about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued playing for Germany.
I have also assumed that this would be the case until a certain time," said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had explained his resignation from the DFB team in July and also founded it that Grindel had not defended him against racist opposition during the World Cup.
The DFB Chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn't want to build pressure, but he knows it from the football so that if "you leave a team or change a club that you talk about it with your coach and I find it bad that this conversation has not been done so far."
Linz: Garden cottage in Schrebergartensiedlung burnt
At 14.13 a.m., the Professional Firefire Linz was alarmed to a fire in Angerhofweg.
Because a high voltage line leads directly through the scream species settlement, danger was in decay.
The professional firefighter drove out and found the hut in full fire when it arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically to the heel and fire shutt to the necessary extent.
According to the owners of the burning garden hut, he had set up an battery for loading at noon.
That might be the cause of fire.
In any event, the charging device was the largest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire must still be determined - as well as the cause of fire.
However, he should be significant, for the owner had many collectors in his garden cottage.
Wounding mother resents: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open road
What has Lindsay Lohan just driven to this very strange action?
She apparently wanted to break out the children from a alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") himself streamed live as she apparently wanted to break the children from a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial average of the stream.
Here you can see "To luck kisses" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan is experiencing from a car and goes to a perhaps homeless family that she wants to be a refugee family from Syria.
When the family fled before the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
It claims the adults to trade in children.
For all this, she does not provide evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this right now," Lohan is listening in the video as she continues to track the family along the road.
Apparently, she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the apparently angry mother seems to be enough.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an ear fig.
Under tears, the actress then defends how shocked she is - and she keeps her cheek.
What Lohan has moved to this action is currently totally unclear.

Protests in Brazil against legal populists Bolsonaro.
"Ele Nao" ("The Not") is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood is divided in the country.
Thousands went to the street in several cities to protest against the legal populist Jair Bolsonaro.

Audi: "Dieselgate" work takes longer than planned
"The diesel task force is still available," said development director Peter Mertens to the industry magazine "Autowoche".
The detained and imprisoned Audi Chief Rupert Stadler had announced in December 2017 that the task force will be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all motor/driven combinations are expected to be tested," he said at the time.
Mertens said now: "In the beginning of July, we have achieved an important goal in the preparation of this ceremony.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel candal at the Audi Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the automobile manufacturer had made "great organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
On Friday, the VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future and will continue to discuss this Tuesday.
The investigation authorities shall propose to the Audi Chief to have authorised the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust gas values after notification of exhaust fraud.
He knew or consciously ignored the manipulations.
Currently, Sales Board Bram Schot leads the company as the Head of Commissaris.
Because of the conversion to the new exhaust and consumption test standard WLTP there are production losses at Audi, Schot said the "Heilbronn voice".
Basically, he sees a diminishing demand for Limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment in itself is difficult," he said.
Shoot is on electrical mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations are already available.
Grindel strives for re-establishment - Lahm is supposed to go to the DFB presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to join again for the office as DFB President, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup out and the Özil-affair in the following year.
"I make my work and try to make them as good as it is," said Grindel as a guest on the early Sunday morning at the "current sports studio" of the ZDF.
You always have to try to re-elect, I'll do that.
And then you have to watch if the support is there.
The head of the Association finds it "remarkable" in his own words, if he would not have "delighted to cooperate with the future project" after the supplement for the 2024 football project.
Grindel has been the successor of Wolfgang Niersbach, who has been thrown over the summer fairs since April 2016.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first complete term of office of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB Bundestag on 27 September 2019.
The future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to cooperate according to Grindel at the DFB presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues at the Bureau agreed that he will also be advised in this role in the Bureau in the future and then, of course, welcomed to provide his experience with sporting questions," Grindel said.
In speculations whether lame could become his successor as DFB chief, he didn't want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that a national player should be a DFB’s embassy without a migration background.
Currently, this office of the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, has family roots in Cameroon.
"If there is one without a migration background that clearly works into society and soccer and says that "the topic is important, then we have to take care of," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on site where integration needs to work," said Grindel.

Erdoğan opens Moschee in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Moschee in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Kanzler Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day visit.
Criticism to Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan urged the German government to deliver live trailers to the Gulf Movement in Germany and proceed against Kurdish Separatists.
We'll protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathisers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shaken our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib-Moschee, the city centre of Cologne had been partially locked.
Several thousand policemen were in use - among them also shaft guards.

"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrufe and Shrecksecology
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have promoted more commitment to fighting poverty and disease at a joint concert in the New York Central Park.
"Engages you wherever you can," said Mendes at the festival at the night to Sunday around 60,0000 viewers.
Thank you for coming here, that's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I sweat, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Also actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and aid organisations were shown at the multi-hour spectacle on stage.
In the meantime, however, there was a horror sec, when many spectators held the noise of a decaying metal locking for shots, became afraid and tried to escape.
Shortly panic came about, people ran through each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people from the stage.
"Nobody's trying to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all in security.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were free of charge on the Internet as each year.
Anyone who wanted to be a father had to read and spread texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were jubilees and applause - Buhrufe for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
This one, together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, spoke on the stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake expressed himself as judge at the Supreme Court in the U.S. Judicial Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, and thus pushed many women to the head.
At least three women have raised abuse accusations to attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which rejects them.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the allegations, after two women, according to their own data, had experienced sexual offences themselves, on the way to the committee meeting in a elevator.
"You can also meet with me at any time in a elevator," said Flake at the concert in New York.
Press Freedom: Federal Government defends rumor from the journalist
Registrar Steffen Seibert has defended the rumor of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had moved a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, wasn't the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption of the expiry of the press conference.
The action of the journalist has created a strong unrest, which is not acceptable.
He caused people's protectors to bring the man out.
Seibert said that it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellor Office.
This applies entirely regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are proclaimed spying activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah-golen movement.
The Turkish leadership makes the movement responsible for the failed punch attempt on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are threatening several decades of imprisonment.
Foreign journalists are also uncertain before the Turkish authorities: First in early September, Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.
Lastly, the cases of detained journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had provided for reputation.
Although they came free and were able to return to Germany, they still run processes against the two in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-looking, his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for moisture-fruited conversations at the theke of the Hamburg harbour puppet "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller, with her guests, stirs on some beer, some wine or even higher drinks to lock up the mood and tongues.
Many promis also drink courage for the mandatory vocals.
On Friday another episode of the popular Talkshow was recorded.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Menhearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Oilest Day".
The Munich tour to the high north did not get good at all.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, the eyes only two small slices.
The bed-selfie shows a completely excited florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
To his fans he posted some - probably not quite serious - insights that he has now gained: "Line one: never go to Ina's night.
Rule two: Never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round of Eierlikör, the Ina smells at half three, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is indeed written to the 43-year-old.
His fans posted just a few tips on fighting the wounds.
They ranged from instant breeches, fish breads or - probably most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply enjoyed the view of the usual attractive cinema.
As Ina Müller survived the nightly surgery, so far is not known.
But since she has moderated the TV fun at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be more probable...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight with vandalism and unhappiness
The entry into the 36 kilometres long train bike path in the Red cakesland in Treysa presents itself hard to find and clever.
Recipes against growing vandalism are searched, but solutions are hardly distinct.
Shears, cigarette chickens, garbage and unhappiness, demolished trash and now dismantled signs - so long ago, the entrance with a group of seats to the bike path on the Haaße Hill in Treysa has been presented.
For the shower object railway bike path in the red cakeland a more than unfamiliar view.
The theme has been addressed by members of the ADFC local group of Schwalmstadt, but also by others, according to the cycling officer of the city Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling board.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from relocation of the seating group to regular disposal of waste containers and cleaning of the surfaces at the starting point.
"I think that the latter would be the command of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced to the local council.
Not only the garbage drives cyclists and residents - the seating group is a regular meeting point on weekends.
It is not only a lot of noise, but also a destruction of the layers: pedestrians crushed out of the earth, trash demolished, skulls knocked down, seat furniture shattered.
Volunteers had already cleared up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drops on the hot stone.
They are angry that the Rastplatz on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for surgery.
"With the entire bike path, this is clearly the focus of the Haaße hill," confirms the cycling officer, who now also cares for the new cycling site in goats' sharks, which is opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it becomes really expensive."
Another idea is a video surveillance at the hill: "It may significantly increase the threshold to grasp common goods.
This would, however, presume that a police strip will be over the next time.
In principle, deserthagen wishes to develop the Haaße Hill.
It needs to be more attractive.
With the frequency of the bike path you could be very satisfied so far.
The tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our bike path is very high in comparison to others in Germany," said the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert estimates the situation in the Asheröder Straße in Treysa as an extremely critical danger point.
There's no breach on the Haase hill.
In the case of regular traffic, cyclists may have to wait in the middle of the road between two-sided traffic flow," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but well for older people and especially for children.
Music competition at the Cultural Station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music competition was a success, creative and together.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the town's part-offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music competition for big and small, young and experienced musicians".
A competition "with eye swindling in the sympathic Hiltruper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family companion with coffee and cakes from the honourable officials of the cultural station.
Seven formations occurred, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Himig, a long albachtener living in Hiltrup, the nine of the "Hiltrup star colors", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, an ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the blackies.
This competition, according to district mayor Joachim Schmidt, is a new one.
We haven't seen that in other parts of the city.
What were the texts associated with?
The Hiltruper Lake and the market hall were particularly commonly mentioned in the places.
Rolf Himig circulated the Allee in his beat-like song to the "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Cultural Railway Station was also recognized.
It was repeatedly about the experience of each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short reconstruction breaks with short interviews with the artists or hints about their creation.
It was learned from Humberg that he actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
From the sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke knew to report that he was youngest in Ludwigshafen - at a big event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has placed all the way on Youtube.
"It's not about winning," Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was something special for the jury's favorites - so that others can also hear their songs.
A whole CD can play Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with Tontechniker Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Himig with his Hiltrup camp, who especially impressed Franke with his musicality, and the "Lummerland Rudle": "a very beautiful appearance" with ten children and two educators to guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone, the children came to the finale again - and even sounded "right well" without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, entrance to the melody and recognising value.
The jury belonged to Gisbert Keller from the West Fälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß vom KvG-Gymnasium und Oliver Ahlers vom Wirtschaftsbund, and Jan Kaven, Chairman of the district office.
The district office had launched the event on the occasion of their ten-year-old existence.
She appreciated the event as a full success.
All are "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" in the soon very full cultural train station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that are opposite each other.
For each page there is a screen, in which four cards with keywords that you - the old trick with the red foil - can only decrypt when you put them in.
This ensures that the opposite side cannot read anything from mistake.
On the maps, for example, you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2nd window.
3rd dice.
4. Fighting."
These are the terms it has to be used to encrypt.
Because it is not supposed to guess the terms here, but codes.
Alternatively, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card on which maybe is "3.4.2".
In "Decrypto" it is not to be advised the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: In this order and in this example, he should describe the terms "worms", "feast" and "windows" - so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team as far as possible, because it wins the party if it manages to knock the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads loudly: "Wurf" for the dice, "Lose" as a contrast to the festival; here, of course, something like "Party" would also be possible and "Prag" because he took care of the school and knows the window turz there.
So it's going round for round, team for team.
Although you do not know the words of the opposite side - they can better unite with any hint given by the encryptor there.
Possibly mysterious, but not too rotated, the descriptions should be so, otherwise one makes it unnecessarily hard to his team.
The most cryptic to "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rule book.
The fellow players probably have to study it quite long and extensively until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has released will be fascinated how much feeling is in this seeming game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as clever as predecessors and genre primus "codenames", which also stumbles an agent theme on a game of few words, but for which it is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever's only about guessing and not about victory points, it can also easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Hitler greeting and harassing guests in the Kneipe
A 48-year-old man employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night from Saturday to Sunday twice.
He first showed Hitler's greeting in the Upper Town of a passing police strip, later he also fell in the Upper Town in a peasant when he harassed other guests.
After clearly alcoholized, he had to spend the night at the Kulmbach police inspection in the prison cell.
In a sober state, it must then also rely on criminal responsibility for the use of statutory marks of unlawful organisations.
Company Pressig was home to the Schubs
For decades, the railway plant in Pressig was the rotary disc in the Frankenwald.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffer knocked on buffers, it was heard in all pressig," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn't raise anyone.
The brakes also quieted and knatched the cars.
It was just a clean railroad.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkels Home Pressig.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald was a place thus characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergbahn northwards, which, after an increase by about 220 meters of height, has its shelter point in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, trains and shocks were needed earlier, who had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway plant with 21 locomotives, apprenticeship, driving and railway championship.
"Herzstück was the turning disc, which had a diameter of 18 meters after 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and 47 years of professional trainers.
In 1968, Bamberg was operated by Bamberg, Pressig, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - northern part of the railway station.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in Pressig.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimised the need for train and shock blocks.
From 1977 onwards they were only used in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10 000 weights were placed in the month.
In 1982, parts of the plant were canceled, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that one has not taken into account a better use of the site, even in terms of freight transport".
On Pentecost 1989, the Nürnberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary "50 years Electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" a pumping station festival in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," George Dinkel recalls.
It's a little later.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were deducted, the Pressig Rangerbahnhof was history.
"The Rangers and shirt shoe arms performed the most difficult work in train traffic," recalls Dinkel.
Every failure had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rotenkirchen station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current pictures are available here in the InfrankenPlus article.
Kerber with success at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round at the tennis tournament in Beijing as before.
Kerber victoryed the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French woman Kristina Mladenovic.
Next opponent of the third world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakh, or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemundled led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian set up at number 13.
The swab now gets to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
A special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach during the series "Kunst und Genuss".
With great relief registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when the "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the open ground of the property Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the roof of the Tourism Association "Rund ums Walberla" under the series "Art and Enjoy".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large visitor's appeal showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He himself has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as a main organizer and artist.
Somewhat surprising but Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his job in proven, young hands with good prospects for the future.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of the artists and co-designed Flyer.
This year there is again a 70 cent special letter brand designed by them on the occasion of art & enjoyment, available at every art station.
This year's poster "dance out" can also be purchased by Volker Hahn for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high appeal of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler could be won from Nuremberg for the musical framement.
At the way through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses playfulness.
They are artworks made of metal or ceramic, often with colourful accents.
At the entrance of the property, the visitor awaits on the right side of the "Glücksbaum" by artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, colourfully brightened, playful with 20 wind wheels, 24 hub irons and 24 alu tubes equipped as a soundpiece.
With the shiny sun in the background, the object works fairy and invites you to stay.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, which is preferred in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts, in the wind in motion.
On halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heaven Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" for grinding through the versatile art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate 50th birthday festival
1968 - that was the time of protest and student movement.
And the Albachtens at that time also made their unhappiness air.
At least five of them.
They did not want partout to find out that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more sinful life in the district.
In the meantime, it has become a legend: at a bank in the tinbush, they lifted the MGV 68 albachts from baptism.
It was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary was celebrated in the "Haus der Begegnung".
"It will be full today," said president Jürgen Holstiege, and he should keep right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
They had once again revived the foundation festival for an anniversary.
It was tradition for years, then there was a break.
The festival of tradition was back to the 50th anniversary.
An elegant ball was asked before for festive clothing.
The guests were not sitting in the "house of meeting" in seating rows, but cozy at tables.
In the meantime, movement was demanded: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln attracted the controllers and asked for the dance surface.
Honor that the singers of the MGV 68 Albachten themselves made the voice sound.
Consistent with the occasion, happy songs were said.
Almost set: "So a day, as beautiful as today."

Again, the choir leadership of Richard Homann, who was one of the five who were in the tin boss at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his direction," Holstiege said, "he has such a light way, it's a masterpiece that he performs." Moreover, this time, not only men presented themselves singing.
The ladies' choir "Hohes C" was also a guest whose repertoire includes Evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.

Volleyball: 3. League Women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three victories - the reserve of the USC Münster under screen domination of Axel Büring is quite well right in Liga three.
No trace of shy or frack souses, the independents make their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee quite good.
"That wasn't glass clear, but we have already left impression," says the somewhat satisfied trainer.
BWA-Coach Kai Annacker agreed immediately: "This is a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied."
In the evening at a later birthday celebration of Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game cut off.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical deception.
In the third sentence the guests had a sentence ball.
"When they bring it to the goal, such a game can chicken," Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its rustinized forces and brought the full exploitation into the goal.
"We all know who is in such a Derby on the other side.
That doesn't break us the nick.
I have seen quite good volleyball phases," Annacker did not have the 0:3 - and immediately passed to the agenda.
Where the journey goes for the Independents, after just three games seems not to be foreseen.
"It's just too early for that," says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The third league has an incredibly good level.
This is not nearly comparable with regional liga volleyball." In the fourth league, they do not want to look down again.
If the West is not polluted in the next weeks, they must look up.
However, a first balance can only be drawn after ten, eleven parties.
On Saturday it will go to Emlichheim.
Aasee takes place in Essen on 14 October.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "dreamship" Heide Keller became a star.
Now she speaks openly about that the series could have had a co-debt to her marriage out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role of Ledebur's Chefhostess Beatrice on the "Traumschiff" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 01, 2018, she went off board forever.
The series that made her become a star could be responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she was married for ten years.
"This could have been a reason too.
Because I was grown up with this work, traveled with a suitcase alone around the world and many of my admired colleagues perceived me at eyes' height," Keller says in conversation with the "Image on Sunday".
First of all, she was only "the woman of Hans von Borsody", but this changed with the "dreaming ship".
Because now the journalists only called to Heide Keller.
"Whether he liked it so well, I don't know."
She thinks it was possible that her husband at that time could have been quite envy, but "as many men also shook Hans talks about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "the only right one and he didn't want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I've adjusted myself," as she continues to explain.
She always felt "not to be good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman that I was never in truth, even though I sometimes appeared freaky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "because I was afraid that it could also be wrong a second time."
On the day before the government wedding, I was crying in the wardrobe and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage of Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
The love of cellars at that time was "as presented in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I got too naïve to love."
The night-falter, which regularly explores the nightlife of the city in the NZZ-Ressort Zurich, has waited this time to the ZFF opening party.
Our moth is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the cruel shine, in which a green carpet is immersed on the six-eye square, blends it over a fee.
But it's still film festival, there's more or less celebrities in the light of the light.
So on this late Thursday evening, he twists over the place to make it easier to get in the "Aquaclean-WC-Oase" short.
This is the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: the need facility in the parterre of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to flow a luxurious ambience.
But this evening it stinks in the Lord's Oasis for any reason to heaven.
So get out of here, across the other street side: invited guests who have just held in the film next to the opening film "Green Book" at the best level, celebrate the beginning of the festival each year with a party in the three-storey commodity house.
Their name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown are known to come from the entire earthball.
What should not be done in an article about this festival so that it does not fall into slack advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The falter binds a bundle around the feelings that have put him a good feather, and two bully doorsteers actually wind him in generously.
Inside the invites, they dance far after midnight to live music or can be suggested by DJ rhythms to which they scream each other, and rinse down with Cupli exquisite caps.
In the delicatessenladen in the souterrain, oysters are waiting for squeezing mounds, next to the incomparable turtle ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut up, a chocolate fountain is sprouted.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without big losses.
You must love this country for it!
The Falter studys the sign at the roller staircase: "Trage a long dress, please be careful on the roller staircase."
If the two separate instructions were, he would be in the dress code.
But it's rather a conditional construction, and it certainly saved life already.
In the household goods department on the top floor, the poultryman kicks a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink is not compelling for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been thrilling for this brand for years, isn't here in the evening either.
However, between local prominence, cassen table and kitchen items, a face that is known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, director of the opening film.
It's probably not his main actor.
And really: In the same way, Viggo Mortensen, with soon sixty almost like a choirnabe acting, walks through the crowd.
He's not arrogated, not arranged, it's been stolen at most.
Just for this retention, like misunderstood as constance, love international stars of this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dance
Trainer and ex football star Diego Maradona are pleased with the victory of his team.
Argentina's football-league Diego Maradona seems to have lived well in his new homeland Mexico.
After a 2:0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old trainer danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rides, as can be seen in a video published on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member Maradona dances in the yellow-coloured tricot, fired by the players.

Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Send to Last Minutes Pipe "Destroyed on the Soil"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball party ASV, could hardly say it: "So a bitter defeat." His shelters were "devastated on the ground" after the unhappy 29:30 (12:14) - Pleite - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
As in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst, they hadn't played badly in a wide range of phases, the senders.
Only the starting phase "we have totally slept," the ASV trainer was angry.
The housemen quickly carried with 8:1, also the early expiry that Bieletzki had taken, did not produce fruit at first.
"Then, however, suddenly a back through the team," Bieletzki summarized the second quarter hour.
At the break, the residue was only two more gates.
Especially Sendens Bester, Marius Hintze, met one another time in the phase.
After the change it became even better even from visitor's viewpoint.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst liked at 15:15, then the seasonal switcher almost carried out.
Four minutes before the sirene, the advance was still apparently calming three hits (29:26).
And then?
Include the impartials in the event.
Bieletzki usually avoids seeking the debt in others.
But: The 120-second-time penalty, the Steffen Mühlhoff collected, "was a joke."
LIT had good laughing and met four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys have fought greatly, also stood well at the back of seven men and thrown them back to the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now a fucking victory has to come here," says Bieletzki, who is not a man.
ASV tower: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schllögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kemper (2), Mühlhoff (2), Pol (2).
Highing (1).
Bavaria: Missing woman for 30 years - Police digging for body parts

The results of the excavations should be announced during the afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows what dangers are watching in the network.
However, users themselves can also provide additional security.
Instead of complicated letter sequences, users should prefer to use passphrases to secure their accounts in the network.
Additionally, security updates, for example for Windows, should be installed quickly, nor does it harm to equip computers with an anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatening withdrawal as the head of the milliard-hearted company.
He and the US Stock Exchange Supervisory SEC submitted an extra-judicial dispute on misleading Twitter news in which Musk could have lost permission to lead stock noted companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla pay each $20 million, and Musk also issued the office of the Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the German Supervisory Board.

He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7th, Musk wrote his more than 22 million Twitter trailers, he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay 420 dollars per share that the financing was secured.
This would have been assessed by a total of $72 billion.
Later, Musk ran back: Tesla stays on the stock exchange.
After the agreement, Tesla must now find an outside Chairman, set up two independent board members and set up a committee that monitors Musks communication.

Surveys: 46 percent do not want Merkel until 2021 as Chancellor
After the crossings of the past weeks, the GrossKo collects several survey depths.
The SPD falls back in a survey behind the AfD - Angela Merkel is critically seen.
Berlin - The AfD has overwhelmed the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday all over the country for the first time.
In the weekly survey of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases a counter to 17 percent, the SPD gives a point compared to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens reach 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestagswahl on Sunday, the Government Partys SPD, CDU and CSU would, according to Emnid, only get 43 percent of the votes together.
This is why the great coalition has currently lost the majority of all major research institutes, except Allensbach, in the Sunday question.
The governmental parties are constantly reaching 43 to 45 percent of the votes (allerbach: 51 percent).
At the 2017 Bundestagswahl, they received 53.4 percent together.
The bandwidth is also large among the other parties: the AfD, in several surveys, is the second strongest party to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reach voting shares from 12,5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, and FDP is 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such surveys have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down depending on the proportion of votes.
But also the restraint for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has fallen significantly since the Bundestagswahl 2017.
At present, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the Office of Chancellor, as the Emnid survey on behalf of the BamS revealed.
Only every second (50 percent) suggests that the survey is present that the large coalition holds up to the next regular Bundestagswahl in three years, 41 percent are for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there had been significant popularity losses for Merkel.
The Germans also evaluate splits whether Merkel should be again candidate for the CDU Chair in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are for it, 44 percent against it.
Accordingly, 64 percent of the Union's supporters do not want a candidateship, 35 percent.
Slope at Aldi: Price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi going to Tender 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tender there are no more romantic know-how stories - the one should talk with Aldi about puten meat.
Munich - In times of digital "Fastfood Dating" by Tender and Co., the supermarket is almost an anachronistic romantic as a place of knowledge for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced peat meat, boxer short cuts on the wool table or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The App Tender is in the reputation to be less a contact, but rather a sloppy stock exchange.
We have dared the test: how do women react, you don't talk long around the hot breeze in the first message?
Here's the amazing result.
Regular Hollywood-Lovestory-Potential has it when the love happiness precedes an out-the-eye-lost-and-recovered plot.
If the type is also reported under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de in his worship, it sounds very well to Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and Consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this Annonce in an unknown Aldi branch that she will also find her dreamman, with whom she has talked about the "30 percent reduced bio-pute meat".
She deserved her Happy End à la Hollywood for the faith in the magic of analogue knowledge.

Football: District Liga: Researchers' performance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments during this young season, Alois Fetsch went to the court with the His hard ones.
He, the coach of the Football Districtist VfL Wolbeck, retired (internal) to think about the lack of performance on the green.
Everything's history.
Meanwhile, it's running around the Brandhoveweg again.
Taufrian evidence is the 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the past play time only scratched thin by the rise.
Yeah, I'm very satisfied with the appearance.
"We have made the rooms tight and pressured the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and searched each individual for the party to simply say "Thank you" for so much resistance to the ambitious guests.
The Coach had to make a system switch after 26 minutes.
After Nico Frerich's injuries (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came for him - from the 4-4-2 almost seamless went into a 4-2-3-1, where Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more play shares in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his out (17th), the alternate Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroeh (38th) missed the leadership.
This would almost have been avenged when, in Minute 41, the SCA appeared twice in person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer dangerously in front of the Wolbecker Box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his expertise.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes of 18 meters failed shortly.
After 58 minutes of screaming was too late at a Thewes input.
With the change of Miles Geske, Fetsch left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheines Chris Naberbäumer fell in the 70th minute Robin Westhues, there was an indirect release to the placeholders 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The educated stepped up himself and demonstrated his danger to standards.
Westhues" Thing with the right sleeve struck at the bottom left from view of the shelter - 1:0 (71.).
Twenty minutes to get fucking long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck fought in the 80th minute the leather in the penitentiary was unhappy to hand.
Shit-right Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79.).
Bange minutes had to survive Wolbeck in the final phase, before Geske had the victor on the pus in the 87th minute of 12 meters.
Could have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroeder - Klemke (75th silk), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain rare in business boards
As shown in the report "The Power of the Monoculture", which was officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on Monday, was only 8 percent of the boards on the 1st September.
"Companies will have to stand differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Stiftungs-Geschäftsführer Wiebke Ankersen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male leadership teams - with a few exceptions - are no longer conceivable.
The residue makes the German competitors less versatile, innovative and future-oriented compared.
It's another corporate culture.
The small increase in women's share among German stock exchange companies is also due only to positive impetus in the companies of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the boards are female.
In the previous year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies, in recent years, the women's share stagnated.
Recently 26 women worked in the boards.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will recruit consistent women in the next year - in their own interest," said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement would have signaled that no self-obligation continues to increase the share of "null percent".
Another picture comes from the supervisory boards: On 1 September, the female share was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"As many women were recruited annually for the boards, 40 percent would be achieved in 2023," says the report.
Some even make Miese: luxury cards: Which manufacturer deserves most per car?

This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and economic professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year Ferrari made with each car sold 69,000 Euro operating profit - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only comes around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley, even with every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros profit before interest and taxes EBIT.

The cab driver, the notary and their drivers were seriously injured, as the police told.
The 46-year-old driver of the emergency car had crossed a red ample on Saturday afternoon with blue light and Martinshorn.
He then joined a crossing with the cab that was driving with green.
After the collision, the doctor's car slew against an ample and a tree.
He recorded the passant who died in the accident site.
Passenger driver and taxi driver severely injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be freed from employers.
The also severely injured 29-year-old emergency physician was able to liberate himself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor tried this - but without success.
The three severe injuries were brought to hospitals.
The police determine in close coordination with the Bonner prosecutor who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Mourinho we inconveniently
After the blamable out in the Ligacup, Manchester United is now losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
ManU 1:3 is subject to West Ham United. The way of defeat is still to speak.
Imaginatively, the scene was in the 74th minute, in which the rehealed Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had supposedly brought the Red Devils back into the game.
As they suspected an offside at the Pass of Mark Nobel, all defense players of Manchester stood standing and read Arnautovic all the time around the world to shoot the ball by the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a previously inadequate performance over wide distances.
At the moment, the cozy situation at Uniteds Stadtrivale Manchester City is quite different.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho's large competitor Pep Guardiola came to an approximate 2:0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the Aussenseite's defense lock for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero made sure of the sixth victory in the seventh game after a good hour and a double pass with the former gatekeeper, and thus also for the jump at the table tip.
Liverpool no longer table leader
Three days after the 1-2 low position in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup out, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londons.
The hit of the 27-year-old in the 25-minute stayed until the final phase of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66st minute for Mohamed Salah, did not miss the compensation after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made it better in the 89th minute with his slinger.
So after the reds were started with a flawless balance in the week, Chelsea was not to be beat for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the Remis in the League, the Blues Liverpool was now rushing from the table tip.
Like City, the two London City Clubs also celebrated Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (at Watford) 2:0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, in which Granit Xhaka played, had to wait for a success report to the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford Defender Craig Cathcart buzzed a hereing of Alex Iwobi unfortunately into his own gate, just two minutes later, Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season hit.
As a result of the fifth victory, Arsenal passed to Watford and is newly behind the big Rival Tottenham on rank 5. A strong impression continues to leave uprising Wolverhampton under his Portuguese trainer Espirito Santo.
At 2:0, the clouds remained unnecessary in the League for the fifth time, and the 8th place was occupied.
VW-Kernmark is missing: Paris automotive salon in sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Automobile Salon takes place every two years in Frankfurt on the exchange with the IAA.
Paris - Officially, no topic, but always present: The diesel candal and the ringing for driving bans and retrofitting are not supposed to leave the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 automobile salon, they will show their news from the coming week together with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not actually play a major role in this.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for Diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should still be an important issue at least behind the shining scenes of the exhibition stands.
A great name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first pure electrical models, among other things: The e-tron of the Ingol cities is to come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart 2019.
They were both officially presented.
The iNext of BMW will only start in 2021.
The new 3rd is the centre of Paris.
This year, from 4 to 14 October, more than 250 exhibitors are represented.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle builders as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in each of their own halls.
The exhibition, which celebrates its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in the exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a million visitors came.
During the severe earthquakes and the following tsunami, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are more than 500 injuries.
The island was shocked by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first quake had the strength 5.9, the second the strength 7.4.
Communication and transport connections are damaged, there has been enormous damage.
After the shakings, the tsunami broke into the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds of people had gathered on the beach to a festival.
It is feared that the sacrifices are still significantly higher.
The figures are only from Palu until now.
However, many other municipalities are affected - along the Sulawesis western coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate religious service in Werdohl
Motorcycle passor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final god service for the motorcycle drivers in the Peace Church in Eveking on Sunday with a helper team.
Werdohl - The place in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcycle riders on Sunday.
After all, the Final Divine Service for the Bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor passor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the seelsorgeric concerns of the PS-strong two-wheel drivers.
Between April and September, on the last Sunday of a month, the traditional motorcycle god service (MoGo) takes place at the house Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by bikers in the Peace Church in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bikers met to engage in anything other than ordinary worship.
The Bolids were already set up from 10 o'clock before the entrance portal of the church.
At first, the Biker's early chops were on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a tight curry worst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, also attended.
The sermon held during the Biker-Godsdienst Pfarrer Dirk Grzegorek.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the musical sub-painting.
"Although the bikers prefer the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill is more poetically-sustaining tones," said Pfarrer Frank Schröder.
Also this was certainly a novum in the history of the motorcycle god service yesterday.
Füchtorfer Home Association celebrates big festival: After the apple the milk comes
And also on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pine cakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated his astonishing viewers step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the big trigger.
With a little muscle force, the apples became a finely crushed mass.
Not many of the children have yet been able to imagine how it should be a tasteful drink.
But they could also look at this important work on this late Friday afternoon.
In shapes packed and coated by nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg piled the a little bit like hackleware layer for layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step in the work has not been so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice went gradually into a large vessel.
However, the farmer had already completed specialities.
So he opened his "Schatzkisten" and presented to the older visitors the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was accordingly great.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came into the conversation, while the children could not only follow the process of apple pressing but also discover the built hipburg for themselves.
Also active of the Füchtorf Kameradschaft of former soldiers involved in the festival and invited some stations to short-distance games.
In the following year, the Home Association will also offer an action day.
But then, according to Gregor Krützkamp, the home in the heart of the Spargeldorf will not be the place of events.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: finally, it will go around the milk.
1:4 vs. Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth seasonal plan: "Cause situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat, Trainer André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals of Hannover 96 around themselves and spoke courage to them.
However, there was not a lot of positive things previously to be seen at 1:4 (0:2) of the table last in the event of entry Frankfurt.
"It's a shitty situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler and pushed after: "That's naturally disappointing, because you always take a lot."
The further victoryless Lower Saxony, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) met, stands with two counters completely down and is a descent candidate in its current constitution.
The first season's home victory was held by the Superior Ante Rebic.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59.) and Luka Jovic (89.) achieved the gates for the DFB pocal winner, who, after the successful general sample for the Europe-League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle of the table.
Croatia's Vice World Champion Rebic was almost involved in any dangerous offensive action of Hessen and never managed by Hanover's defense.
The storms hit after the World Cup showed with its pace and perseverance, why he is so valuable for the independence.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan borrowed by the FC Liverpool was the first time in the early formation of the Frankfurters, which began in a vibrant way.
A headball of Lucas Torró (17th) falsified on the gate network was dangerous for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in prospective position at the last moment by the 96-defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term expired Kevin Wimmer.
The leadership for the householders fell almost necessarily and completely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball after a defensive corner into the penitentiary, Haller extended per capita in front of the gate, where Ndicka only needed to hold its foot.
It was the first Bundesligatreffer for the defense player who came in summer by the French second party AJ Auxerre.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time, Haller fitted his storm partner Rebic, who couldn't get through and left 96-Torwart Michael Esser no chance.
In the mid-term, Hannover-Coach responded to the weak imagination of his elephant and brought two new offensive forces into Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
Although the Lower Saxony played a little more courageously in front of it, the inflammatory ideas remained shortly before the end, when the trailer was still successful.
The Hesses were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic started a solo and then placed across De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty gate.
The rest was only for the Frankfurters against overwhelmed guests to run, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a Party Mile
Wurzels Despite cool temperatures, there was good mood at the October festival in the city centre.
The Munich mayor Dieter Reiter created it before millions of public at the opening of the 185.
Municher Wies'n last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geising Christians celebrate Holy-Kreuz-Fest
The Geising Catholics celebrate the Holy Creuz celebration on September 14 or on Sunday afterwards.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then is a procession to the Holy Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Church hosts the shot Christ, who came from the 30-year-old war and on which legend should have shot after a Swedish soldier.
From the shot wound, then blood flowed.
From this a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which led to the construction of the Holy Church.
This is not finished until today, only the altar space stands, the missing longhouse is indicated by the trees.
In his preaching, pastor Adolf Buhl reminds that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Despite the significance of the Geising parish, the worship was badly visited.
After service, the procession to the Holy Church took place and with the final blessing ended the church part of the Crusade.
For many years, the Catholic Church choir has been invited to the Catholic parish home to the worldly part of the festival.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather adapted, farm ice.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered some guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to façade, roof, sandstone work and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will take place until next year.
After the preparation has already been for some time, the damages could be more precisely identified and the individual tenders could be prepared more concretely.
It is sure that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already existed has grown a few years ago, but it has also been found more, which was only possible by the inauguration by means of pruning.
The socks are finished, the natural stone work is still to be started before winter, and it is hoped that the half of these works will be completed this year.
Indication: New residential home in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
The Danube-Iller life aid opens a new home for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
The fact that in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" will be handed over to his destination - there were all the attendants agreed at the date of inauguration.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have been living in the home of the Danube-Iller life aid have been dependent on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider passages, hallways and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas, architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army officer building was placed on the test stand for the residents with mobile cap: "The house had arrived in the years and no longer in the equipment," said Bader looking back.
In 2016, the excavators approached to break off the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and brightly as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Nuclear aid Danube-Iller opens new home
About 4.6 million euros invested life aid in new buildings.
The free-state taxed 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450000 euros.
According to Architect Bader, the construction work has remained in the planned framework - both timely and financially.
The managing director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The spagat between a barrier-free and simultaneous fire-proof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many requirements that allowed the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move without any other help.
Similarly, Gertrud Kreutmayer, Head of Social Administration of the district of Schwaben, said: "The house is based on the special needs of its residents, which need aid to be mobile."
The living and functionality were well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real luck, because it is no longer available in today's situation."
In total, the new residential home in the Münsterblickstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three living groups.
Pride is the Leader of Life Assistance Heinz on the eleven full-time forces who are all employed by tariff.
Germany: Silence complains differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of the unity, the deputy SPD-President Manuela Schwesig appealed to all nationals not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that are paining after almost 30 years of unity.
We cannot be satisfied with these differences," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the "day level on Sunday".
The objective must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans in average worked longer than the people in Western Germany but received 15 percent less salary.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after the German unit," said silence.
North Korea: Does this foolish dog end the Korea conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhund is supposed to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In trying to relax in the relationships with Seoul, Pjöngjang gave the South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moons office reported on Sunday, the two about one year old dogs already reached their receiver on Thursday.
They then passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog feed to facilitate the animals' convergence.
The dogs with the thick white skin, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national cultural property of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship had announced the north at the third summit of this year between Moon and the North Korean powerholder Kim Jong On mid-September in Pjöngjang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and apply for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approach, Kim also agreed to close the test system TonVientianeg Ri for missile drives.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months since this year, numerous new books have been published, mostly in response to this question in the back of the past hundred years.
It is quite different to Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director-General of the Austrian State Archive, in the magnificent "Image Book" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New Week, new chance for the government
Back to business work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of the Great Coalition starting today.
A few interviews, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not finally convinced the "return to business" of mantra.
This may have led some craftsmen, physicians, cashier workers and other employed citizens in this country to the legitimate question, which is actually the difference between work and business, but it's drum.
If the Federal Government is now ready to devote itself to its mission - to governance - it should not be dealt with intelligence debates.
Whether Union and SPD, after the provocations and blamages of the last weeks, can actually bring something together, perhaps already show Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties meet with the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early; a doctrine from all the disputes.
First of all, however, with the Diesel Nachrüstungen and the Specialist Immigration Act, conflicting issues are on the agenda again.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to make the car companies with exchange premiums gently escape, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the duty to retrofitting older diesel technically.
While this crisis has marked an approach over the weekend, Union and SPD are still far apart from the planned professional immigration law.
The SPD demands a stay perspective for rejected asylum applicants who work or make a training.
The Union is strictly against the "spurchase change" from the asylum system into the labour market.
So there will be again disputes among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same have been together with the GroKo, but three partners with partly very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a society drawn up by such a variety of, sometimes contradictory interests does not occur.
However, in order to be constructive, disputes must not be rebuilt for party-tactic reasons on the question of being or not.
It's still about politics, not theatre.
Union and SPD should fight – but always have the reality of human life in view.
What is feasible and beneficial to many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the trace change question can be clarified pragmaticly - and thus recover confidence.
Most importantly this is why the People's Partys have to fight now.
Pilz checked working hours at Hartinger
Minister for Fisheries
Does the Minister of Labour infringe the applicable duty law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"Effective day and night" their legists had been working on social security reform, reported a superb social minister at the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
In the case of list-pillar mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) is surprising - she now brings the matter into Parliament via request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm about the use of her team and not to announce any violations of applicable service law before running cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to "promise Har Tinger from any suspicion."
Police rushes up a street in search of women's bodies
Marxgrün - Lange didn't want the police to comment on it.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been buried.
The route is locked until Monday in the Marxgrün area.
It was preceded that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog specially trained for the smell of old human bones was finally able to limit the relevant place to a few meters along with his leader in multiple use.
In addition, together with scientists of the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Memorial Protection Authority in the area of the mentioned road, a ground anomaly was discovered.
For more than a year, State Lawyer and Criminal Police Court have been finishing the losing case.
At Marxgrün, a bike path was repeatedly locked and investigated with sonar devices because the investigators suspect that here, in the course of the new construction of the state road, Heikes body could have been sharpened 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Crafts in Barcelona before Catalonia
On Monday the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be the first time.
But it's already coming to cranes before.
The separatists have not forgotten the autumn 2017 police use.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan Independence referendum of 1 October 2017, it came to collapse between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence advocates, among other things, with colour powder to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the national police and civil warfare.
Around 3,000 police officers from Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to honor their colleagues with an announcement, which last year were in use at the referendum illegally classified in the elections.
At the time of attempting to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to separate the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 separatists would then have tried with violence to break the police chain, and the officials, among other things, were thrown up with color bags and eggs.
Six persons had been arrested that 24 others had been easily injured, it said on appeal to the authorities.
On Monday the independence referendum will be the first time.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split the wealthy region of Spain, the central government in Madrid had made forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president Carles Puigdemont fled into exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also dismissed abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still in the U-have.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the office of the new Catalan government in May, the forced administration was terminated.
But the new regional president Quim Torra also consists of the "right of self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected Ratelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate themselves torlos
Red-white eels continue to take place.
Also at the FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0-undecided.
The final light and the third last they unpopped before 438 viewers in the Heidewald Stadium as a gathered unfairness.
The first half was extremely overviewable by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, if you prefer to pick up a beer or a beer worst, you could do this without concern.
There was no danger of missing a torchance because there was practically none.
First shot after half an hour
For the first (unharmless) torch of the entire party, Slohs Nick Flock signed in the 28th minute.
The best - and, in principle, only real - possibility had the Ahlener, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the penal space limit.
The hosts were even more harmless.
The most effective action was in an early change.
Stürmer Lars Schröder had to be exchanged infringement condition, for Sinan Aygün came.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the ever-increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed almost over the case and after an hour, the goods lovers also appeared openly for the first time.
After a ball victory of Matthew Wieckowicz, it was fixed.
The quickly presented counter via Sinan Aygün "Krönte" Nick Flock (62.) with a but lazy shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, with a headball of Wieckowicz (66th), they retired after a cornerball of the ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim trainer Angelo Daut responded, first brought Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60.) and later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70.).
It did - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlener did not achieve.
Only in the 91st minute Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but the one also didn't bring anything.
Angelo Daut tried to highlight the positive point: "I liked that we played at zero." But unfortunately, the zero also stood in front.
"We weren't as dangerous this time as still against wooden rods and that even though our opponent had no desire to play here," noted RW Ahlen's interim trainers.
Offensively "thought everything such a little" against a team that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn't feel that we could get a countertor," said Daut.
To his suffering, however, as a spectator, they did not feel as if his team could shoot a gate.
The idea was too drought for this.
Reckfelder Harvest Thanks Market: Fortunately there are enough creimers
This welcomes Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Release Station for which these donations are intended.
The Honorary Insurers: "These donations remain also in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky was shiny blue, but the place was still empty, but this was still to change during the day.
Because: "Here it's so fun, that's why we're here today," said a visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a decent prize of humor.
For the couple of Brockmann, who had to be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer entered in the short term.
The Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are enough creimers.
And the "replace" did not take it to talk musically to the ever-increasing visitors.
This was so good that some folk songs were singed at a later hour.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to hold the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is pleased with the many activities with their stands, including most associations.
"Attentionally, there shouldn't be something like a table," he nevertheless thanked for the action of the men'schorus.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were employed at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town gives you a colorful touch - here's something going.
Then, Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took the maize crown with the help of the fire fight and took it to the winter quarter.
Many stands have been worked for the physical welfare.
From sweet to heartfelt everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for a year, was created at his dekupiersooge.
Furnier work, beer bottle with rectangular motifs and a lot more he had in offer.
A speciality offered three rectangles of Imker: "Reckenfelder Honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschluiter.
Last one has another specialty in it.
Honey cakes in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
There the little Elsa had to access again and again, the cake tasted so well.
The sociality is that the visitors stayed for a long time until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Smierries with local policy message: No successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknowns have probably hardly acquire a beneficial way for the construction of a skate plant.
In several places there are smierries, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on request of the WN.
In at least one case, the police have been sentenced for damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark für Lengerich" were punched on signs, among other things, at the Gempt-Halle and at the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, Manager of the Halle, reports that after the professional election fair on September 19, a corresponding lettering on the advertisement plate on the stairway to the Gempt-Bistro had been discovered.
Since the short message appeared to have been left "only" with an Edding, they could be removed easily.
"Some days later, however, it was again there, this time sprayed up," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given just this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also called on the table.
If the skate system is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already promises, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of School, Sports and Culture, without name.
But well possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical with those companies that are on the decorated table.
For years local policy and administration have been dealing with the issue of skate plant.
After the old had been demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council voted for the fire-fighting park.
However, this concern was not implemented - too many factors seemed to be talking against a construction at this point.
At the end of June, there was a turn of turning.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the area of Gutenberg School.
Jürgen Kohne says to the state of things that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning.
The last word was then the city council.
He goes from a decision this year, so that it could be built with a positive votum in 2019.
Closer air traffic control becomes even worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic shaos in summer, German flightlots do not see any signs of improvement in the next year.
"In this year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said the head of the Air Safety Trade Union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency in front of the aviation summit in Hamburg on 5 October.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight failures is the long-standing need of personnel in European airlines, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the next year, but the training of new lotses takes four to five years," said the trade union.
In Europe, the market for finished-trained lotses is empty.
In the centre of Karlsruhe alone to monitor the upper German airspace, about a hundred people were missing.
Maas again criticized that various air traffic trade unions were not invited to the summit.
In the Hansestadt on Friday, representatives of the Bundes, the countries, airlines, airlines and airports meet to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compatibility and overtime, this will not go without us," said the Chief of the GdF, who has many members in the German Federal Aviation Security.
Maas again made EU Commission regulations responsible for the Lotsen Miseres.
The transport forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were much too low.
The cost limits and personnel savings derived from them in the national airlines are now fully tailored to the operational business.
Maas appealed to Bundesverkehrsminister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to take part in Brussels for regulations that "have not yet cut off the air".
At present, EU standards would be voted up to 2024 and there should be fear of further strengthening.
The EU is constantly exposed to lobby pressure from the Airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues now harvest exactly what they have sowed themselves in recent years," said Maas.
He hopes that the high delay cost of airlines initiated rethinking.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Safety Authority (DFS) offers a "advantaged Training and Future Pact", said Maas.
The up to date announced recording of 120 lottery students over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related deductions.
The necessary staff building is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board is voting for Group Reconstruction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans for the reconstruction of the Group.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp Interim Chief Guido Churchhoff, appointed as Chairman at the Sunday session, the cruel group is to be split into two independent societies.
Both companies are supposed to have their seat in food and are noted at the stock exchange.
There should be no additional reduction of staff beyond the already known reductions in the administration.
After two withdrawals, the control body on the capital side counts only eight heads.
Ten representatives of the employees are opposed to this.
The final decision, however, is expected to take a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is intended to include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be bundled with lifts and deliverys.
Barcelona: Violence at Demos of Police and Catalan Independenceists.
Two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona have led to violent conflicts with numerous injuries.
According to the city administration, some 3000 policemen from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6000 advocates of independence.
The Catalan police tried with a great command to keep the two protests away from each other.
According to the staff, independence advocates attempted repeatedly to break the security lock.
They would have attacked the officials with color and throwing floors.
According to the data, there were also between the participants of the various protest trains.
According to Rescue Forces, 24 people were injured.
The police told me there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appraisal of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to honour the colleagues who had been doing almost exactly a year ago against the independence referendum banned by the Spanish central government in Catalonia.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unjust that Catalan and Basque police officials deserve much more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it a provocation that the Spanish police demonstrated in Barcelona.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrant Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they threw us a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name with Daniel, rejected the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our companions who did only their duty last year: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a large European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues had "not come to provoke," the policeman assured.
Panne allowed access to personal data from British Minister
A security gap at a mobile phone app has caused the personal data of ministers and Members of the Conservative British Tory Party to be temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from unknown people after the Panne became known a day before the Tory Party Day in Birmingham.

Football: Juve trainer praises by top party: Ronaldos best game
The Portuguese star storms played "the best game this evening with the half hour of Valencia", commended Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the trainer, the expensively purchased star was also without the own gate of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutor.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and makes it good," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first gate - and from the moment we grew.
Thanks to the three gate templates of Ronaldo, Juve played the game after the early retirement through the hit of Dries Mertens (10. minute) and depended first on the worst persecutor.
The Torjäger collected from Real Madrid initially laid on the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who managed the leadership with a double pack (26./49.).
After a corner by the headball, Ronaldo also worked on the hit of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76.), who had only to push in just before the tower line.
"He gives many templates," praised the trainer.
But of course, Allegri wants to see gates of the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of the record Torschütze.
"We need to be better in serving him," the coach asked.
Best Juve Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, the overpower of Juventus seems to become even more oppressive.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in series A. At 21 points the master of the remaining seven years already has six counters jumping forward on Naples.
The table line trained by the former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti was not unacceptable against Turin.
But at the latest after the reference of the already confused Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to go hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the place.
"We played well against a good naple," commented the Turin Coach.
Emre Can was also allowed to feel there.
The German national player has passed with Juve.
The professional from the FC Liverpool was used in all seven Liga parties.
The middle field actor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, who meant Allegri with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flew from the square at the 2:0 victory of the Turines and was locked for the home game against Young Boys Bern on Tuesday.
Kanye West changes its name
With an extraordinary appearance, Rapper Kanye West took attention at the US TV show "Saturday Night Live" at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume provided for precedence and question marks in the audience.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change on time for the release of his new album.
You may only call him "Ye", the musician says.
"The Being, formerly known as Kanye West," he twittered in response to the deceased singer Prince, when he placed his artist's name.
The pseudonym, however, is not a news.
The tenth album appeared under this name.
In an interview with the radio station KRRL, the artist had explained that "Ye" had a religious significance for him.
"I think "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "yes", says the Rapper.
Football: Kreisliga A1 Münster: Finally!
Awesome!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage made no heal from his disappointment.
That was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was simpler, we have almost never put him in trouble." According to the thin list of Hoetmar's funding options reads.
Degree two torchances in 90 minutes, so you can only rarely make games positive.
Football-Kreisliga A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two possibilities in the first passage, but the first used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to the early lead (7.).
In the 43th minute Steffen Uphus could have increased, but after great preworking by Krause, he was standing free.
The hosts had only a double possibility when Moritz Höne first failed to Torsteher Jo's shoemaker and found his master in the post-shot Jan Blome also in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, guests became more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But uphus (49.), Julian Turl (61.) and Heinz Linnemann (69.) all awarded.
A trading meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the gateline and saw red - Niklas Eilmann could also not use for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide stoke the ball over the line, the party was decided (81.).
"We had criticized ourselves very much before, then it was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90. Leibig), Turl.

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spektakelfootball in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"Then I don't know what to think of it," he rang after words.
"We didn't get any access to the people." He thought he meant the wing vocals with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green whites that were collectively offensive.
However, he could laugh: "A dirty victory," he still said, twinkered and pulled from then His players, on the other hand, was the relief to notice that they had pulled out of the affair with three points.
Well noticed, after a duel of two teams, one of whom, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class support.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was by far our best season performance," he says.
"How we come back after the 0:2 as we keep against one of the top teams of the League over the entire game time, that was already really phenomenal."
The more bitter it is that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season hit (24.).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this gate.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side mustardly for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew that, but such a player can't be taken out completely.
"That was crazy what he did," Lewandowski confessed the opponent's quality.
Shortly before the side change, his own elephant managed to compensate: McGill's left-hand release sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe into the long torch (45.).
After the side change it was again McGill, who achieved the compensation (59.).
Then it went and forth.
It was a cracky, action-loaded game.
Nübel again shocked albachten (64.), only five minutes later Patrick Horstmann seemed like (69.).
Despite the surplus, Albersloh was no longer able to reconcile the last Concordia-Treffer (80.).
We must now focus our full concentration on Wednesday.
"The game against jackets, that's what we have to win now," said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröher (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Tores: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhne (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers around 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Consequently, France's President Emmanuel Macron signaled that he wanted to pick up the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff the term of office was too short: he was not in Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and afterwards, Wulff was a guest there.
Thus, academy director Udo Hahn, who proudly said: "All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors were already with us." That at the Academy in Tutzing Castle always appeared celebrities, but was also a topic in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songmacher Konstantin Wecker participates in a conference on spiritual experience in philosophical perspective, on September 29, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will personally accept the "tolerance prize" awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which also receives TV moderator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The around 80 meetings until mid 2019 have it in itself.
"The pension is not sure!" stands in a meeting title.
"SOS on Europe's borders" - so the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean."
"And to a meeting about Syria: "Barbarei without limit".
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - the war devastates every human idea".
From structural racism in society to the scare between the poor and the empire to the radical change of work by digitization, the spectrum ranges.
Academic director Hahn convinced: "A free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to search for solutions or at least for partial solutions."

Music cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - West Fälische Nachrichten
"Suitable for adults as well as for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christkirche in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret testin, Teubner suggested gender understanding, not only with humor and heart warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and what else may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar set her up and mastered her violin as well.
At the wing, Ben Süverkrupp was sitting.
This is one of the male savings partner who sometimes comes to words until the end of the sentence, one true pianist: So congenially accompanied Süverkrupp Teubner that some may have wanted a solo.
That was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, that's how it fitted to the red thread of the evening.
There Teubner had brought a paradoxone into play: the satisfaction of the man, if he has a partner, but this does not make up the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, does not benefit.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have emerged from the composer Mozart's, "the Nannerl" would have unheartedly opened the door?
Thus, Süverkrumpf passes over in improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" into the "Lied of Death", and from Mozart g-mol symphony into a playful dance.
There were big applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
Flowers handed over Karlheinz Klein, treasurer of the club, the Chansonette.
But the Chairman Heidemarie Brandbeck was not able to take an additional thanks.
She had the idea to give the Duo one in Wolbeck as well as the performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

" Actually, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player has made too many gates.
We haven't managed them," says ASG-Coach Dogan Aydogdu.

"The Mosque opening in Cologne has left a shelter in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be easy to get together," said the Chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, Germany's editorial network.
Both the Turkish and the German side would have missed the chance of a common, comprehensible appearance.

The broad exclusion of the German public has "promoted many reservations".

On 18 October (Dondertag) at 19.30 p.m., the Home Association Nottuln already organizes its fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace of the Old Amtmannei.
It's almost the day exactly then a year ago that we had a folk hit for the first time.

From pure fruitbuilding to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125-year-old existence of the Circular Association for Gardenbuilding and Landpflege was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show at Kulmbach's Vereinshaus, the final incentive for the Circular Association for Gardenbuilding and Landpflege Kulmbach was set, and exactly 125 years later, he celebrated a great anniversary in the city hall of Kulmbach on Saturday evening.
At that time, he was also called another name: "Council of Kulmbach City and Country" was lifted from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-building association was also different from today's work - it was really pure about fruit-growing, about flowers and gardening at that time no one thought.
"At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained Kreisheimpfleger Günter Dippold in his festive lecture.
Fruit trees should take aside distance roads, schools have been built so-called industrial gardens.
Fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which comprise nearly 7000 members.
But with that the spectrum is far from exhausted.
A naturally horticulture, biological plant protection, village beauty and nutrition play an as important role as providing knowledge, a healthy diet and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a garden-building association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "mulws" showed entertaining on stage.
"Youth work is urgently necessary especially in the digital age," said Kreisvorsitzender Günter Reif, and OB Henry Schramm also stressed the importance of experiences in nature for life.
The chestnut collection was a giant thing for us children, I doubt that you can gain similar joy with smartphone & Co..
Sharm promised to plant two trees together with the Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they are to stand, the Circular Association decides", Söllner Landrat added and highlighted the special importance of the gardening associations for the villages.
The circuit association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many gardening clubs in the district, also circular business leaders and specialist consultant Friedhelm Haun made no doubt.
He led the many visitors with an image presentation through the long history of the circuit association and reported, among other things, the need for self-supply after the war.
In the past everything came out of the garden, it was put in for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the farm was transformed into a decorative and residential garden.
"The nature is in existence, it was before us and we have to focus on her," pleaded the specialist for fruit and nut trees.
That is why there is the motivation for the gardening clubs not to let down so that our home is beautiful and worth living.
It also included welcoming the new citizens in our associations, supplemented the President of the Bavarian National Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We have to stop the eclatant decline in insects, we owe our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif closed the successful festival, which was ceremonially surrounded by the towers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada's Foreign Minister moves UN-Rede
Mexico's government wants clarity in matters of Nafta: They make both trading partners an ultimatum for agreement.
Canada's Foreign Minister now gives absolute priority to the trade agreement - and pushes her speech before the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in ringing for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Discussion in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, the minister will only speak on Monday before the United Nations Assembly, her speaker Adam Austen informed.
In the meantime, she concentrates on the renegotiation of Nafta.
On Friday, the Mexican Economic Minister Ildefonso Guajardo explained that the negotiators of Canada and the USA had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wanted to join the trade agreement already concluded between his country and the USA.
The United States and Mexico had agreed in August on a recast of the Nafta Regional Free Trade Agreement.
US President Donald Trump suggested that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The discussions on a new edition have been running for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (local time) they are to be concluded, Trump's government wants to present the agreement before 1 October to the US Senate.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico's designated President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday to seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, left the hospital.
The ex-military ex wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report from the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will observe public events in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked on open road at the beginning of September during a election event in Southern Brazil.
At the same time, in several Brazilian cities, thousands of people went to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "The Not"), women's associations had called protests against the ex-military.
Also in the social networks, the associations against Bolsonaros made racist and female despising statements mobile.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis São Paulo.
In the capital of Brasilia, protests were mixed with an announcement of the presidential candidates of the Brazilian Workers Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He was replaced by Ex-President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and is therefore not allowed to compete.
The presidential election in Brazil is on 7 October.
As ex-burgermaster of the million town of São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro in surveys.
Although the "Trip of Brazil" has been in the political operation for a long time but is presenting itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there is a vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful - no matter who he is in contact with.
Bolsonaro is known for he hates against homosexuals and blacks and glorifies the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He repeatedly shocks with verbal draining.
Another time he said that the trailers of Lulas left working party should be shot.

He sold around three million plates in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is the most sold album in Denmark until today.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen honoured Larsen on Sunday in a statement as "Straßenjungen", which was "in contrast with everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also reminded that the Monarchy opponent Larsen had occurred in 2010 at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: Volume at pressure air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and fire a concert evening with the power of a tiger."Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" make such a description of the rocky live music experience on Saturday evening in the room of the Citizen Center Shoes Factory near: Hardrock pur by three other friends.
After the sound check and just before the beginning of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group picture.
No trace of lamp fever.
Afterwards, the rock protagonists from eels and surroundings - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - loudly enthusiastically see about 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
The "Tiger Bonesaw" quartet with frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika is already able to convince the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from its own spring and the next CD.
In front of the stage, the band is danced at the appearance of a ambiguous and impressive interplay.
Although "tolerance" ropes are not to be overheard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leaves the stage to the Trio "Lord We Stand".
The fact that hardrock is not the same as hardrock shows guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with their alternative, sometimes classical rock in the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", a synthesizer is also used in "Here We stand" as a addition to the guitar rock.
Not only is the desired, just ballady "Take Me Home" arranged by the change of melodic passages to the guitarous rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
However, the quartet "The Ignition" from tonesque has played a special degree of knowledge since its founding in 2005.
Full agility the band presents her hardrock on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with their performances in front of a very large audience - youngest in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China - has documented special stage experience is obvious and unexplainable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann also sets his own accents at the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
Gitarrist Norbert Brinkmann has a rejoicing solo that he runs through the audience.
A certain volume belongs, of course, to such a hardrock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the Mixpult team at the Trinity Concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at press air hammer level, but is thus still clearly under the controls of the "wacken-Fesitval" pointing to "The Ignition" on their website.
Ear decibeling 120 decibels in nozzle drive volume as usual at the annual metal booth in the north of the Republic, however, the Ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After nearly four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocky Gangart have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous game and their own compositions.
"We stand here, have taken the bone saws and set a concert evening with the strength of a tiger," all three groups, of course in the transmitted sense, can say at the end.
And especially enjoy the great applause of visitors.

A sailing aircraft crashed on Sunday at a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
The pilot died in the calamity.
Near Mülheim/Essen Airport, a fatal accident occurred on Sunday.

Trump pulses Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the U.S. president of North Korea's powerholder Kim is quite well-sonned despite a nuclear crisis is not a secret.
But now Trump has made his colleague a genuine declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "gorgeous letters".
At the age of 72, the married U.S. president announced a new flame.
The tragedy: It's a remote relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made Kim Jong Un an unusual declaration of love to the North Korean power.
Before followers of the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-old splash of the ruler dynasty from Pjöngjang, although it proves to be fairly temperable disarmament in the rings around North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
"I was hard, he too, and it went between us," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim would have brought his heart to melt.
He wrote to me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection also had political fruits: Trump pointed to the stop announced by Kim of all nuclear and missile tests, even if critics see little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - does not seem to be any more memory, the U.S. president seemed well aware.
At any rate, he took the criticism of this when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they were in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
That's so unpresidial.
But he cares very little, Trump explained and then directed his wise finger to the crowd: "I have always told you that it is so easy to be presidial."
But then there wouldn't push 10,000 people into this furiously filled arena, but we only had 200 people out there.
Octoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Bestens visited, atmospheric and above spoiled by sun satt: Very varied and with a good shot October festival flair Baesweiler's city centre was exhausted on Sunday.

Refugees saved from libyschem prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees, using a mobile video, have pointed to their catastrophic detention conditions in Libya, thus enabling their rescue.
The group had turned the recording in her cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under life risk and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said a man in the video message.
We're suffering here, we're dying here.
The recording was sent to the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organisation for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flew to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video we couldn't have returned to Nigeria," said Efe Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old had been arrested in Libya when attempting to reach the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he put himself in danger of life according to his own statement.
One of his competitors was almost beaten to death by the guards, said Onyeka.
Generally, the detention conditions were catastrophic: "They all beat us with pipes and sticks."
They didn't give us anything to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees who are struck in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria had been sent back to their homes this year using the program, said the IOM speaker in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the now saved Nigerians is not exceptional in view of the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
But he hasn't heard of a help call by phone video so far.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as unworthy of human beings.
The North African state, which is dominated by too large parts of militia, is the main country for migrants on the way from Africa to Europe.

German was caught in its own car for days
A 75-year-old man had to endure several days and nights in his car in a forest area in central francs after he had stuck the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue forces accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and freed the missing since Tuesday evening, the police informed on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld, according to the data, was in good health condition despite the cold nights and the long time without supply.
He told me to look forward to his home now.

Laschet admonishes the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Minister-President Armin Laschet (CDU) in the discussion with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to its own information, has advised the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations of the two countries are currently "overshadowed", said Laschet on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns especially the waves of arrest, the freedom of the press and the religion.
In Erdogan, he has therefore made "that if relations are to be normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite".
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey, according to their own information.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of opinion would be respected.
Erdogan again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan was transferred to a short-term building of the Flight Preparation of the Federal Defense Ministry at Cologne Airport.
Originally, it should have been done on Castle Wahn, but the castle owners had rejected it from political conviction against Erdogan.
After the discussion, Erdogan continued to open the Ditib Moschee in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: "The Muslims who go into this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Missing trust in the USA: North Korea demands disarmament
While U.S. President Trump will not be tired of emphasizing the successes in the negotiations on denuclearization of North Korea, the East Asian regime represents the conditions more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri demands a presence of Washington.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed the US Government at the UN General Debate to block negotiations for a nuclear-wave-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest ceases, therefore, that the US builds on forced measures that are deadly for trust training," said Ri in New York.
In these circumstances, disarmament would be irrelevant to North Korea.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances there is no way that we are the first to escape ourselves," the North Korean chief diplomat launched.
That North Korea's penalties could "force knees" would be "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build trust, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test plant, Ri highlighted.
However, from the US side there had not been any "according reactions", criticized the Minister.
Due to North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council alone had decided three times last year against the internationally isolated country.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations in recent days to strictly respect the penalties.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June, Trump first met North Korea's powermen Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the President of the United States strives for a second summit with Kim.
In October Pompeo will return to Pjöngjang for discussions on the termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons programme.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the municipality
The fact that they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors to the house of the open door HoT didn't get anything: White blankets and flower decoration on the tables and a large buffet waited for the guests after the harvest thanks service.
The young people of the HoT had the buffet with delicacy from different countries in the new kitchen.
The establishment was financed by donations from the community for which the young people wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our cooling cabinets with foods and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then on the first day after the summer break, the evil surprise came: A power failure had set out the huge, two-part refrigerator, the food was corrupt and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again from the front: although we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, the children and young people wanted to do it alone," says Westbuer.
And so they all packed.
The result could be seen, the guests were enthusiastic.
"By better, it can't be chefs," an attendant was impressed, while Hokkaido cunei soup was served or the guests were allowed to use quake, liver cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have put on their legs," stressed Pfarrer Frank Beckmann, while magicians Stephan Lammen with card tricks and other pieces of art awesome.
Jürgen Sator leaves the national board NRW of the table
The head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has delivered his post in the country association from frustration about criticism from his own series.
Sartor had become known all over the country because the Essener Table had introduced a recording stop for foreigners.
He had already resigned in July as Vice Chief of the NRW-Tapels, said Sartor of the "World on Sunday".
I've fallen too many in my back.
The head of the NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, spoke against the dpa understanding of the decision of his long-term alternate.
The sharp criticism took Sartor.
"I can follow up his step - there people who didn't know exactly why the Essener Table does."
Sartor is still active for the Essener Table - "six days a week, there is nothing changing," says Weilerswist.
In the "World on Sunday" Sartor criticized criticism at colleagues from other tablets.
You cannot follow the approach "without us starving the people in the city".
It is the government's duty to ensure that people did not starve.
At a convention of the tablets in Berlin on Friday, the Essener did not attend.
"There is told me too much sweet shit," he said.
There are all these social fuzzis that have criticized me at that time.
SF Lorch plays 2:0 guide - Gmünder Tagespost
Football, districtsliga Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV hypocrites defeat in Kirchheim - bed rings makes Lauchheim clear.

Gladbach plays twice leadership - Schalke without Embolo with first victory
Borussia Mönchengladbach must continue to wait for an outward victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals play a lead twice.
Schalke comes for the first season win against Mainz (1:0).
(sda) Four times Schalke has maneuvered himself in the first five League games with early countertors.
Now the team of Domenico Tedesco reappeared that strength, with which it had been the first place behind the Bavaria during the last season.
Alessandro Schöpfe brought the Heimequipe in the eleventh minute after a strong pre-work of Jewgeni Konopljanka per head, as a result, the hosts preserved the mini-polster with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets newly from the top of the Bundesliga.
The team of Lucien Favre had acted against Bayer Leverkusen until the break a 0:2 reverse, but in the second half of the season came to the 4-2 victory.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65.) and Marco Reus (69.) like a doublette inside four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who was replaced by Favre in the 63st minute, provided with another doublet in the final phase (86./94).
The first victory was the VfB Stuttgart.
Against the yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, Werder Bremen had to fear in the meantime before the break.
Borna Sosa and the unremarkable Goalie Ron-Robert targeter featured a curiose throw-in owner that helped the guests to compensate in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a perfectly happy but also no misleading debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher with the Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave a lead twice, finally played 2:2 and since 2003 waited for an outward victory in the VW city.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible with his second Bundesligator.
Yann Summer was magnificent at the 20-metre plane of the Aargauer, as well as at the second hit after an hour.
Nevertheless, the tendencies at Gladbach are very heated.
In the storm of the foals, Alassane Pléa appears to be a goal getter.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record purchase from the OGC Nice came for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in the seventh compulsory game.
After seven rounds, Gladbach occupies the 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously untreated Werder Bremen against the VfB Stuttgart went into an uncomfortable position.
After 19 minutes, the team of Florian Kohlfeldt was surprised by a Stuttgarter Konter that the Ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis concluded with his first season hit, after 36 minutes, Milos Veljkovic continued to join his team: The 23-year-old Serbe collected after a Trikotzupfer against Daniel Didavi Yellow Rot.
Although Stuttgart's defender Borna Sosa and Goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought the Bremer back to play through a curiose hurry owner (68.), a quarter-hour before the end, Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgarters who were overnumbered back to the victory street.
Nuremberg decided the Duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereign for himself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens already brought the home team through foulpenalty.
Macedonian votes on new state names
In Macedonia today, some 1.8 million citizens vote on whether the name of their country is to be changed in northern Macedonia.
In the case of a yes, the almost three-decade conflict with the neighbours of Greece could be resolved.
Athens had existed on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked every approach to Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on the future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a member of Nato at a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrer in U-Haft.
Refugee attacked three women.
One Syrian brutally attacked three pensioners and injured them partly.
On Friday, the 41-year-old asylum wardrobe had eliminated at 22 a.m. in the escape street in Alsergrund.

As a result, the Syrian tried to strike and step the officials.
Little later it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older women (65, 67, 75) in the Währinger Street at a tram stop.
In addition, he had stepped the trio with his feet.
The pensioners were partly seriously injured.
They suffered haematoms, tremors, and brain shocks.

SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost just one year after the marriage came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave themselves the Jawort.
A registered partnership of life had not been confiscated for them, Kahrs had previously said the "Image" newspaper.
"When we marry, then right." He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesman of the SPD-Bundestagsfraction and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD flight.
In the Bundestagsdebate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs was excited on June 30, 2017 with anger talk.
So he had suggested Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) to have been "vertold".
"That was your shabowski-moment," he said in anticipation of the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, equal sex couples have been able to marry exactly like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their partnership of life since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the adoption law.
Garden day: 400 meters of hake cut
There was a lot of work before the members of the Citizens' Association Children's House and the Society for Lepra.
For approximately 400 meters of a gate around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfünndnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We do this to reduce the costs," said Walter Schröer, Chairman of the Civil Society.
And it's a lot of things gathered.
Due to the hot summer we're late this time, but fortunately it's just a form cut.
'Cause in spring, you've already shaved the hack.
The next breakfast at work has also been a long tradition.
"It's all supposed to stay with forces," said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner picks gold at the Canuslalom World Cup
The Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the Canuslalom World Championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old took a perfect course on Sunday on the Olympia track.
Two years ago, he had missed Olympic Bronnen by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, had enough rides here on the plant and it's all right today," said the Olympic Third of London 2012.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away from joy and ranked both arms conquerably into the height - well-knowed that it would at least be enough for one medal.
After all, he had first number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn't do his fable time of 89.69 seconds.
The second became the Czech Jiri Prskavec in front of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The police inspection Gauting mentioned the first attempt to break this autumn into a single family house.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days will be shorter - that's what wants to take advantage of inbreakers.
Thus, the police inspection Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break in this autumn.
It is due to the alarm system that it has remained on the one-familie house on the Königswieser Straße.
It went off when the offenders put hand on Friday just 20 a.m.
The inbrekers knew that the inhabitants weren't at home.
However, the alarm system apparently surprised them so much that they escaped without a prey.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Pleite bei Hertha: Retrieval of reality: Bavaria demanded against Ajax
The prediction is indispensable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bavaria "not to be liked".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first intermediate phase for the term of office of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance delle under the new Coach Nico Kovac is not supposed to increase to the larger natural depth for the Munichers.
"One week ago we had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we got a bit of the reality," Thomas Müller noted after the deserved 0:2 low position at Hertha BSC and demanded a response to the Champions-League-Doll with Ajax Amsterdam.
He who knows us knows that this is really annoying us and that's why we give gas to Tuesday.
For the first time for more than a year, no own gate shot out, like at the same time of the pre-season, two mandatory games in series without victory, lost the table leadership in the Football League first on Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1, with its running-intensive man-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle stitches across the outside, delivered two blue breaks within three days, as the most overpowered Bavaria can be knocked.
"Those who know the FC Bayers know that we won't let ourselves do this and we will do all we can to be successful again," Kovac stressed.
Otherwise, he went with his losers in his birth town, but surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the again lack of dealing with opportunities.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would nevertheless give rise to the first intermediate phase of his term of office - otherwise, the sound is likely to intensify.
So Kovac did not take exceptional measures before the second king's class performance of this season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second round game against Ajax, which had also forced the AEK Athens sovereign with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our gates again," announced Manuel New National Team Captain.
Like already after the lost pocalfinal against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich spoke clear text.
The defender of law appeared in the role as a maid.
"I don't think all this is pech, we have to work it again, because we don't make the variety of chances and make the mistakes behind," stressed the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous game, the Bavaria was already behind Dortmund with five counters, which has now taken the top again with a point of advance.
And horizon with an eye dwindling at least appreciated positively, that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavaria has now reached an end.
"Yes, that's good before," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schusslinie: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack from Erdogan on Grindel
With severe accusations, Turkish President Erdogan condemns an exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the interpretation of the permanent issue of Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish Prime Minister for the Opening of the Great Ditib Moschee in Cologne heavily criticized dealing with the former world champion in Germany, the DFB Chief defended the Association Line.
In the early Sunday morning, the Grindel, attacked by Özil personally in the Mainzer ZDF-"Sportstudio", announced consequences from the Causa.
"There we must draw very precise conclusions in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-Managements - that something is not repeated," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as further integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan did not stand for the values of football and DFB.
In sharp words, he had condemned a racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were able to take photographs with me in England," said Erdogan on Saturday in the city.
Honestly, as her president, I could not see that our two young men, who have risen up to the German national team, were excreted.
Grindel pointed to Gündogan's statement that, as opposed to Özil, he felt "goodly treated by the DFB after the World Cup apparel, which had been taken by photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to stand before players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm migrant - that's not going.
"I regret that he has such an impression," said Grindel.
We had to defend Mesut more, I've always said that.
A basis for a return of Özils to the national team, however, he does not see.
As a result, next to the born Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon, an additional integration officer will now be called.
"If there is one without a migration background that clearly works into society and soccer and says: "The topic is important, we have to take care of," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on site where integration needs to work," said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the WM-out and the Özil-Affaire, he wants to again compete for the office as DFB-President in the next year.
"I'm doing my job and trying to make her as good as it is," said Grindel.

Hamburg - Almost one year after the entry into force of the marriage for everyone, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-standing friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave themselves the Jawort.
A registered partnership of life had not been confiscated for them, Kahrs had previously said the "Image" newspaper.
If we get married, right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a spokesman of the SPD-Bundestagsfraction and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative SPD flight.
In the Bundestagsdebate on the opening of marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs was excited on June 30, 2017 with anger talk.
So he had suggested Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel (CDU) to have been "vertold".
"That was your shabowski-moment," he said in anticipation of the accidental announcement of the DDR border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, equal sex couples have been able to marry exactly like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to enter their partnership of life since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the adoption law.
Started referendum in Macedonia on new state names
In Macedonia, the highly expected referendum has started on a new name for this small Balkan state.
Approximately 1.8 million voters are supposed to decide whether their state is to be called northern Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the neighbor of Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens has blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and the Nato.
If the citizens vote with yes, they will also give the start of the Western integration of their country.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saves the Shoah from forgetting

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is designed to facilitate organ donations and to relieve members in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change that organs may continue to be taken with express consent, stresses Swisstransplant.
(dpa) Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This aims to facilitate organ donation and to relieve family members in stress situations.
People who want to make their organs available in death can be registered there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swiss transplant in case of need.
The new procedure does not change the fact that institutions can continue to be taken, as in Germany, only with express consent, stresses Swiss transplant.
It is assumed that 15 percent of Swiss donors have a donation card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases a card will be found at a decisive moment in possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the conversations, the family do not know the desire of the deceased.
"You must then deputyly decide in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany there are considerations to store information about possible organ donations on the healthcare card, as the spokesman of the Federal Center for Health Intelligence, Marita Völker-Albert says.
"A registry where people can enter their wishes - per or contra organ donation - does not exist," she says.
Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn has voted for a new regulation of the organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered organ donors unless he or his family contradicts.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old pupil is world champion in calculating
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is a world champion in the headquarters.
He continued in the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 competitors.
Martina Flamme-Jasper was informed of the Phano Science Museum, the site of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Gruß from Germany occupied the third place.
The recent World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student who was the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as Ralf Laue said.
The computer professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants responded to guests from the audience with calculator.
Wenzel Greet from Lastrup demonstrated how he held a ball with his head in the air when he ran.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Greeting had been there two years ago as a 14-year-old in Bielefeld.
With terms such as superhire, genius or miracle child, organizers can not start lauw.
"He can be trained," he said.
Many participants exercised several hours a day.
In India or Singapore, there are even stadium-oriented accounting competitions.
One of the disciplines is, for example, the square root pulling from six-digit numbers.
The candidates receive surprise tasks when computing versatility, for which they need to find a solution strategy quickly.
Here the Germans would also have good chances, said the main judge.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage of learning more intensive and effective methods in early childhood.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The Federal Government plans a clear extension of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.

Polar cold air brings new snow on the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle shake out her beds next week in the West for the first time: Polare Kaltluft reaches on Monday Vorarlberg, Nordtirol and Salzburg.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snowfall limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 metres - in narrow valleys it could cut down to 1,000 meters at strong intensity, said it.
From the Bregenzer Forest to the High Tauern, it is expected to be 20 to 40 inches of new snow over 2,000 meters.
On higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsee, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become winter.
Farmers may begin with the annual knick care on Monday
Sleeswig-Holstein's farmers may begin with the annual knick care on Monday.
The unique "green rolls" in Germany have been the landscape of the forest-arm state for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree and stroops are "walter set" and for many animals and plants the last withdrawal spaces.
Knicks connect spaces that are scattered as a corridor, which can still work on the exchange of organisms, as the managing director of the German Nature Protection Federation (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living teeth
The knicks were built on the basis of a command of the Danish king Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living fences" were not only field limitation and cattle fence, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and bars for their specialized houses.
From that time also comes his name "Knick": By "cnicking" the branches have been able to develop the dense, confused demarcations.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea stretches around 45 000 kilometres of the hooks and presents the picture of a wooden, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used as a spare habitat of some 7000 species.
In one kilometer of knick, up to 1800 different species could live and brew up to 30 bird pairs.
Its ecologically important function, however, can only be fulfilled by the knick if it is maintained accordingly in winter.
Otherwise, he kicks out into a light tree series, which, besides the variety of species, also reduces the effect of wind protection, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Knick Care may only be operated outside the breeding period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about SItuation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes the local situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami in the interview with the editorial network of Germany (RND):
Were you on site during the Tsunamis itself?
No, I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
Then when I learned about the tsunami, I immediately went back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because I had to drive more than 20 hours after a flight, since the airport was closed at Palu at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be flew in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all of which were completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is also destroyed, but we have set up provisionally something where we have also housed other people.
Where are the people living on Sulawesi now?
Many have been ran on surrounding hills, where they still endure for fear of another tsunami and earthquakes and where they have no access to water and food.
Some keep up in front of their houses, there are still trembling.
Because many food shops and also the tank stations are completely closed, people partially clutch food and petrol.
The public service has gone down completely, the national government helps out.
A prison was also destroyed, the prisoners were partly running freely around and the search for them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is communication and information on the island running?
At the moment, we have handy reception, but before we didn't work and we got information only over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors, and other people who do not know whether they live and where they are, because people were not at home during the earthquakes but, for example, on their way at work.
The Tsunami warning system has not worked properly.
Do you have information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not hit by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami hit the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Isn't an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific fire ring prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst thing.
We usually know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has hit many people.

The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic Sprint of PyeonVientianeg to grab the medal.
Seven tenth-seconds were missing on bronze at the end.
"I have consciously left time to process this," says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
A medal was the target, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.

Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in the turbot rate
The time is extremely short and the number of planned consultations is severely limited.
With a FBI investigation in the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US-Senate want to secure the thin majority for the judicial candidates of Brett Kavanaugh who are controversial about the need.
President Donald Trump has set the investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the suspected incidents over 30 years.
The recent turn in the drama around the call of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing by Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, in whose course the jurist wrestled against the oppositional democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the Archconservative Judge at the Supreme Court of the US.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demand a FBI investigation.
After tumult-like scenes, his party friends accepted.
President Trump, who mentioned the heavy reservations on Thursday as "decision", first contained further attacks against women and, on the contrary, spoke of "happy in unfortunateness".
In this way, last doubts could be eliminated, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the democrats sharply in a campaign because they refuse Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy".
Trump ords FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh to
The White House has also extremely limited the powers of the investigators.
One will investigate the known accusations of two women, not more, said a government representative to the "Wall Street Journal": "They don't go to a fishing trip".
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses are to be heard.
The mobile radar equipment installed in a "civil vehicle" of the city municipality of Ried for monitoring the tempo limit is stationed on the garden road, according to the municipality on Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed-installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: One felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season win.
However, the factor Time also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - In the meantime, Christian Heidel is known as a huge pessimist in football games.
That was not different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I saw every ball in it.
And there were many corners and many balls in our penitentiary," said the sports board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
After all, the king's blues have succeeded in bringing the short 1:0 against the Rhine hems over time and thus the first seasonal victory under roof and specialist.
It could actually have happened differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpfe 11 of the team of chief trainer Domenico Tedesco had given safety: "In sum the first half-time was good, both playful and from pressing.", apparently, with increasing play time, the head played an increasingly important role.
Actually don't shoot a headball spectacle
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," he said, "If the team was only half as nervous as I am on the bank, I can understand."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore continue to withdraw.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said Schöpfe, who had no inevitable share in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the manship."
But at the end only the victory counts.
The relief was noticeable throughout the Arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the beginning and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can be happy for a few hours.
I'm very happy for the team and fans.
We've played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to go on lots over 90 minutes
The probably greatest manco of the afternoon: King's blue missed it to worry for clearer conditions.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who twice met the Latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have been a victory," said Tedesco, "you already felt the fear a little."
That's why I'm glad we won.
He wasn't the only shalker.
Fischbachau: Smoking column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discussed integration: A discussion at eye height
The author, Professor Aladin El-Mafaalani, is in front of them.
He followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Housechild for the repeated time.
"I have made it my job to get interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treffs" - that association that cooperates with the "Cultural Policy" alliance in the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets very loose in the reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the topic understandable.
With a lot of skill, hand-resistant numbers and one or other joke, he brings the listeners to one of the most conflicting topics: migration and integration.
Why are conflicts increasing despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses the question of a metaphor to answer.
At one table the German society sits, on the cat table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to vote.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not essential whether to arrange politically on the right or on the left, but "I am for or against an open society?" he emphasizes.
At first, rather behave, then the discussion round begins increasingly.
And there is a need for talk.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or failed integration in pupils.
El-Mafaalani is present, not on stage, a symbol of the discussion: it is at eye height.
Sociology Professor does not insist on his opinion, emphasizes that he speaks of the average, not of individual fate.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because "first when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signing time, he has also been an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in the foyer, in case of prepared Kurdish specialities, more intensively discussed.

So Schalkes Naldo also manages "great sports" at the bank
For the third time not in the startelf: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-Trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had seated for the third time, not in the Schalker Startellf, but on the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great in many people if the nearly two-metre Brazilian had spoken the frustration of the soul.
But after the 1:0 win over the FSV Mainz 05, as usual in the middle and chef trainer Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, who all called simplicity-half-naldo, joined and said: "We have to thank, Trainer!"
"That was very emotional, that was great sport," later Tedesco said about the reaction of his Vice-Chapter, who, despite his reservoir existence, had no resentment.
Probably, Naldo, who was celebrated as the best shalker during the past season, knows that he did not get to his trainer's depository track, but has a break for good reasons.
A reason called "Steuersteuerung".
It wasn't easy to tell him that
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I tell you very honestly," said Tedesco of the moment when he said Naldo that he was not in the startlf.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the club," founded Tedesco the step.
Naldo played against Bavaria and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can now snip through.
And that we all keep in the boat," said Tedesco the rotation that has last caught Naldo.
And to whom the Brazilians responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also showing himself as an exemplary team player at the bank.
In August, the mood in Austria's industry continued its valley trip compared to the eurozone.
The shopping manager index (PMI) was located with 46.7 points on a 37-month depth.
However, throughout Europe, Austria has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute informed on Monday on his survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike Austria, the PMI of the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is therefore the 13th month in a row below the brand of 50 counters, which indicates growth.
Only Ireland's industry knocked this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
Final light were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer decreased, but slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level since March at 44.0 points.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has survived," said Markit-Ökonom Rob Dobson.
However, industry - in any case in the third quarter - remains the growth brake number one.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have no longer fallen as strong as since November 2011.
The companies therefore demolished posts for the seventh month in succession.
In China, industry production also decreased more than initially adopted in August.
The mood barometer decreased from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had first expected 47.8 points.
The shopping manager index bases its figures on representative surveys by 3,000 European industrial companies.
The developments in turnover, employment, warehouses and prices will be raised, among other things.
