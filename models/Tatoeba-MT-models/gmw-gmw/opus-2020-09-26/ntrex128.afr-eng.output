Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried they're going to look like stupid.
There is consternation among some meeting members on the proposal to change their title from AM'e to MWP'e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of all over the police spectrum are afraid that it could attract a ridicule.
One member of the Workers Party says his group is concerned because "twp and Pwp are rimming."
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means slastering.
A meeting member of the Plaid Cymru party says the group as a whole is "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptive" about the name change, but noticed that it is a short speech jump from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of foolish or foolish.
In this context the Welsh letter w is expressed like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to impose the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptions of what are called members of the Assembly will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves."
The Law on the Government of Wales 2017 gave the Welsh meeting the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support to call the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As regards the AM's title, the Commission Welsh Parliament chose Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM'e appears to be presenting alternatives, but the fight to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who has to present a legislative proposal on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on reforms will also include other changes to the meeting's work, including rules on the disqualification of AM'e and the design of the committee system.
AM'e will get the last word in the question about what they should be called when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country’s name
Choirs will vote on Sunday or change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was arranged in an effort to eliminate a decades of issue with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens already long insisted that the name of his neighbor in the north represents a claim in his area and has repeatedly shattered against his applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
The president of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the nation’s vote on the change of name, said that he would ignore the mood.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's get silent because churches in Harlem struggle.
"Historically, the old people I spoke to were there a bar and a church was on every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"None of the two are there today."
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
"People socialize today in other ways," he said.
"Crows are no longer neighborhoods' family rooms where people go regularly."
As regards churches, he is worried that the money will not keep out of stock sales as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they are back exactly where they started."
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who will not help the neighborhood’s remaining refugees.
"The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the day that these churches completely close will bring even closer, because most of the people who enter into these condominiums will probably not become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black congregation that worshipped nearby took over the building’s title.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Eerw. John Howard Johnson, who led a boicot of retailers in 125th street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to appoint or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson's members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carilion.
Early, David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the cariljon "the poor people's bells".
The expert who played the cariljon in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noticed that it was the first cariljon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger cariljon at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather says that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has been playing at St. Martin's for the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the leak eggs of the church, others by the Episcopal bishop.
The church council, the congregation's control body, consisting of leak eggs - wrote to the bishop in July with concern that the bishop "took to transfer the costs" to the church council, although the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the bishop.
Some congregation members complain about a lack of transparency from the diocese side.
Hai injures 13-year-old on lobster in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old son on Saturday and injured when he dived for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, says officers.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for a half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy for help gilling and then sailing with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel said he thought it was only the excitement of a first lobster, but then he realized that he called, 'I was bited!
I'm bited!"
His whole key leg was torn open," Hammel saw when he came out to the son.
"I called that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' added Hammel.
The boy was flying to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as criticism.
It is not known which species of sharks is responsible for the attack.
Larry Giles said at a media information session that a shark was observed in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of his upper body.
Officials closed the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plan extension to UK beauty market
Sainsbury's say Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams are fighting with department shop-type beauty courses that were mandated by specialist assistants.
As part of a large expansion in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and households drop back, the larger beauty courses in 11 shops will be tested across the country and if it is a success next year to more shops.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets are looking for ways to fill shelfs once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury’s say that it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will for the first time include trade names such as Revlon, Essy, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also find more place with trademark specific areas similar to those seen in shops like Boots.
The supermarket also launches its Boutique make-up series again so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly - something on which more younger buyers are insisting.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury shops, the first last week opened in Croydon in South London and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local comfort stores means that supermarkets must do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive officer of Sainsbury's, said that the shops are going to look more like department shops when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products against Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's placed Argos sales points in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitat sales points since it bought both these chains back two years, which, according to their grocery sales, strengthened and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint company with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how the profits from the pharmaceuticals should be divided within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacy for £125m to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says that Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We transformed the appearance and feeling of our beauty courses to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be at hand to provide advice.
Our series of trade names are designed to meet every need and the appealing environment and comfortable locations mean that we are now a terrific beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'woeding' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from £11 million agreement
Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones walked away 'woeding' after TV provider Holly Willoughby withdrawed her to a £11 million agreement with his lifestyle trademark existence to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby didn't have time for their home clothes and attendance trade name, Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name.
The This Morning Provider, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den-ster Peter Jones angry by withdrawing from their profitable lifestyle trade mark-being - to focus on her own huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones was "wrathful" when TV's golden girl was Tuesday at a tense meeting in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, announced that her new opportunities - worth up to £1.5 million - meant that she couldn't spend enough time on their home clothes and attendance trade name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name and would have doubled, according to the dedicated Willoughby’s estimated £11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she left Truly, Jones climbed on a rayer and exchanged Britain for one of his holiday homes.
A source says: "Truly was Holly's greatest priority far away.
It would be her long - term future that would carry her over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw her was totally stupid for all those involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to the release.
There's a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters that stands right to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning provider, one of Britain’s stars that causes most money to flow, can chase the company millions out of the bag because of the huge investment in products stretching from kissings and cherries to clergy and home clothing, and the possibility that its release can encounter even more delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin has been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby set up Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples have vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent share in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become a trademarkambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as a provider of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business matters."
Hard words 'and then we become in love'
He mocked about criticism that he was going to get from the news media because he made a comment that some would regard as "unpresidential" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his comma-"new reader voice."
"I didn't give up."
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a big step towards the nuclear defence of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament burned.
North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June Leader Convention in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North did not see a "comparative reaction" of the U.S. on North Korea's early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues with sanctions aimed at persistent pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic impact in his convention talk.
"We advance excellently with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to start a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship."
He says that his efforts to improve relationships with Kim have resulted in positive results — it terminated rocket tests, helped liberate hostages, and causes the rest of American soldiers to be brought back home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to come into 'this crowded arena, we would have had nearly 200 people just standing there," Trump said while he pointed to the crowd right before him.
Tile waves and earthquake in Indonesia ruin island, death hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were said that they were not required.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population were displaced, no national disaster was announced, a prerequisite for catalizing international aid.
"In many cases they were very clear that they did not ask for international help, which makes it a little difficult," said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children are compiling a team to travel to Palu, it is not sure that foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials evaluate the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the assistance efforts.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia continues to endure, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the anger of nature.
While tsunamis shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami alert in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though a warning of power.
Traveling between Indonesia’s many islands is at its best challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on the way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made the improvement of Indonesia’s fermented infrastructure a central point of his electoral campaign and issued challenging money on roads and railways.
However, Mr. Yoko’s administration is harassed by financial deficits as he faces rechoosing next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressures of slumping sectarian tension in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim superiority accepted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands of people were displaced like Christian and Muslim gangs with brassmen, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons on the street.
Watch: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a premierliga loss against Chelsea with a purpose in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri gave to Sturridge when he was about 30 yards out of the Chelsea goal and his team 1-0 behind.
He typed the ball to the left before he headed far to the target stake.
The attempt sailed high over the frame as it floated to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball tucked over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
"It was just to try to come in that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create for myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw edge coming and once typed and didn't think too much about it and just kicked it."
Chelsea was at half a time 1-0 before after the Belgian star Eden Hazard had recorded a purpose in the 25th minute.
The Blues' target head played in that playroom with a back-up to Mateo Kovacic again before he told near the middle field and nailed into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward-head he then led for Hazard into the frame.
Hazard crossed the defense and ended with a left foot-head past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest target net.
Liverpool runs Wednesday at 3 p.m. the fight against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea comes Thursday to stand 3 p.m. in London in the UEFA Europa League before Videoton.
Death Valley rises to 832 after Indonesian Tsunami
The death count in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped under the garbage of buildings that caused the earthquake, which hit Friday at a size of 7.5, and caused burners of up to 20 feet, said the agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho to a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its over 380,000 people, was sown with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest husband, 32, under suspicion of murder after woman's death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything to come forward.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is at an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was in the area of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspiciously, to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam film material, to contact us as they may have information that could be essential for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was an inhabitant of Birkenhead, and that she was found within a property.
This afternoon friends who believe they know came up the woman at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Examinations are continued as the police said they are in the process of informing the victim’s neighbors.
A taxi manager who lives in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Inhabitants are now told that it will take hours before they are left again.
It was heard that a police officer told one man that the whole area is now treated as crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene in tears.
She repeatedly said 'it's so ugly.'
At 2:00 a.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another car just outside.
A number of officials were left inside the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to turn @MerPolCC on DM, 101 or to link Crimestopers anonymously to 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as reference.
Parliament's Statute of Cromwell becomes the latest commemorative meeting with ‘rewrite history’ dispute
His exile will be poetic justice for its Taliban -like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious art objects carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "sotness" and "a attempt to rewrit history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate on the removal of statutes that the shape of Oliver Cromwell outside the palace of Westminster would become a target.
The sculpture of the English civil wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the acts of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s manjiphic representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as defender of parliament against external pressure, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is a completely accurate representation, the subject of continuing historical debate is.
What is firm is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has given shape to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually identifiable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as Protector is also worthy of celebration and anniversary."
Killer Pig Several Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his "Yuan", was found with a crushed artery with blood covered dead near a hockey at the market in Liupanshui in the Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a carfare farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining of Qinghai province, China.
According to reports, Wednesday he traveled with his cousin of the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pighok open.
He said there was a large male pig in the cake with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation, according to the report, confirmed that the 550-pond pig ate the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were blooded and crushed," said the cousin, called on his side, "Wu," quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera film material showed how Yuan entered the market Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed its pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A brand manager told the Evening New that the pig was locked to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
Yuan’s family and the market authorities are said to negotiate remuneration for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs that attack people have previously reported.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650 pounds-vark had pierced a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife had scared the beast.
After a farmer of Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer of Manitoba told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as "sneller".
"They're just playful.
They're pricks, very curious... they're not trying to hurt you.
You just need to show them the right amount of respect," he said.
Res of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwest U.S.A.
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring flood rain across northern Mexico and southwest U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had eastern winds from 85 p.m., a category of 1 oracle, from 5 p.m. onwards, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough across the Pacific begins to take shape and move east to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to drive heavy tropical humidity northwest-west the southwest of the US.
Rosa will bring rain from up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical humidity in response to the approaching trough over the coming days will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid floods, waste flow, and may cause land collapse in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the southwest, especially over the largest parts of Arizona.
Fast floods may be with rapidly deteriorating conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to risk on foot the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep - pounded rivers to touch and thunderstorms to bring fierce local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall counts of more than half a inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth riding benches.
It will be the region’s first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rainstorms will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rain becomes more widespread on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread Tuesday to the Four Angle and last until Wednesday.
October can see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as cooling the Arctic, but the tropics remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, tall summer heats will try to rise and expand again.
It is expected that large parts of the central and eastern US will begin hot October, with widespread 80s from the Southern Layer Plain to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term climate prediction indicates a higher chance of above average temperatures for the eastern US for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people look at Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the stirring testimony of the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault claimed to have occurred in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political dead point continued, with broadcasters who regularly interrupted programs for Friday's on-the-slipping: an agreement achieved by Arizona-senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to carry out a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate-Justiz Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was drunken and tried to pull her clothes out from a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
It is likely that over 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Digits were not immediately available for other networks that showed them, including PBS, C-SPAN, and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look at offices.
To put it in perspective, it's an audience as big as one for a decisive football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was all the networks ahead with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, said Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was caught on Friday morning on CNN and CBS- where protesters shouted upon him when he tried to take a lift to a judicial committee.
He stood a few minutes with beaten eyes while CNN was figurative of his bad words.
"I stand right here before you," said one woman.
"Do you think he tells the land the truth?
It was said to him, "You have power while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and closed before the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks covered all later living hours when the judicial committee would vote for Kavanaugh's appointment to the full Senate for a voice.
But Flake said that he would only do this with the mind that the FBI would look at the accusations against the candidate for the next week, as the Democrat minority requested.
Flake was partially convinced by conversations with his friend, Democrat-senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Cous and several senators thereafter, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the voices to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump introduced an FBI examination of the charges against Kavanaugh.
British EM May accuses critics of ‘political game’ on Brexit
First Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political play" with Britain's future and the undermining of national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain's First Minister Theresa May arrives on September 29, 2018 for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview along with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former minister of foreign affairs Boris Johnson continued with his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that a suggestion that Britain and the EU should invoke each other's tarifes was "completely ridiculous."
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrests suspicious Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspicion in the fatal death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and arrested on a charge of second grade murder, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials issued a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the squad.
The police found the glass on the scene and said that they had found Simpson’s DNA on it, reports CBS affiliated WAFB.
After interrogating Simpson, the police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His deposit was fixed at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The court office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wounded at the head at the neck.
The department praises the Louisiana State Police's fleeing task force, the state police's crime laboratory, Southern University Police, and territorial citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU-atletic Director Joe Alleva thanks the area law application for his "yver and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-six predictor grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average past season was 5.6 points and 2.6 returnes per game.
On Friday morning, LSU-basketball coach Will Wade said the team in "slashed" and "in shock" about Wayde's death.
"This is what you're worried about," said Wayde.
Volcano spits as in Mexico City
As from the Popocatepeti volcano, the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital reached.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater and registered 183 releases from gas and ashes in 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple drownings and shakings.
Images on social media showed how thin low gas car windscreens in neighborhoods of Mexico City cover such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have marked an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since an earthquake with a range of 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police conflicts with Catalan Separatists before Memorial of Independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona Saturday after pro-dependency protesters crashed with polluting, and thousands joined counter demonstrations to remember the first commemoration of Catalonia’s polarizing voice for defense.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were held back by illusion pollutants robbed them with eggs and threw powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually weaved from tourists.
Later in the day, a steering also broke out, and the police had to use their clutches to control the fighting.
In several hours, pro-independence groups sang on one tone "No forget, no forgiveness" in confrontation with the unionists' screaming of "Lank Life Spain".
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries suffered in the processions reported the local press.
The tension continues to be high in the independent region a year after the referendum of October 1 by Madrid was considered illegal but celebrated by separatis catalans.
Choirs voted overwhelmingly to become independent, but the participation was low, with those against deportation who had largely boikotted the voice.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent violent conflicts from continuing the voting at the Voice Halls throughout the region.
Pro-independency groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful for the prospect that Catalonia will gain independence.
"Last year we spent one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote but now stuck us," he said.
Despite a vital but nail crab victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-dependency parties struggled this year to maintain momentum, with many of their most famous leaders either in self - imposed exile or in prearre for their role in the organizer of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took the demonstration on his phone in support of the police, says the conflict was encouraged by politicians on both sides.
"It becomes more and more stressed," he said.
Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-accession since late last year, announced that he was going to be in European parliamentary elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disregard the decline in democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car fasting at home

The inside unfolded Thursday at about 19: 30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said that damage to the gates and the building itself was done.
A crossbow may also have been shot at a time after the car.
Menga goal gives Livingston 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga’s first goal for Livingston assures victory
Promoted Livigston amazed Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 competitions as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s goal proved the difference when Gary Holt’s team moved with Hibernian to the second.
Gerrard's team remained this season in the Prime and came to stand before the predecessors Heart, which are their eight points ahead.
Rangers are first host to Rapid Vienna in the European Liga on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston expands their unoverwhelmed lopies in the division to six competitions, with chief trainer Holt who still did not taste a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances of butt visitors
Holt's team must have walked ahead long before they had recorded a purpose, with their driftness that Rangers had brought all kinds of problems on the neck.
SR broke through, but wore before the target hook, then AL could only play wide after approaching and CH’s headhold across the target hook.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play before them, knowing that they could get the visitors with death game moments.
And thus came the decisive purpose.
Rangers left a freeshot and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson who together gave Menga the chance to kick and sign a goal from the middle of the frame.
By that time, Rangers had dominated possession but could not penetrate home defense, and target guard Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a blow of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by the feet of Rangers' target guard Allan McGregor, and Lithgow ticked wide to escape another open game from Livingston.
Crosses repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly stopped, while two penalties — after Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball — were rejected.
‘Fenomenal’ of Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and results for Livingston.
Until the last man was excellent; they continue to exceed expectations on this upward track.
Their game style and manship have been almost unchanged since their return to first grade, but much honor comes to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hackett was gigantic with his manjiphic defense arrangement, while Menga for Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes all the time.
Rangers, however, lacked inspiration.
As well as at times under Gerrard, they could not observe those standards.
The final ball was missing and only once they could penetrate through the home team, which was somewhat of a rice call for Rangers, which they found in middle division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were Saturday (September 29) smiles and blue air when leaders from Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO federations.
They had an outbreak of issues that include human rights, freedom of the press, and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan was then Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city houses the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police quoted certainty reasons to prevent the 25 000-strong crowd from meeting before the mosque, but many supporters arrived to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of their Kurdish – also thickened their voices and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The opposing demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted as hero by some German Turks and is cried out by others as autocratic.
Deptford road accident: Bicycle driver dies in motor collision
A bicycle driver died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics were present, but the man died on the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-tread in Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday's accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials work to identify the man and to notify his neighbors.
Road shuttings and bus routes were in place, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards in retreat injured
Six guards were injured in an incitement at a high security men's prison, said the prisoner office.
Oproer broke out about 09: 30 BST Sunday and is still on the move at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist "Tornado guards" were called to handle the incidence, including eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for small facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been evolved to pay attention to an ongoing inside at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and can stay behind bars longer."
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that after he was attacked by a prisoner, the head of the prison was hospitalized.
And in October last year, turbulent officials were called to pay attention to serious disorder during which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Orkaan Rosa Dreig Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kitsvloede (Droogtegebiete Trek Dalk Advantage)
It's unusual that a tropical low pressure hit Arizona but that's exactly what might happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa's remaining energy moves across the southwest desert and brings immediate flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued fast - flood guards for Monday and Tuesday for Western Arizona to south and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
It's expected that on Tuesday Rosa will take a direct route over Phoenix, and by Monday late will approach with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a twitter that only " ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status since 1950 within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The National Orcan Centre’s models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Come, will probably get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated total of possibly up to 4 inches.
Rosa’s rain is likely to be a blessing for those outside the immediate flood risk, since the region is plagued by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, since the southwest currently experiences drought.
According to the U.S. Drying Monitor, only over the 40 percent of Arizona experience at least extreme drought, the second highest category, ” reported weather.com.
First, Orkaan Rosa’s road leads to approaching land throughout the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still against hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north by 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, so her strength is diminishing.
So it is expected that she will reach the country in the afternoon or evening at tropical storm strengths in Mexico.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"Reinvaltotals from 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," reported Weather.com.
Rosa will then move as a tropical storm north over Mexico before it reaches the Arizona border in the early morning as a tropical depression and will then move through Arizona and southern Utah at late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger expected from Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the United States Southwest," said the National Orcan Centre.
It is expected that this rain can cause life - threatening rapid floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempts to kill
Three teenage boys a 20-year-old man was arrested under suspicion of attempt to kill after a 16-year-old was found with sting wounds in Somerset.
The injured teen boy was found at about 04:00 p.m. on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, said Avon and Somerset Police.
Officials appealed to anyone who might have any cell phone image material of what happened to come out.
Trump says Kavanaugh that 'has suffered under the commonness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
"A Voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to reject the merciless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a convention in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh suffered under the commonness, the anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh witnessed Thursday before the Congress and fervently and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually attacked her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also witnessed her claim during the trial.
The president said Saturday the Americans saw that day "the brilliant and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most effective legal spirits of our time, a jury with a pure record of public service," he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president referred indirectly to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the middle-term elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I'm not standing, but actually I stand," he said.
That's why I fight for these candidates everywhere."
Trump argued that the democrats were on a mission to "resist and impede."
The first important procedural voice on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected not to take place later than Friday, said a senior GOP leadership assistant to CNN.
Hundreds of death because of Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with still rising figures
At least 384 people were dead and many were washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a great earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people assembled on Friday in the city of Palu on the beach for a festival on the beach when burners broke up to six feet [18 m] high at sunset on the beach, spoiled many after their death, and destroyed all that was in the road.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-range earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat developed yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not run immediately and they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency BNPB during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, stumps, houses, it hit all on the ground," said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before it hit the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photos released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops that have been destroyed, bridges that have been distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks still shook the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s agency for the evaluation and application of technology (BPT) stated in a declaration that the energy released by Friday’s giant fever was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sat at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "prestigious," saying thousands of houses, hospitals, shop centers, and hotels collapsed.
Bodys of some victims were found where they were trapped under the ruins of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the accidents and damage could be larger along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, a area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake squad.
Communication "is completely impeded with no information" from Donggala, said Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a declaration, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticized Saturday because they did not say that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said that the waves had come at times the warning was issued.
In amateur image material shared on social media, a man can be heard on the top floor of a building desperate warnings about the coming tsunami screams to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water strikes the beach and swept buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately declare the image material genuinely.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power breaks that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending trucks with the help of Jakarta and other cities, said authorities, but evacuated still need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport was reopened only for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo would visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia-tsunami mortality increases over 800.
It is very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu City where workers were hiding in dexeile shelters built in their office’s courtyard, they passed by scenes of destruction, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me that they had seen many houses that were destroyed," he said.
It is very bad.
Even as assistance groups begin with the terrible task of launching the disaster relief task, some people have complained that foreign assistance workers are prevented from traveling to Palu with much experience.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies, and personnel from overseas may not come into operation until the area of the disaster has been declared to be a national disaster area.
That has not yet happened.
"It is still a disaster on a provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman of the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, "Good, it's a national disaster," we can open it for international assistance, but it hasn't yet a status."
At the beginning of the second night on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and relatives of those still missing hope that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
Saturday a little boy was taken out of a sewage pipe.
Sunday rescue workers saved a woman had been trapped under ruin for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, coordinator of the Indonesian national parachute weaving team, trained two of the missing parachute swevers for the Asian Games that once ended this month in Indonesia.
Among those who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a senior in the parachute wing field I had my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel on social media circulated under the parachute wing society, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
His messages, however, were answered only with one gray regulation, instead of two blue rectifications.
"I think it means the messages haven't been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 on refill of OTM by Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole Friday morning $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an OTM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news statement from the Newport Police Station.
The car’s driver was erasing an OTM in an entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, rechercheur Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man came "from behind the Brink's worker running" and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the inn.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West will change his name – to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "The being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been the nickname Ye and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to announce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for "emotional reasons", said the program's manufacturer.
In addition to the fact that it is an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'yes'," said West earlier this year when he discussed his album title with radio provider Big Boy.
"So I am you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to only Ye – just reflecting our good, our bad, our confusion, all.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
He is one of a number of famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs has been known, among other things, as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West-worker, JAY-Z, had finished with or without a pairing sign and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO promises not to use military against civilians
Mexican newly chosen President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised in the beginning of the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody retribution against students to never use military power against civilians.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador promised to "never use the military to control the Mexican people."
Soldiers shot a peaceful demonstration in the plaza on October 2, 1968, where up to 300 people died in a time when left-handed student movements took place throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by granting monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training are attracting youth to gangs.
U.S. has to double AI funding
With China that becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. has to double the amount spent on research in this field, investor and KI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked with Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even shortly the US has made a total formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China announced their plan last year: they aimed to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Double the AI research budget will be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," said Lee.
The double of funding can double the chances that the next large AI performance will be achieved in the U.S., said Lee this week in an interview to CNBC.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that knocked the highest approved U.S. Othello player and later was a management officer at Microsoft Research and President of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous technology competitions of the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robotics challenge and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. must often work hard to win government seats, said Lee.
"It's not China that takes away the academic leaders; it's the corporations," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have in recent years appointed influential persons from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to assist the US AI efforts.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD's in AI," he said.
China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organisations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, said Lee.
Earlier this year, the United States Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial intelligence aimed at involving partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of a cherry committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, U.S. legislation that aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence last months came under fire.
Macedonians vote in election or change the country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", action that would solve a decade-old disgust with Greece that blocked its membership bots for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbouring country's name represents a demand in the area and refused their authorisation to NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents reasoned that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he wouldn't vote in the referendum and a boicot campaign sowed doubts about whether the attendance will meet the minimum 50 percent that is needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum voting letter read: "Is you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
Supporters of the change of name, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argued that it is a price that can be paid to pursue authorisation for Macedonia, one of the countries that came into existence from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, for this means safer lives for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said that they would accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The change of name will require a second-render in Parliament.
The State’s Election Commission said there was no reports of inhibitions by 1 p.m.
But the attendance was only 16 percent then, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of the registered electors voted.
"I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a chooser in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko bring their voices to the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country's name that will open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Before Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small hook and approached chairs before tents set up by those who go to the referendum boicot.
"We're in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door," said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration."
First Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring very necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the large majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," said Zaev after he brought out his voice.
He said a "yes" result will be "firmification of our future."
A survey published last Monday by Macedonia’s Institute of Policy Research noted that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, performed by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of them, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, attendance must be 50 percent plus one voice.
A relapse in the referendum will be the first serious relapse for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero Navigates Through Whole Brighton Defense For Purpose
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling removed the Brighton defense in Manchester City’s 2-0 wins on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy at his goal in the 65th minute.
At the beginning of the series, the Argentine target head received an offer at the middle field.
He struck between three Brighton defenders before he struck the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed by one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton target hook.
He then pushed a face to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English predictor used his first contact in the cake to send the ball back to Aguero, which used his right foot to knock the Brighton target guard Mathew Ryan with a bark to the right of the net.
"Aguero struggles with problems with his feet," said City manager Pep Guardiola to journalists.
"We talked about he was playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We are happy that he has recorded a purpose at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premierliga struggle.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
At that game, Aguero received the ball deep into the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had some contacts before he led Sterling to the farthest target corner.
The Sky Blues ’ predictor kicked the ball in the net just before he was over the backline.
City takel Hoffenheim in Campioeneliga Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. by Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoilers against Rockies
With the Nationals who are from the playback, there is little reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still plays for the Rockies, which has a single match advantage above the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least achieved a promotor choice with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday evening, but still want to fasten their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, at least we can play the competition knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any point of I will face this year.
Why will I not want to participate in it?"
The Nationals still have to announce their starting player for Sunday, but is reportedly favorable to throw Scherzer into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th, had a throw-training session on Thursday and will play on his normal rest- Sunday.
The Washington right hand is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 outlets in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump holds conventions in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice of Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican attendance at the middle - time elections.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lifetimes.
It's one of the big, big – I don't stand, but I actually stand and that's why I fight all over for these candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening now.
And now they are determined to take back the power, using any possible way, to see the commonness, the genius.
They don't care who hurts them, about whom they shall walk to get power and control, that is what they want, power and strength, we shall not give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder."
"And one sees it over the past four days," he said, and called the democrats "wrath and common and gentle and false."
He referred to the name to Senate’s judicial committee’s high - ranking Dianne Feinstein, who had been harshly bore out of the audience.
"Remember her answer?
Did you leak this document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, I wait one – it was really weak body language – the weakest body language I have ever seen."
Workers party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who say what they think
When Momentum's activists voted in my local party to put me under censure, it wasn't quite a surprise.
After all, I am the last person in a string of Workers Party LPs to whom we were told to be not welcome – all because we have said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received similar treatments because she rose in a fearless way against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticized me because I differed from Jeremy Corbyn.
Ironically enough about the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, similar issues that Jeremy differed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Workers Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of my eight years as the local Workers Party LP, that was exactly what Friday evening's AR meetings were.
Sadly, today it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "friendlyer, more beneficial" politics has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It has become increasingly evident that different views are not tolerated within the Workers Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether they are acceptable to the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views, began expecting me to make an U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether about national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a tradle of crooking on social media that asks that I not be reselected, disapproved of politics from the core, and to tell me that I should not be in the Workers party.
And that is not just my experience.
Actually, I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments directed to me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a flood of sexistic or racist insults every day, but never shaken away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insulting normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Workers Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of suspicion" or change of selection rules the party becomes tighter.
I have had a lot of advice over the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not to be so pronounced and that I will be "ouke."
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since I joined the Workers Party 32 years ago, encouraged by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally left my state higher school, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it the most – whether as a local council member or government minister.
I never hid my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policy positions and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who advocated the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country that sends on a Brexit that will damage all households, businesses, and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader the Workers party.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my choosers, whether they are members of the Workers Party or not: I am proud of serving you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-choosed or political advantage will prevent me from doing what I believe is in you all's best interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have pulled the final outcome somewhat wrong, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to victory in this wonderful-beautiful Tennant's Premiership contest of the day.
They are now top of the pupil, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, who wore the home team and trainer Peter Murchie have all right to be content.
"We have been tested so far in our competitions and we are still unconquered, so I must be happy," he said.
Robin Christe of Melrose said, "Honor Ayr, they took their chances better than we have."
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, meant by Frazier Climo, made Ayr before, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the competition by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot recorded an unintentional three.
Climo enlarged Ayr's advantage with a penalty head just before he, just before resting, had meant a solo three to make it rest time 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose began the second half well, and Patrick Anderson’s three, meant by Baggot, reduced the backdrop to five points.
There was a long retention for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott, which was carried on a portable, and from the beginning Ayr increased the advance with a Stafford McDowall-drie, meant by Climo.
Ayr's perceptive captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintentional three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of very busy game.
The home team made a return and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he had killed for Climo without the ball, and from the penalty stand, MacPherson put the ball down behind the coming Ayr-loss meal.
Climo meant it, he also did nest almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong’s target head and flanked Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game-ster seems he's going to approach new career in restaurant industry
Still Game-ster seems to move to the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was assigned as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays in with old comedy coach Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next ninth season would be the last of the program, and Krun seems to make up for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source suggested at the Scottish Sun that Krun would be involved in Glasgow's "florging restaurant industry".
'The sea is our's: land-circulated Bolivia hope court will reopen away to the Pacific Ocean
Matrose patrolls a mast-covered fleetquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea-blue flag.
Marine bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon were pasted with the slogan: "The sea is rightly ours.
It's a duty to get it back."
Throughout the country - surrounding Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that they lost on Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – nest the need to navigate the Pacific.
That hope is probably the highest that it was in decades, while Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the international court on October 1, after five years of discussions.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and obviously expects the outcome with a positive attitude." said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the IGH pronunciation on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Tribunal in The Hague will find in favour of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president – who faces a controversial struggle for re-election next year — also has many that depend on Monday’s ruling.
"We're near returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that few would change if it was.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to assign to Chilean territory and has stressed that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH's ruling comes only six months after the last interview shows that the case was "not complicated," says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than help Bolivia’s case, it may have slowed down over the past four years.
"The question of access to the sea has been purchased by the current Bolivian administration," said Zárate.
Morales ’ aggressive rhetoric tempered any remaining Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk again at a time, but it would be a great difficult time to convene.
The two countries last exchanged ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relationships with Chile" and a chance to end "to 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime question as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The pronunciation is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless they can trust U.S.
North Korea’s Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they couldn't trust Washington.
On Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to observe the promises made during a consultation in Singapore between the competing countries' leaders.
His comments follow to U.S. state secretary Mike Pompeo is evidently on the edge to restart nuclear diplomacy, which reached a dead point, over three months after the Singapore with North Korea's Kim Young Un.
Ri says it's a "dream image" that continued sanctions and U.S. caption to an explanation that ended the Korean War will also bring the North on its knees.
Washington is careful to agree to the declaration without taking significant steps to disarmament at first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second consult.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about doing a distance from an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump board.
Paris’s fashion shows reveal the latest series of major head covers on the way to the shops near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely turn off the sun, you do not have to search further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of lawween overwhelming head covers at their SS19 collection on the loop board that enchanted the style at Paris Modeweek.
Outstandingly unpractical hats crossed this summer Instagram, and these designers paraded their stunning creations on the loopplank.
The extinguisher by Valentino was an overwhelming beige hat with a feathery wide edge that swallowed the models' heads.
Other overwhelming attendances included wheat lemons decorated with jewellery, a magician hat, and even a pineapple — but it is not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bishop masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had closed lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute coutures.
One creation looked like skuba equipment, including a snorkel and dive glass, while another looked like a melted ice ice horn.
And if you continue the great fashion, it is your happy day.
Style viewers predict that the huge hats may be on the way to the shops near you.
The overgreat hats follow shortly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two foot wide edge seen on all's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely unpractical hat that was spread over socially, sent another great creation over the loopboard – a straw-strand bag that was nearly as large as the swim trousered model that wore it.
The burned orange raffiasack, finished with raffiafraiings and finished a white leather handle on the top, stood out at Jacques' La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Modeweek.
Known silencer Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large hats and beach bags appear in stores for next summer – since the designer made such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for overwhelming attendants.'
John Edward: Language skills vital to world citizens
Scotland's independent schools have a rhythm of academic excellence, and it continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, only strengthened by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community companies.
With more than 30,000 schools throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), pursue to provide the best level of service to their schools and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their schools for further and higher education, their chosen career, and their position as world citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement a new school curriculum, we see that world languages continue as a popular and desirable choice of professionals in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people of other countries.
From this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are top of the league tables with the highest successes in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have gained a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 members' schools, showed that 72 percent students had a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same prestige as the STEM boxes (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools' curricula and elsewhere.
In 2014, a survey by the UK Commission for Practice and Skills found that some of the reasons that employes provide why they are struggling to fill posts are attributed to a shortage of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more probable job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real benefit in the future with such a lifelong skill.
To communicate directly with people from other countries, a multilingual person will automatically place above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important now to invest in today’s children’s language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will teach which are considered essential to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Small independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be discovered at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still extremely important for the country's future, so it must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages must really be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity, and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
I'll be good by faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make Sunday debut for San Diego Lakers
The guard is almost over for adherents to see LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers trainer Luke Walton announced that James would play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego in Sunday’s pre-season opening game.
However, exactly how many minutes he is going to play still needs to be determined.
"It would be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell twittered that James would probably play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers's six matches in the pre-season program.
"I don't need to be ready at this stage in my career pre-season games," he said.
Trump's West Virginia convention time, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts this evening a wave of elections in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump’s first of five scheduled joints in the following week, including stop in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote currently held for his choice of filling the offices in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the coming election because the Republicans are at risk of losing control over the Congress when voted in November.
How late is Trump's gathering in Western Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
Trump's joining in Wheeling, West Virginia, was scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can see Trump's gathering in West Virginia through living flow.
Trump will probably pay attention to this week's hearings for the appointed Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense on accusations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held for a week while the FBI investigated.
However, the main view of this excess is to help the Republicans before difficult elections in November.
So President Trump's campaign said that these five conveniences were aimed at visiting "freelancers and supporters while Republicans tried to protect and enlarge the majority they had in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Management over the Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season," said a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to be called, to Reuters.
Tonight's join, arranged for the Wesbanco-arena in Wheeling, supporters can move from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday the second time the last month will be that Trump West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with over 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help the Western Virgin Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, which is behind according to the voice patterns.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a buzz at the Voice Box," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Traveler Cup 2018: The U.S. team shows that they have courage for the struggle to keep the hope alive when entering in Sunday’s single game
After three one - sided sessions, the four - game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Rider Cup needed.
The swinging slinger of momentum is an entirely invented sports concept but one in which players wholeheartedly believe, and certainly in competitions like that.
Where, then, would they say that the momentum is now?
"They went ahead with six points and now it's four, so we carry it as a little momentum, I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he ran away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, four points before and another twelve being played.
But the Americans feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a little wind in their sails and that there are many to encourage them, not at least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each recorded three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the base to the field of cleanliness and led by his example.
That shrink celebrations became harder as she had progressed around and he had sank a critical sethold to win four completely equally while he and Thomas were after two rounds with two behind.
She set who won the game at 15 for them was greeted with a similar scream, the kind that tells a man that he believes the American team has another chance.
"You really just have to take out everything and worry about your own game," said Spieth.
That is all that those players now have left.
18 wells to print their stamp.
The only players who have more scores than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the uncertainable story of the Rider Cup.
Europe’s unparent but charming couple got four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only few who not signed one on job numbers on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one on Saturday morning about job numbers as well as during the last nine Friday morning.
That loup, and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this excited crowd, confirms that they are the players to be called Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can clone a potential European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Select both at once or at different wells.
However, it is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s fourball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One keeps on track numbers and two doubles on the front nine, the Spaniard and the Sweed had landed into a hole from which they couldn't even come nearly.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four balls and four-game teams are so exciting to watch closely because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way a strategy can change into an eyewink.
To date, Europe has always played better as a team and has taken significant lead on the last day, but this four-game session has also shown that the U.S. team has the courage for the fight that some, especially at home, doubted.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead during the last day of the rider cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the rider cup after they came with an advantage of 10-6 from Saturday's four-ball and four-game games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score to four points so far at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who tries to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, has a American team that did not perform equally in the morning's four balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. was more resistant in the four games and won two games, but they did not shrink back.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 single game games to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newling who won four points in a row while he and Molinari, after a sensational weekend called "Moliwood", are only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup that recorded four points after their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they played excellently together to conquer a dad Woods and American new Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5 & 4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliantness, but he now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning's four balls, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the four games to a 2&1 layer for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - which are first and third on the world rankings.
However, on a pleasant day with a wind southwest of Paris, Europe did not always get their sense.
Jordan Spieth who won a great tournament three times and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They recorded a difficult 2&1 victory over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and later returned to hit Pulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four games after losing the first two wells.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder cup has a team restored a backdrop of four points when they enter the single game, even though Furyk's team just needs to play in parallel to keep the trophy because they already keep it.
After two days of their second best, however, they do not seem to succeed in a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says they will 'determine' unilaterally disarmed without confidence
North Korea’s Foreign Minister told the United Nations Saturday that continuing sanctions are worsening their suspicion of the United States and that the country will certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such qualities.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, breaking down the nuclear test area and promise not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We see, however, no corresponding reaction from the US," he said.
"Without any confidence in the U.S., there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will certainly not disarmament ourselves unilaterally first."
While Ri known North Korean complaints repeated about Washington's resistance to a "facing" approach to removing nuclear weapons for which North Korea would be rewarded if it took progressive steps, his words seemed significant because it did not unconditionally reject the unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a president of the U.S. and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim committed to work for the "destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to have a formal end of the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States said Pjongjang should give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington also resisted requests to soften strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. urges the "destruction of nuclear weapons first" and exerts more pressure by intensifying the level of the sanctions to achieve their goal in a forceful way, and even object to the 'declaration of the end of the war," said Ri.
"The press that sanctions can force us on our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are worsening our suspicion."
Ri didn't say anything about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump on which the U.S. leader mentioned the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings during the last five months between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added: "If the party in this issue was about destruction of nuclear weapons in South Korea and not the U.S., the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a dead point."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's talk was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN's General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's rakets would be directed on the US's land mass after "Mr. Bose President" Trump called Kim a "fire-pyler" on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to destroy North Korea "health," Kim abundantly commended for his courage for taking steps to disarmament, but he said that many work had to be done and that sanctions still have to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he did not have a timeframe for this, and said, "It doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pjongjang for the steps they have taken.
But, the U.S. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mike Pompeo, said Thursday to the UN Security Council that "application of sanctions by the Security Council must be diligent and without delay continue until we realize the complete, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously intensified sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to dry out funds for Pjongjang's nuclear and ballistic missionary programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and afterwards said that he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last journey was not well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said that progress was made, but North Korea only hours later accused him of setting "bendelike demands".
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon to break down a missile site and also to make a nuclear complex if the United States "compliant measures".
He said that Kim told him that the "according measures" he wanted to see are security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore as well as steps towards normalisation of relationship with Washington.
Harvard students follow a course over enough rest.
A new course at the Harvard University this year makes all of its pre-graduate students get more sleep in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of study through caffeine-driven 'heavy sessions'.
An academic found that students at the world’s top university are often uninformed when it comes to the basic principles of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicines at Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of his kind in the U.S.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep absorption on learning.
'At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why do they tell me this first, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had told her how important sleep was--that surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first presented this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleeping habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their general well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatrie at Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university’s health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had been seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves some interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping room, where students should click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books to be told about the effect of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is influenced by sleep defects and the importance of a sleep time routine.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep disability risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer can increase.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think of their daily routine.
'We know it won't change students' behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know-- just as you have the right to know the health effect of choosing cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to 'study' still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure that you get enough sleep of good quality, a student's 'secret weapon' should be to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said - even to avoid taking weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after last year, during his first year at Harvard, one of his classes.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to engage in a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' that are emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disturb your circadic rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal of Menga conquers Gerrard’s men
Rangers have experienced another sarsie out of the day when Dolly Menga's target head Steven Gerrard's unharmed team caused a defeat of 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to win their first as visitors since February 4-1-sege at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only submitted to Gerrard his second defeat in 18 matches as manager so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which was loosely preceded in the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before resting, and it didn't seem like a Rangers team would play without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to the sixth position, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind Hibernian on target differences.
And there may be further difficulty for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after an object seemed to be thrown from the way.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that stormed past Ayr to the end of the Betfred cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been in his nops with the way his well-trained team had smothered their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They must actually have recorded after just two minutes when Menga's first deposition Scott Pittman sent through on Allan McGregor's purpose, but the middle field player opened its great chance.
A deep freeshead by Keaghan Jacobs then found captain Craig Halkett but his defense mate Alan Lithgow could only miss at the back of the target stake.
Rangers took control, but there seemed more hope than belief about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt that he had to have a penalty goal at the quarter point when he and Steven Lawless crashed, but the divorce judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian requests.
Rangers managed to get only two shots to the target during the first half but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly was hardly plagued by Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and a tame target head of Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s openmaker at the 34th minute may have been at the direction of play, no one can deny that they had earned it, even though it was only for their hard work.
Once again, Rangers did not handle a deep piece of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who had stayed cool and sent it to Menga for a simple rounding.
Gerrard acted at the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but chased the impressive Kelly from his strip to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the type of game they enjoy, with Lithgow and Halkett, who picked long ball after long ball.
Holt’s team could have increased its advantage in the last stages, but McGregor was well up to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could get wide from the corner.
Rangers' substitute Glenn Middleton had another late demand for a penalty when he collapsed with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday morning almanak: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and our TEL VERDER ... the day the future physicist John Wilhelm "Hans" was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geigerteller.
Since then, the Geigerteller has been a support pillar of science, and it has also become a support pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado," in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
Man: "What is this on earth?"
Rogers: "It's a Geigerteller used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put up these earphones, you can even hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it's cracking about!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see robbery cells'
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' robbery cells and kill them.
Fuel teaches immune system to identify robbery cells as part of treatment
Methods involve withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory.
They can then see a protein common to many cancers and then inject it again.
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, teaching the immune system to identify robber cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing it into the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that occurs in many cancers and is called HER2, and then to inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarial, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to remove immune cells from patients and to "learn" them how to attack cancer cells worked to hit a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West began a pro-Trump ridicule after his action on SNL, while he wore a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was poured out in the studio during a Saturday night live after an extensive action in which he believed the U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would preferably put him in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, which is called Ghost Town and during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support from Trump.
"I talk to a white man so often and they said, "How can you like Trump, he's a racsis?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have moved from America long ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate’s judicial committee on accusations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Even though it was not broadcast, the image material of West’s scum was loaded on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It was unclear whether Rock tried to ridicule West by placing it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the platform about what he had carried on his head.
"They pierced me behind the platform.
They said, 'do not go out with that hat.'
They pissed me!
And then they say I'm in a low place," he said according to the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead, "Will you see the low place?" and said that he would dress his "super man's coat, because this means that you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
At least twice, his comment attracted an excitement from the audience and members of the SNL rolling division seemed embarrassed, reported Variety, with one person there who said to the publication: "The whole studio has become silent."
West was introduced as a late substitute for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, the zipper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who enforced: "To one of the most courageous spirits: DANKY THAT YOU ARE THE SKARE."
But chatting program guest Karen Hunter twitted that West was just "who he is and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I have chosen to not reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") which I believe accept and proclaim a ideology that threatens my community.
He's free.
We too," she added.
Before the show, the zipper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the being that once known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
He was named Snoop Lion, and, of course, his name changed to a symbol and then to the artist who had previously been known as Prince.

The charge will be revised by the public prosecution service.
Game of Thrones-ster Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword - swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
Kit talked to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believed 'something went wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he felt 'reasonably strong' about making work on this issue.
'I personally feel quite strong about it at the moment--where did we go wrong with masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up with regard to the problem that we now see?'
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth of toxic masculine because of its extremely male characters.
He continued: "What is inborn and what was taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that cause young boys to feel that they should have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think it really is one of the big questions in our time - how do we change it?
Because something obviously went wrong with our young men."
in the interview he also admitted that he will not participate in any of the Game of Thrones-fore-and-consequences when the series next summer comes to an end, for he says he is 'ready with battlefields and horses'.
From November on, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard's True West, which is the story of a movie manufacturer and his brother, who is a robber.
Recently, the actor revealed that he thought that the best thing that came from Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this program, so in that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit’s character Jon Snow, in the Emmy - crowned fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the site of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China report a 14% increase in new cases
China announced that there is a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported alone in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted by sex, representing a change in the past.
Traditionally, HIV rapidly spreads through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who got HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living in China with HIV and AIDS increased with 100,000 people.
HIV transmission by sex is a critical matter in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to work on the matter.
Maxine Waters denyses that a staff member has leaked the data of GOP-senators, condemns 'dangerous lies' and 'collaborative theories'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters went out Saturday against claims that a member of her staff placed the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the accusations were driven by "ultrarights" experts and websites.
"Leys, lies, and still detestable lies," said Waters in an explanation on Twitter.
The information selected is said to have included the home addresses and telephone numbers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, placed by an unknown person on the Capitol hill during the Senate panel's trial on the claims of sexual misconduct against the appointed for the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh.
The lek took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the locations relates to Waters' office and announced the information of a member of Waters' staff, reported the Hill.
"This unfounded claim is totally false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff-- whose identity, personal information and security were put at risk as a result of this deceptive and false claim--was at all not responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unfounded claim is totally false and an absolute lie."
Waters’ statement soon attracted criticism online, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
"This denial testifies to anger," wrote Fleischer.
"It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the Congress.
When accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
He should not be challenging.
He should not question the motives of the prosecutor.
He must be calm and calm."
Fleischer apparently compared Waters ’ reaction with the democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, accused by critics of seemingly angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tried to light Waters in the interchange of the cushions, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if it's true," he twittered.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these deceptive claims.
"We will make sure that the managers are exposed," she continued, "and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Flou Rowan Atkinson Spying
It's traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new movie with a British impact and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comethe spotteryfranchise - which started with Johnny English in 2003 and struggled further with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-kicks even more on the subject of how obvious power we are the nation's new export event?
In any case, the unarmed Johnny English with his outpeuls and rubber face had his license to waste everything up for the second time renewed--and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he was a great comic creation for non-English-speaking film audiences.
Of course, he is the ridiculous secret agent who despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean and a good sketch of that old who contributed a single note to the chariots or fire-made song at the publicity of the London Olympic Games in 2012.
He was originally based on the traveler and international man of puzzles, leaving chaos behind him, which Atkinson once played in the narrowly forgotten Barclaycard advertisements.
There are one or two nice moments in this latest version of YE.
I liked Johnny English who came to a helicopter as he was dressed in a middle-century gun garment and shortly cut the screw sheets against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is shown but the humor feels fairly faint and strangely obscure, especially when the "serious" film trade marks such as 007 and Mission Impossiblely now self comedy with self-confidence as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it is aimed on children rather than on adults, and for me, Johnny English’s adversity is not as originally and focused as Atkinson’s silent flaps in the persona of Bean.
The eternal thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious difficulty.
A cuber craker infiltrated Britain's supersecret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, until the upset of the agent to service - a sad little roll for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a prime minister who is a puffed and besieged character, who already experiences a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there's only little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since each active spy has been put at risk, she must call out someone from his retirement.
And that means the struggling Johnny English itself, now in service as a teacher at some decent institution, but which gives from the record lessons about how to be a secret agent, there are some nice jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spying school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency command and is reunited with his former long - suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married with a submarine deputy, an allamapstic role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
So the Batman and Robin are totally waste everything in Her Majesty’s secret service and come down to Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme of fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister ends under the dangerous enchantment of the charismatic technology billionary who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the mysterious Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their journey of ridiculous eskapades: mutilated as clingers they burn a French restaurant, cause their chaos when they take themselves on board Volta’s luxury smoking; and English causes pure anarchy to break off when he tries to use a headpiece for virtual reality to become familiar with the inside of Volta's house.
For that last scene, nothing is saved, but as ugly and excited as it may be, the whole affair is quite much like child TV.
Reasonably moderate.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't stop thinking: couldn't the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really makes his talent come to his right?
Work denying that it's a plan for British to work a four-day week but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Worker Party has to consider a drastic plan that will cause Britts to work a four-day work--but is paid for five days.
The party is said to want company bases savings caused by the artificial intelligence (KI) revolution to workers by spending their extra day.
It'll make workers enjoy a three-day weekend--but they'll still take the same payment home.
Sources say that it will 'fit' at the party's economic agenda and plans to set the country in the favor of the workers.
To change to a four-day week has been signed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to use the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party Source told The Sunday Times: A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits into the party's approach to rebalance the economy in favour of the worker as well as to the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Workers Party will not be the first to sign such an idea, with the Green Party who, during his campaign for the general election in 2017, promised a four-day work week.
The ambition, however, is currently not supported by the entire Workers Party.
A spokesman of the Workers Party said: 'A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not considered by the party.'
Shadu Minister John McDonnell used the Workers Conference last week to grasp his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from 'sensitive directors' and 'winners' to service companies.
The shadow minister's plans also meant that current shareholders in water companies may not recover their entire investment since a labour government can make 'deductions' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on directories of companies and to create including ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private businesses to employees, who can get annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh can make them change their opinions.
The FBI's investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh had a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court with delayed at least a week and raises the question whether the bureau's findings could convince any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked for Republican census. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked if the FBI could deepen anything that could make them change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more responsive than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, certainly, unambiguous."
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be unchangeable.
"I formed my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an accusation of dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know it: Brett zealously denied it," Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I see nothing new change."
What is the World Citizen Festival and has done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the World Citizens Festival, an annual musical event that has a particularly impressive group of stars that act and have an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
World Citizens are now in its seventh year, and during the festival, tens of thousands of people will stream to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only actions by Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes but also to create awareness for the opportunity’s real purpose to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Army Project, an international prominence group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free card to the opportunity (unless you are willing to pay for a BBP card), concerters had to carry out a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteer work, send an e-mail to a world leader, make a phone call or any other significant way to create awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But just how successful was World citizen with 12 years left to reach his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, a good way to convince people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "kliktivisime" - people who feel that they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a twi?
Since 2011, World citizen says that it has recorded over 19 million "actions" of its supporters, which support a multitude of different goals.
It says that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to over $37 billion that will potentially affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion had already been paid out or collected.
The group estimates that the confirmed money has so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to "helping children to reach their full potential," and promise to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 twentieths from World citizens.
"With the support of the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," said Power of Nutrition-ambassador Tracey Ullman in April 2018 during a concert in London to the crowd.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions done to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website that asks "What makes you think that we can end extreme poverty?"
World citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road-- sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will be successful, because we have more power together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who act at this year's event in New York, which will be offered by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. can use fleet for "blockcade" to prevent exports of Russian energy - minister of domestic affairs
"If necessary," Washington could leave him on his fleet to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, the U.S. minister of domestic affairs revealed Ryan Zinke, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Sinks claimed Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where it works at the invitation of the legal government - is a pretext to investigate new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just as in Eastern Europe, the south of Europe," he reportedly said.
And, according to a officer, there are ways and means to tackle them.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the seaways are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy does not land on the market," he said.
Zinks addressed the attendees of an occasion offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without profits that views themselves as the "stem of the energy consumer" in the U.S.A.
He continued to compare Washington’s approaches to the handling of Russia and Iran and noticed that they were practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel," he said while he referred to Russia as a "enkeltalent" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
The statements come as Trump administration was on a mission to give the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe a hup push to replace Russia, far from the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, the Trump administration's officials, including American president Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump Berlin Moscow's "founded" project.
Moscow repeatedly emphasized that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a pure economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition of the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exercising pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," said Russian Minister of Energy, Alexander Novak, after a meeting with the American Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. views provoked antireaction from Germany, which reaffirmed their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI) called on them to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will consider it seriously to be president in 2020, said the senator of Massachusetts.
Massachusetts' senator, Elizabeth Warren, said Saturday she would consider it "very seriously" to stand as president after the middle-term elections.
During a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts confirmed Warren that she would consider standing.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and correct our crushed government and it includes a woman in the highest sport," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider standing for President."
Warren aired her opinion on President Donald Trump during the village meeting and said he "taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm up to my inner concern about what Donald Trump does to our democracy," she said.
Warren was very pronounced in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a twentieth Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need a FBI examination before our voice."
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own choosers don't think she should stand in 2020.
Eight and fifty percent of "probably" Massachusetts-choosers said the senator should not stand, according to Suffolk University of Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he had to stand potentially and 48 against it.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed in order to possibly stand in 2020 include former fishe president Joe Biden and Vermont's senator Bernie Sanders.
Prayer said he would decide officially in January, reported the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump Convention
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined in September.
He was arrested Monday evening and accused of an incident of domestic violence.
"What my own son passes through, which he passed through since he returned, I had sympathy with other families who felt the consequences of PTSV and the injuries with which our soldiers return," she told an audience at a convention for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a little different, they came back hard, they came back and wondered if there was the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air forces and any other member of the army gave the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of household violence, assault of a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a gun while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Station.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the County of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new US policy that refuses asylum to victims who flee from gang or household violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the county submitted a friend-of-the- court jurisdiction Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, reported NBC News.
The full name of the emperor in the Grace v. Sessions contested by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not made public.
She said her partner "and his violent gang-member sons," abused her, but American officials refused her request for asylum on July 20.
She was held in Texas.
The state attorneys who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, who produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing deep problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US Asian policy reversed in 2014 a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals (Council of Immigrant Apps) which allowed immigrants to apply for asylum without the necessary documents that had fled from domestic violence.
Distrik Columbia's lawyer-general Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy "ignoring the state, federal and international laws."
"Federal laws require that all asylum applications be determined on the specific facts and circumstances of the demand, and such advocacy violates that policy," said the friend-of-the-court jurisdiction.
Attorneys have further argued in the legal order that the policy that refuses access to immigrants damages the US economy and says it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and "provide necessary labor."
In June, lawyer-general Jeff Sessions commissioned immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims who flee from domestic and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership to a specific social group or political opinion," said Sessions in his announcement of policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to relieve all problems — not even all serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while death doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly nypendent.
"It feels very stressed," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma while she comforted her fevery baby boy at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce."
Residents have been seen returning to their destructed homes, searching for throughdrenched possessions, trying to save anything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overwhelmed, damaged by the 7.5 range of tremor.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who got a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu’s military hospital where patients are treated outside because of constant strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth floor hotel room that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls' ruins, I think," said Haris to Associated Press and added that he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S.ambassador accused China of bullying with Propaganda Advertisement
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in an American daily commending the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the U.S. ambassador for China accused Peking of the US press being used to distribute propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily's paid inset in the Des Moines Register – the State of Iowa’s newspaper with most sales – after he accused China of having intervened at the United States Congress elections of 6 November, a complaint that denied China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters, a new phase in an increasing campaign by Washington was to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in an escalating trade war that led to making their tariff rounds equal to each other's imports.
China’s retaliation rates early in the trade war were intended to strike exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, said Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador for China and the former governor of Iowa for a long time, a large exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, wrote Branstad in a commentary in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "reass the bullying by publishing propaganda advertisements in our own free press."
"Through the spread of their propaganda, the Chinese government grabs America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk in the street here in Beijing, a person will find very limited deviation of voices and will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China’s most prominent newspapers had shunned from the offer to publish his article," although he did not say what newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's electors before elections with Kavanaugh debakel, warn analysts
While many top republics stand at the Supreme Court-genominated Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various claims of sexual assault, analysts warned that they would see contradiction during the coming elections, especially of women.
The emotions about this are enormously high, and most Republicans are on record that they already indicate that they want to continue with the mood.
Those things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School to The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s encouragement for a FBI examination on the little will be enough to appease severe choosers.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group of MoveOn Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
Friday morning protesters "November is on the way!" cried as they argued in the entrance hall of the Senate, while the Republicans who chose the Judiciary Committee to continue with Kavanaugh's appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst to the news site.
"People say it was already high; that's true.
But it may be higher, especially among swinging-female electors in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who do not often vote because they don't like the president."
Even before Ford's public evidence explaining the details of her accusation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court-genominated, analysts said that analysts could follow an opposition if Republicans continued to confirm.
"It became a tremendous junk for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee's voice or the final voice or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the court, it's also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to prefer Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with slightly more to choose the latter’s side.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents decide or probably believe Ford's testimony, while 35 say they certainly or probably believe for Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said that they think Kavanaugh probably yoked or definitively during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s encouragement, the FBI is currently examining the accusations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainer, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate’s Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh attacked her at the age of 17, while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court of Justice revealed its gender parts to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to start a new Internet to tell Google and Facebook the fight
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, leads an initial existence that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee mocked that the idea with Inrupt was "world control".
"We must do it now," he said of the project.
"This is a historical moment."
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, playlists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional utilities.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique to the personal online data storage is that it is entirely based on the user who can gain access to that type of information.
The company calls it "personal authentication through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company’s HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes, and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week on, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications by using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about the announcement of a total change, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a posting on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while he runs Inrupt, Berners-Lee will still remain the founder and director of the Worldwide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm greatly optimistic about this next era of the web," added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoriakruis-Geistliche gefeiert
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a fighter during World War I was venerated 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt.kol honored Bernard Vann won the award in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
But four days later, he was killed by a sharp shooter and never knew that he had acquired the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was revealed Saturday by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "briljant symbolic" that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather's crowned achievement.
According to the London Gazette, lt.kol. From September 29, 1918, his battalion led over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the fire line and led the line forward with the "greatest braveness" before he stormed man-only a fighting gun and knocked out three of the department.
Lt.kol Vann was killed on October 4, 1918 by a German shooter – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's action is "something I know I can never respect, but something that is humiliating."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid a cliff to the parades, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said, "feel honored to play a role in the parades," and added that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the support given by a lot of people."
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just not to watch the main event.
The program of San Jose contained 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to tell each other the battle, viewers were left stupid in the UK when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake specially for the fight until early hours.
One supporter on Twitter described the transition to the child cartoon as "one or other sick joke."
"It is government regulation that the content was not suitable at 6:00 p.m. and therefore they had to switch to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when he was asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company's president Scott Coker said they would work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think of the remission, I think we can probably work out something," said Coker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday there and we won't be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we work on it.
Believe me, when it switched over, there were many texts that were sent back and forth, and it wasn't all kind.
We tried to correct it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that this will not happen next time.
We will limit it to five fights instead of six – as we normally make – and we have tried to offer more to our adherents and just pass over our time.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley's feelings about sexuality are 'sensitive'
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with a feeling of inferiority about his sexuality – but it gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize before he went to high school that "not all are like me."
When he talked on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs offered by Lauren Laverne, he said he shouted his feelings about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that becoming a parent made him less care about winning at the Olympic Games.
The regular provider of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, took off a few months because of disease.
When he appeared as a dwindling on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "lesser" than everyone else when he grew up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to love boys and girls."
He said: "To this day those feelings of less than, and feel different, the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so he disappointed no one when they would finally learn about his sexuality.
The double olympic bronze medal winner became a high profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year's Statebond games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminate homosexuality.
He says that he has excited his feelings because he is so happy to be able to live openly without consequences and to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that to become in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – "has caught him out of hand."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, which is 20 years older than he, but says the age difference has never been a matter.
"When you endure so much at such a young age" – he went to his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar height and low points.
The couple had become parents in June of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said she had changed "all perspective."
"If you asked me last year, everything went about 'I must win a gold medal," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked if they had already had tickets for London 2012 – for he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad'," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed about for my life – to dive before my homes at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection — Proud by Heather Small — who also resoneed with him in building up the Olympic Games and still gives him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson isn't drifting and withdrawing from Saturday’s Rider Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th rider cup game, but he will have to manage his form to prevent it from being a unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record-- 12th time in the two-yearly event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Fureich for Saturday's four-ball games and quarters.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-fold Major winner will divide his day between it to be racing and working on the exercise jack at his game in the hope of correcting what skeletons.
Even at the climax of his career, he was never the straightest driver, so the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National career where the long rupee always punishes the violating blows.
And as if the job on its own was not challenging enough, Mickelson came to stand Sunday in his ninth competition against the accurate British Ope champion Francesco Molinari, who worked together with new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four their competitions this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start the 12 single game games well, Mickelson’s competition can be absolutely vital.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a knock on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has much confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroe Hall, and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn’t think he would play two games.
I had more prospects, but that's how things worked out and that's what we thought we had to do.
He wants to be there on the track, just like anyone else."
Mickelson will exceed Sunday Nick Faldo’s record for the player who played most rider cup games.
It can mark the end of a rider cup career that never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven halfs, although Fureich said that his presence had contributed to the team incredible aspects.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, caught, like to shave the crazy, and he's a wonderful old to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just game."
Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows great advantage can soon disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant advantage before the last day's single game in the rider cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made its debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where the team under the direction of Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point advance, but only nail crab won with 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"A man keeps on reminding himself that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail crab," Bjorn said, on the picture, after he looked at how the class of 2018 won 5-3 and was yesterday 10-6 before at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone to the team that it isn't over.
You'll be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a purpose, and it is to try to win the trophy, and that's where the focus remains.
I still say, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are also well aware of who stands on the other side – the best players in the world."
Rejoicing about how his players sailed on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: "I will never progress with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of another colour.
Tomorrow it's the individual participation that comes in turn, and it's a horse of a different color.
It is wonderful to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you are individually there, you are tested to your full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you have to pass on to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your mate behind, and he must also put the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk would want his players to fare better individually than they did as gamemates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of that great last day, where he was part of the wishpan at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe won the "wonder of Medinah".
"I remember every covering word of it," he said in reply when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 spoke up courage to his players on the way to that last day.
"We have 12 major matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as Brookline was seen, as was seen at Medinah.
When that momentum begins to go in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle contests.
We set up our team accordingly, and divided the men that we felt, you know, will bring us a magic tomorrow."
Thomas got the task of trying to lead the counterattack and comes into the main contest against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the upper half of the classification.
"I chose this group of boys in this order, for I think it covers it to the end," Bjorn said about his single game options.
Germany’s New Warship Suspended Again
The German military's latest fregat would have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War Era, but it would not be there until at least next year, because of faulty systems and growing costs, reports local media.
The use of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the headship of the splinterneue Baden-Wuerttemberg-Klasse fregatte has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit-Render who quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel must have joined the Navy in 2014, but the disturbing post delivery issues afflicted this ambitious project's lot.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that ordered the Fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class fregatts.
It is understood that they will have a powerful canon, a battle order of air defense and anti-ship missionaries as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to evolve the latest freight for up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuing delays mean that by the time they enter into service, the advanced warships — evidently enabling Germany to project power overseas — will already be obsolete by calling The Time.
The disastrous F125 fregat made records last year when the German Navy officially refused to employ the vessel and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media mentioned that a number of essential "software and hardware defects" make the ship useless if it is completed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half of the men force on older Bremen-class fregatts.
It also revealed that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing the performance and reducing the Fleet’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7 000 tons of "Rheinland-Pfalz" are thought to be double as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price label for the entire project — including the training of the crew — also touched a question.
Apparently, it has reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that the new fregats have bited become especially important in view of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy's "ships that can be completed are getting up."
The officer said that the issue had worsened over time, for old ships were put out of service, but no substitute vessels were provided.
He mourned that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Listens to Fledermuses ’ Secret Life
New research is carried out on a estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help to lead future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano - wing bat as well as the brown long - ear and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed on important locations on the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile recordings by using hand indicators.
Exclusive clan channels of all surveys will verify the regularity of the bats and determine which species do what.
A Habitat card and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS hopes the results will reveal the areas of the habitat for the bats the most important and how it is used by each of the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, bat populations have declined significantly during the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects sleeping and loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as fly paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Fledermuses are not really blind.
But because of their nighttime hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to show gambling gas and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres [1,000 ha] of land throughout the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly perform surveys and sleeping - place inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reservation at Threave land in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Country Manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal site for them.
"Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitat.
But there is so much about bats still unknown, so the work we do here and on other property helps us to understand better what they need to flourish."
He emphasizes the necessity of searching for bats before conservation in property is done because ignorant destruction of a single farm can mean up to 400 females and young ones' death and can eradicate a whole local population.
Fledermuses are protected, and killing, disturbing, or preventing, or destroying their sleeping places is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are."
Ronaldo deduces rape claims while lawyers prepare to marry German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo made rape claims against him as "false news" and said that people "will promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to marry German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, who published the claims.
Portugal and Juventus were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet over the inside, reported Der Spiegel Friday.
In an Instagram Live video in which he addressed his 142 million followers, hours after the claims, Ronaldo, 33, finished the reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, false news," said the five-time Ballon d'Or-winter to the camera.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the whole thing.
I am a happy man and everything is right," the player added smilingly.
Ronaldo’s attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the claim, which, according to Reuters, they called "inaccessible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy".
Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for "moral compensation for any amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious infringements of personal rights in recent years."
The claimed inn took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player’s room, where he reportedly raped her anal, according to documents submitted at Clark County Districthof in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell down on his knees after the alleged inside and said he was "99 percent" a "good old" that was abandoned by the "one percent."
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex but that it was consistent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "angry for retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she wants to turn the settlement now because she was still traumatized by the alleged inside.
Ronaldo was about to join from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a €100 million agreement, to the Italian giants, Juve.
Brexit: UK will lose 'forever repentance' if their car manufacturers lose
The UK 'will be repentant forever' if they lose their status as a world leader in automobile production to Brexit, said corporate secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is "comfortable" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without agreement, it would have to temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the case of a non-compliance broxit, could cost posts.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see how production is stopped in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Governing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK motor manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have fears of leaving the EU without agreement and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW said, for example, that they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month to Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what automobile manufacturers say to supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without a agreement.
Toyota's production line runs on a "only time" basis, with parts that arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without agreement on 29 March, there may be disturbance on the border that the industry says can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will be stopped.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relationships with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid those controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that, as I say, will allow not only the current success, but for us to grab this opportunity," he said to BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The indications of not only Toyota but also other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to continue with what was a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production will be stopped, but warned that in the long term, added costs could reduce the investment’s competitiveness and eventually cost posts.
Peter Tsouvallar, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union's convocator on the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these posts disappear, they never come back again.
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House.
Donald Trump's high-risk meeting with adjunct-general Rod Rosenstein can be "deferred with another week" while the fighting about nominated for the High Court of Justice Brett Kavanaugh continued, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who examines the Russian electoral interference, links between Trump helpers and Russia, and possible crossbombing of the right by the president.
Whether Trump is going to dismiss the adjunct-general or not, and Mueller’s independence threatens them for months has encouraged Washington’s cheerful tours.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to take up conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, in the midst of reports that he was on his way to quit.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "choose not to thank" for Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate court's trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both witnessed.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI examination of claims against Kavanaugh and postponed the full Senate vote further.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Sunday on Fox News.
When she was asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said: "A date for it has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see that it is postponed with another week with all the other things that go on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some journalists would differ with that statement: Sanders haven't held a White House press information session since September 10th.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarceness of information sessions is not because of a reluctance for TV journalists who are "efficient hunting", although she said, "I won't fight with the fact that they are effective."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would grow.
"The president held more V&A sessions than any president before him," she said, and added without quoting evidence: "We have looked at the numbers."
Information sessions will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this a lot and you've seen it a lot in the past few weeks and it's going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignity deputies.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making an unbonded and sometimes, bishop appearing before journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff in Scotland’s NHS work to show the country's gratitude and to express the wish that they would stay to Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdraw from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed them to covering costs of dealt with status applications for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: " During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government also intensified their preparations for a possible gene agreement scenario.
I know it is for all of you a very disturbing time.
That is why I want to repeat how much I appreciate each member’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Collegas from across the EU and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit from the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home, and we very much want you to stay here.
Christion Aberrombie undergoes emergency surgery after major injuries
Tennessee State Tigers' line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he had suffered a major injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Tennessee team's Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s chief coordinator Rod Reed told journalists that the injuries had taken place shortly before resting.
"He came to the sideline and sort of just collapsed there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken backwards for further evaluation.
An official of Tennessee State said to Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is out of the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are "no details about the type/range of injuries" and Tennessee is still trying to discover when the injuries occurred.
Butcrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he took five times to death before leaving the game, which brings his total for the season on 18 death vessels.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young choosers
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Thesaurus expects to collect up to £120 million a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK – with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to move young electors with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to combat homelessness.
In addition to the current seal tax, the added tax, including the higher levels established two years ago on second homes and houses purchased to rent, can be as much as three percent.
The Thesaurus expects that the move can bring up to £120 million a year.
A estimated 13 percent of newly built London's equations are purchased by non-UK citizens who push the prices up and make it harder for first buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become "spooking towns" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes only weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in seal tax to help more young people possess their first home.
He accused large building companies of keeping property prices high by raising land, but not using it, and encouraged Mrs May to dispose of quotas on affordable homes to restore Britain's "house disaster".
Mr. Corbyn announced a striking series of proposed housing improvements, including rent management and an end to "no-error-outs".
He also wants to give advice greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: " Last year I said I would devote my prime ministership to restoration of the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And it means repairing our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live here, work and build a life.
But it cannot be right that it is just as easy for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign - based companies to buy homes as for hardworking British inhabitants.
To too many people, the dream of household ownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness has become an too great reality."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to drive Scotland."
Sunderland-master Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland at a time.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of blowing new life in the North East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after leading back to the Scottish Prime Ministership last season of St Mirren.
"I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I took the second team, but it was all," said Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But I, as a child, often looked with my father for Scotland at Hampden and that's something that draws me back.
However, the opportunity can only come if I am successful in club management."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety to imitate such established names at such a large club, after he had previously rejected presentations of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by ''Can I let this club return to the Prime League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it must be in the Premier-liga," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get it there, but I'll probably only see myself as successful if I can get the club out again."
Ross' career in the management is only three years, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts' train staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and St Mirren from on the edge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playground at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a true crossroad," he said when he recalled how he had taken over Alloa's pipes.
"I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
This sounds bisar, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence of it, and experienced reasonable peaks.
But the game can be difficult.
There are many things that need to come weekly.
I still go through it in terms of the stress and pressures of the work, but driving just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable I was in my own skin throughout my adult life."

The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars ’ income but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking and grocery groups saw sales rising by 2.7% in July — but reception in restaurants was down by 4.8 percent, figures showed.
Peter Martin, of business consulting company CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "Continued sunshine and England’s longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that Julye followed a similar pattern as the previous month, June, when drinking places were up with 2.8 percent, besides that restaurants were even worse hit.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Drinking - guided drinking places and bars did better at far and increased more than restaurants had dropped.
Food-drinking places also suffered in the sun, but not as bad as restaurant operators
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Overruned bars and drinking places increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food was down by three percent."
Paul Newman, of recreation and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the tendency that we have seen since the end of April.
Again and the impact of major social or sports events remains the largest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-house market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent per year will be particularly difficult above and except constant cost pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-driven operators and only the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief."
Total sales growth throughout drinking places and restaurants, including new places that opened up, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the desire in trademark presentations.
The Coffer Peach Tracker business sales monitor for the UK’s drinking, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 business groups, with a combined turnover of more than £9 billion and is the established measure in the business.
One out of five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
One out of five children – some as young as 11 – has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers reveal a survey
Survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "false Insta pages"
The news has increased fears of placing sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a "main account" to show parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed rapid growth in "fals Insta accounts" – a reference to the Instagram photo portion.
The news has increased fears of placing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean "main account" to show parents, but also have private accounts.
One mother who came down on her 13-year-old daughter's secret yard found a teenager who encourages others to "rape her."
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them who admit that they have private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces online where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Eilidh Doyle will be "stem for athletes" on Scottish Athletic Board.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the advice of Scottish Atletics as a non-executing director at the control body's general annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated job-and-veldatleet and chairman Ian Beattie described the step as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sports to benefit from her far-reaching experience at international level during the past decade.
"Eilidh has great respect throughout the Scottish, UK and world athletic society and we are certainly athletic in Scotland will benefit very much from what she brings to the advice," said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I am eager to act as a voice for athletes I and hope I can really contribute and help to lead sports in Scotland."
The American, who had the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four golden Olympic medals, was now a regular BBC expert, couldn't walk after he had a short-term Icekemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today a month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors just said the time would learn whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but fully recovered, again learned how to walk, and today perform skill exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Breast pump advertisement comparing mothers with cows divides on-line opinions
A breast pump company distributed online with an advertisement comparing breast - feeding mothers with cows milked.
In celebrating the lead of what is called the "world's first quietly portable breast pump," consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-knit music video-inspired advertisement to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers that milk out.
Four right mothers dance in a barn full of straw and cows on the size of a song that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see a tail" and "If you don't see, it's not uiers, it's my breasts."
The choir section says, "Pumps it out, pump it out, I execute the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies."
But the advertisement published on the company's Facebook page caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of remarks, the video received mixed reaction from viewers, with many who say that it undermines the "greeves" of the dairy industry.
"Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
We must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of birth," wrote one.
The Elvie burst pump fits discreet in a nutrient bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person noted: "Conceptually traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "The advertisement is so out of feeling."
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman who admitted that the song was for her "crying naked."
"I think it's a genius idea.
I would have had one if I had kept breastfeeding.
To milk out, I felt like a cow.
The advertisement is a bit mad, but I accepted it for what it is.
It's a genius product," wrote one.
Another person noted: "It's a fun advertisement directed on mothers who milk out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows".
It is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pump in their bracelets.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into a nutritional bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they milk out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD by Mother noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a large and appealing release.
By drawing a parallel between women who milk out and dairy cows, we wanted to place the milking process and all its challenges in the collision, while we in an entertaining way that people can find joining demonstrate the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump got the news.
During London Modeweek a mother of two appeared on the loop board for designer Martha Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of persistent migrant children has risen sharply, although monthly borders remained relatively unchanged, partly because of fierce rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration, which makes it more difficult to put children into deposits.
Traditionally, most funds were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country was threatened by acting forward to demand a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential funds and other adult members of their households should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week Matthew Albence, an senior official at Immigration and customs enforcement before the Congress, testified that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor uncommon minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal records.
"Amper 80 percent of the individuals who are sponsors or household members of borgs are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
Therefore, we continue to persecute those individuals," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month after arrest, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to appeal their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are considered inappropriate for relief will be quickly deported.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they will become anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent eruptions or escape efforts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Advocates say that these concerns are increased at a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child struggles are easier to be missed because of the size.
They added that moving the children to the town of tents without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say good - bye to friends can make the trauma that many have already struggled.
Syria tells United States, French and Turkish ‘occupying forces’ to withdraw immediately
When he addressed the UN General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem also appealed to Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war was in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian ground, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be "treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said to the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with more millions displaced, have been "amper over".
He said that Damascus would continue "to carry this sacred battle until we purified all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States trained and advised about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly against Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war - tormented land.
As regards the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions are all right for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for spreading "irrational fears that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to fascinate this return," he said.
"They polite something that just must be a humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomas said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebellion of Idlib, created an opportunity to continue with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement rejected a large-scale attack by Russian-supported Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem emphasized that the agreement had "clear spercies" and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors of the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front that would be "cut off".
UN Messenger, Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon bring together the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to establish a post-war constitution for Syria and set up the way to elections.
Moualem prescribed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said that the panel's work should be limited to the "compliance with the articles of the current Constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberals probably hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidency early.
In what without doubt "the most dramatic final of a presidency will ever be!"
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing figures have doubled more than to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million peak-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is top cable viewers with as many as 3.5 million viewers on large news nights.
"It's a fire that people are attracted to, for it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC-drama "Designed Survivor" about a cabin secretary who becomes president after an attack destroying the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The manager told her that he would vote to Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, "Because he let me laugh," said me. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the Washington story lines can reunite the future of Roe v Wade, or immigrant families, and the health of the world economy.
Turning off is a luxury that can afford only the most privileged viewers.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you're in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" from his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather-fly jacket ("a garment thick of the hubris," said The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniels' shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
For example, I will never again look at Super Mario in the same way.
"Some of what he does that makes it feel like a reality program is that he feeds you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump program's changing role division and daily chinkels in the plot (as to seek dispute with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode, otherwise you'll stay behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his house on the north coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC as he took CNN.
He could not break away, not with Brett Kavanaugh was on the way to appear before the Senate’s Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on the scale.
"I remember when we did all those mad programs at that time and people said, 'That is the beginning of the end of the Western civilization,' said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was kind of a joke, but it seems now they were right."

Outside money flows to the most exciting middle-term election races in Home
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th sees an influx of money, due to a shift of districts that have now left two officials into a race for the same seat.
The recently changed suburb Pittsburg district makes democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election past spring – measure forces.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavy overlapping with the new 17th.
The cards were withdrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the ancient districts were unlawfully defined in the Republicans ’ favor.
The race in the new 17th abolished with a campaign financing competition between the large parties’ financial legs, the Democratic Veldtog Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Veldtog Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a famous name in Pennsylvania after a nail scraps win in a wide viewed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat was held for more than a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts have given the democrats a slightly advantage.
U.S. considered penalizing El Salvador rather than supporting China but then turned back
Diplomate noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already acknowledged Beijing, with little opposition to Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners disfellowshipped the Trump Organization's management team.
Officials of the government departments decided to call back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama on the "new decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the Department’s spokesman, earlier this month in a statement.
But fines were considered only against El Salvador, who received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including drug control, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, including reduction in financial assistance and timing visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high level congress, focusing on security and economic progress to follow a similar convention last year which was considered a step forward in an attempt to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the congress to continue to bring an effective end to any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Adjunct President Mike Pence is now determined to speak to the congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the seriousness of the convention for the administration, the diplomas said.
And the three American messengers returned silently to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new horrible messages or rigs from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton did not wish to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomas, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an out-analyst that was close to the administration and also spoke about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing can happen can be the special discussion on Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible cross - bombing of the court, which is now very significant in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is thought to also focus his examination on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia worked in the country’s attack on our elections.
If the Congress would pass into other hands, Mr. Trump would have to face accountability in that body, just when he prepares to go again before the ecclesiastes, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers' group.
It's a lot of axes, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable – nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
There are decisions to be taken on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, which will influence the extent to which the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938 German officials were ready to carry out a state grip against Hitler, if the West only opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history is centered around such pitches and democracy’s medious course.
Americans are now faced with various such turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump adjunct-general Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation, dismisses?
Rosenstein had been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed to take the president secretly and speculate whether he was competent for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times’s report is inaccurate.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI examination of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or just – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump responsible?
If we watch those tests, there's a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slowaak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that lived in my ambassador house at a time.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me to set up Sabbath candles on that table that wears the swastika.
With that as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistics for Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers play Thursday hosts for Rapid Vienna, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive equity in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of Europe League.
A knee injuries prevented midfield player Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season to the 2-2-equity impact against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springing place for larger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the competition with the conviction that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Perhaps we could have won it at the end, but a equalization is probably a righteous outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game, because they had a good outcome in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I'm sure we can push and get a positive outcome.
Last year was certainly difficult, with all that happened to my injuries and the changes to the club, but now there is a good feeling factor in the place.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now persist, last season sit behind us and be successful."
Women Lose Sleep Over This Retirement Money Fear
Despite the fact that surveying participants have a clear idea of how to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half the individuals in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked about it with their children.
"People want a family member to care for them, but they do not take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance.
Here is true to begin.
Talk to your husband and the children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not express your wishes long beforehand.
Work with your advisor and your family to preach where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor in: Your advisor can also help you to come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your long-term financing decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insurance with your own abilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal disputes at the fit.
Get a health care staff instead so that you instruct a trusted person to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts meet your wishes if you cannot communicate.
Also consider the one who is responsible for your finances.
You should choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incompetent.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication and allergies?
Play those details in a written plan so that you are ready.
"It's not just the financial issues that are concerned, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place."
Man several times shot in Ilfracombe with windbucks
A man was shot several times with a windbow when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach, and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "equal act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life - threatening, and the police asked witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died because of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials said, and it is expected that the death count will rise.
With communication out of action, relief officers could not get any information from Donggala ruleship, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-range shaking.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were brought to safety after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central-Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379 800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit them.
Donggala is a rainship stretching along over 300 km (180 miles) coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regentship, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the support pillars of the Central-Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 a tsunami caused more than 200 deaths and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A Tsunami also hit West-Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the Zeismian Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A great shaking along the western coast of Indonesian Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, which led to a tsunami that struck 14 countries, led to 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shakings struck the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early April.
Hundreds died in Nias Island, along the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 - range hit the south of Java, Indonesia was most populated island, leading to a tsunami that struck the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 shaking struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-range shaking hit one of the Mentawai islands, near Sumatra, which led to a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozen villages and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level of shaking struck the Pidie Jaya rule in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shaking and tsunami in 2004.
It didn't lead to a tsunami this time, but more than 100 were killed because of buildings that collapsed.
2018: Great shakings hit Indonesia’s tourist island Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The shaking destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily buried.
Sarah Palin’s oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested under suspicion of household violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition to arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took off a female knowledge's phone to her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in detention at Mat-Su Pre-processing facility and is held on a $500 unscured deposit, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court Saturday, where he declared "innocent, decisive," when asked what he was pleading, the network reported.
Palin is faced with three classes of A-breds, which means he can be locked up to a year and $250,000 is paid.
He is also charged with a class of B-transgression, punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time criminal complaints against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently serving before Alaska’s Veteran Court.
In January 2016 he was accused of domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possessing a gun while drunk, in connection with the incident.
His girl claimed that he had boxed her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his military duty in Iraq.
Indonesian earthquake tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communication networks were out of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered together for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors are looking for rare death sentence for suspicion in NYC terreur attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are looking for the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that caused eight people's death – a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side highway in Laer Manhattan to reap pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed the eight victims and "deliberately" committed serious physical injuries, according to the notice of intention to ask for the death penalty, submitted in the Southern District of New York.
Both of those charges have possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal large jury struck Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder for the benefit of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a complaint of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "definite planning and pretense," said prosecutors, and described the way Saipov carried it out as "abhorous, cruel and perverse."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injured, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco caused."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has been over since then the Southern District of New York legally persecuted a death sentence.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced for the murder of two drug providers but was finally sentenced to life - long prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been killed after being sentenced for a plot to carry out spying for the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an Aborigin of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no repentance in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told detectors that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after looking at ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the police said.
He pleaded innocently on the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro Deo Advocates representing Saipov, said that they were "naturally disappointed" with the persecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than accept a debt recognition to life prison with no possible release will only extend the trauma of these events for all those involved." said Patton.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked persecutors not to desire the death penalty.
Tory LP says that NIGEL FARAGE should be controlled by Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize "the people's army" today during a protest at the Tory Conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel the "heat" of Eurosceptics – since one of Theresa May's own LPs suggested he should be in control of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that by the time the UK was "should be out" if Mr. Farage Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to unite her deeply distributed officers by suggesting pro-Romein Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister struggles to keep her Chequers compromise plan in the midst of Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU attacks.
Alliances insisted that she would press through in her attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the dead course – and Eurosceptics and Labour force to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Mr. Bone said to the Loop Betekent Loop-Congress in Solihull that he wanted to "push Chequers."
He suggested that Mr. Farage had to be made a noble man and was given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he had been in control, we would have been out by the time,' he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added, 'I'll stand up for Brexit, but we must erase Chequers.'
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 stemmery: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain is totally false.’
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: ‘ I simply say, First Minister, listen to the people.
‘ Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bombard the streets and make sure that we are chosen first.
Let Chequers please go and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she added: ‘First ministers must keep their work when keeping their promises.’
Mr. Farge told that the convention politicians had to feel the "heat" if they were on the threshold to wish to violate the decision taken in the 2016 reference.

The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting incident Friday and asked for help to identify a man who was seen in the image material.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton sounds world title after team commands gave him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday before Lewis Hamilton when Mercedes's team commands would play a major role in the races.
From stake position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fettel first entered the wells and left Hamilton to enter the bundle in traffic quite behind, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes broke a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward to wheel-on-wheel action that the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-free left the inside at risk of stopping to a double-motion to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen began from the back of the jumping schedule and was seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he held on his tyres to quickly finish and crossed Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the wells on the 44th round but could not accelerate his pace in the remaining eight rounds, since Raikkonen had taken fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day, because Valtteri did fantastic weekends and was a true sir.
The team performed extraordinary work to have one-two," said Hamilton.
It was a tremendous bad body language.
On Saturday at a convention, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein about her urge that she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford's letter in which his Supreme Court-generated Brett Kavanaugh accused of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a convention in West-Virginia and did not directly address the evidence given by Ford before the Senate Legal Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "common and unforgivable and liars".
"The one thing that can happen and the lovely thing that has gone into the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and liars," he said.
"When you look at explanations and leaks and then they say," o, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document--"o, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't lik it."
Well, wait a little.
He added, in a condition of the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that presented the accusations back in July against Kavanaugh by Ford, and it was earlier in September leck - but Feinstein denied that the leakage had come from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations. I didn't leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But the president did not consider her denial well and commented during Saturday evening's convention, "I tell you what. It was a tremendous bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court of Justice accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the commonness, the unfairness, they don't care who hurts them, who they have to circulate to get power and control," mediaite reported the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League’s loss against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 competition in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-purpose guidance by throwing from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team together before Dwyer restored the Giants’ direction.
Francois Bouchard brought Dundee together before two Luke Lundvald Nielsen goals tied their victory.
It was the third Elite League victory of the season for Adam Keefe’s men who first lost competitions and then won on Friday evening Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth convention of the season between the sides, with the Giants who won the previous three matches.
Dwyer's openball came at 3:35 in the fourth minute from a Kendall McFaull help, with David Rutherford who offered the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into play at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the supplier for Cownie’s equator at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants take direction until the first break in when he threw his second purpose of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again found them in parallel with a power game goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined in helping Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the competition in the second half and he made sure of the win with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants who have now lost four of their last five matches are home to Milton Keynes in their next Friday game.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of aeroplane can escape earthquake
An air traffic manager in Indonesia is considered to be a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane that carried hundreds of people had risen safely.
More than 800 people are dead and more are missing after a great earthquake on Friday hit the island of Sulawesi, and caused a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area, and many are trapped in breakdowns in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues who fled for their lives, however, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that swinged severely at the Mutiara SIS Al-Jupri airport in Palu.
He remained immovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was at the time at the runway, was able to rise safely.
He then jumped down from the traffic control tower when he day it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
Speaker for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported Australia’s ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, this morning we lost him before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts break to hear of this," he added.
In the meantime, authorities fear that the number of deaths can reach the thousands with the country’s disaster conspiracy agency, which says that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"There is believed that death still increases as many bodies are still under the pitfalls while many can still not be reached," said Agent Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Golds reaching up to six feet [6 m] plucked Palu, who would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute brings an ambulance in.
Clean water is scarce.
The minimarks are plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross chases to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it can become much worse."
Indonesia’s president Joko Widodo arrived in Palu Sunday and said to the country’s military service: "I ask you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane accident: Air Niugini says that one man is missing after sea lake aircraft accident
The airline that handled a flight that collapsed in a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says that one man was missing after they had previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not account for a male passer.
The airline said that they were working with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital Saturday, and that all of them were in a stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. fleet both said that the plane had landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane had come in very low.
"It's a special good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium - depth water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air guards had paniced and shouted and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. fleet said that shipowners who worked close to the improvement of a cab also helped with a blowable boat with the salvation to get people back and forth before the plane was sinking in about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Air Safety Network suggests that 111 people have died in the past two decades in collapse of PNG registered airlines, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analysts set out timeline from night that woman was burned alive
The state closed his case Saturday in the re-examination of a man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S.- Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analyses.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to gather the movements of 29-year-old charged Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night he died.
Rowlett said that he received location data from various mobile phones showing that Tellis together was Chambers the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's dress that night, Sanford said, "Jok, because my dress was in Nashville."
Another inconsistence is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Mobile records indicated that they knew each other only for a week.
Rowlett said that for a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers' messages, calls and contact information removed from his phone.
"He spared her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense was scheduled to start its final calls on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genres by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origin of political messages and the approach to social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent retrieval in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
NY-childfriend marry couples because she was dismissed after "rascist" text.
A New York boyfriend suggerated a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she received a wrong recipient message from the mother who complained that she was another black person.
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the contest with "expression."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her upset when she learned that the new child career, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEE TO A SWART PERSOON," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she twice sent it to me Maurice.
After she noticed her mistake, a "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed me Maurice and said that they were outgoing child girl who was African-American, doing bad work and that rather she expected a Philippine, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for her one day's work and then sent a Uber home.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damage compensation over the dismissal and seeks his damage compensation up to the amount of $350 a day for the six months, resident work for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do such things," she told the Post Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple struck back on the claims that they were racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s takeover and feared that they could not trust her after they insulted her.
"My wife sent her something that she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racsis.
We are not racist people," told man Joel Plasco the Post.
"But would you sit your children in the hands of someone with whom you were unforgivable, even though it was by abusive?
Your newborn baby?
Now."
Plasco compared the matter with "expression" and said that his wife would have had a baby in two months and had been in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you pursuing such a person?
It's not a very nice thing to do," added the investment banker.
While the case continued, the court of public opinion had been quick to bring the couple on social media and cut them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a speaking bear would not link readers.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read it for the first time before it was published.
It's very entertaining that we know about Paddington's great success."
She said that her father would have been fierce if his work had been rejected. He was a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication after his death was "bittersweet".
About Paddington, who she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was quietly proud of his final success.
"He was quite a silent man and he wasn't an apple shitty man," she said.
"But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if one had a child who had reached something: you are proud of them, even though it wasn't your work.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success in that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to greet the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was hunted to Nice’s Louis Pasteur 2-hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, that they didn't expect her to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, lady of heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors gave her to knock her heart was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing.
I just had to sit there waiting, knowing that this was folding.
I could not cheer or cry or cry, because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to assemble it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who at that time was hurt for the loss of her daughter, went along with the other passengers on board the plane--unconsciously appreciated the trial she went.
"Nobody knew," she said.
"I had my head down and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I got a overwhelming sympathetic feeling for Nad at the flight.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Mourning Women Post Cards to Prevent Suicide on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards for a while on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Me Davis’s son Tyler was 13 when he began to lead to depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I want no parent to feel as I feel every day," she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"Everybody knew him for his smile.
They always said that she smiled any room illuminated."
However, he gave up work before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, "I am constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Me Davis designed the cards, "to let people know that there are people out there to whom you can go and to whom you can talk, even though it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence--you should talk."
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her husband of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he felt sick or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas day--when the children opened their gifts, he did not make eye contact or something with them."
She said his death was very traumatic to them, but that they had to work through it: "It rip a hole through the family.
It breaks us apart.
But we must all go on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is still uncertain as FBI investigation began
"I thought if we could actually get something as he asked for - a timeless investigation that had no cover - we could bring a little unity," said Mr Flake Saturday and added that he feared that the committee was "flying apart" under the scattered partisan accumulation.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to investigate the FBI?
Their reluctance is all because of time calculation.
The interchange elections are gone only weeks, on November 6, - if, as expected, the Republicans are bad, then they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the man whom they prefer to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush calls senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who by him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI delivered his report?
There will be a Voice in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It's not clear if Mr. Kavanaugh can come up to at least 50 votes on the senate floor that Mike Pence, the vice president, will allow to break an equation and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea overflower numbers 'dalk' under Kim
The number of North Korean overlopers to South Korea has declined since Kim Young-un came to power seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug quoted data from the South's unification cabin and said that last year there were 1,127 overlaps - compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that stricter border control between North Korea and Shina and higher rates demanded by human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
The large majority of overlopers from the North are finally offered South Korea civil rights.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have been illegally crossing the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most flight through Shina, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to walk over than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
Shina considers the overlappers to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them with violence.
Relations between the North and the South who are still technically in war with each other - has significantly improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries in Pyongyang had met for conversations centered around the rising negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
It came to the historical meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs Ri Yong-ho has blamed US sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," said Mr. Ri in a talk to the UN General Meeting in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histeries", says he is inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court
Home minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court-genominated Brett Kavanaugh "histeries" and said that he was temperamentally inappropriate to serve at the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help to think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would say 'histeries'," said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate-right committee Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied emotional accusations that he had sexually attacked Dr Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening declaration, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times almost shouted and stirred while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly rejected democrats on the committee and called the claims against him a "coordinated and coordinated charity murder", organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh’s evidence proved that he could not serve at the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think he makes himself inadequate with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to complain to Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats win the majority in the Lower House.
"I'll say it -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not competent to be at the Supreme Court, but to be at court on which he is currently," said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that she as a democrat was worried about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Law on Cheap Care or Roe v. Wade since he is considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced person to go to court and expect us to say, 'it's not wonderful,' said Pelosi.
And women have to handle it.
It's a righteous diatribe, months and years' anger that boils, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was very helped by a woman who was an executive officer somewhere, who also said she was crying when she had become angry, but a technique had developed that meant that when she had become angry and began to cry, she would have said to the person with whom she had spoken, "You may think that I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
And I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for magic because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early work in a male-dominated office is where I once found that I was crying with nameless anger and grabbed at my neck by an older woman--a cold manager to whom I was a little afraid--who dragged me in a t reportal.
"Don't let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know that you're angry.
They think you're sad and will be happy because they have affected you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Kolorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught out in an out-marital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, me Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she couldn't investigate the idea that she could run for president.
"I didn't think well about the decision," she said to me laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snewy and the Seven Dwergies."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with find collections and so she vowed that she would not enter the races unless she had collected $2 million.
It was a lost struggle.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 would give her only $250.
"Think they I get off?" she wondered.
When she gave her talk and announced that she would not lead a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions--grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to target choosers rather than delegate, and angry with the sexism--that she struck.
You would have thought I had a nervous collapse," recalled me Schroeder about how the press had responded to her.
"You would have thought that Kleenex was my corporative borg.
I remember thinking, what are they going to sit on my tombstone?
"She cried?"
How the US-China trade war might be good for Beijing.
The opening salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and Shina was over-deafening and while the battle is far away, a dispute between the countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long term, say experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most interesting escalation has rolled in this week with new rates that affect $200 trillion ($150 trillion)’s items and effectively charged half of the goods coming into the U.S. from Shina.
Beijing returned in goods every time, and recently, tariffs from five to ten percent hit $60 trillion U.S. goods.
Shina promised to equate the US lap-for-lap and the world's largest economy will not move soon.
Getting Washington to stand back means surrender to requests, but publicly meeting the US's requests will be too embarrassed for Xi Jinping, Shina's president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards correctly, pressure over US trade war over the long - term Sjina can support positively by lowering the interdependency of the two economies.
The fact that a rapid police decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic toll flight in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed," said Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia in the middle of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria 'reed' for refugees to return, says Minister of Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for the volunteer return of refugees, and calls for help to rebuild the land destroyed by war for more than seven years.
Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground level is more stable and secure due to progress in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrian people have fled the country since then the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need phylantropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the flat land.
However, he emphasized that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe conquers Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 rider cup and Span conquered US with a final point of 16.5 by 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a rider cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe returned the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team took the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled for most of the tournament, had his T-hou in the water at the par-3 16th hole and gave his competition to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari has blinked in all its rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players ever going 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format started in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olees of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Pulter from England who might have played in his final rider cup.
A veteran of eight rider cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It was a rough year.
So grateful for Thomas who chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so glad to get the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory
He hands the torch over to his countrymate John Ram who won US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel, to conquer Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that very old," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four his competitions in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career rider-beker record.
A strange statistics by one of the largest players of all times and he won 14 major titles second to Jack Nicklaus.
Span U.S.A. struggled all weekend to find the cleaning field with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance on behalf of his team: "I am proud of these guys. They fought.
There was time this morning when we sat a little heat on Europe.
We deleted.
Hate off for Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
All 12 his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 boys, and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You need to keep your hat tight.
We're exaggerated."
