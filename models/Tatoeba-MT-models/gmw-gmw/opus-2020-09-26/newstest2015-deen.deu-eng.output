Police of Karratha arrested 20-year-olds after faster motorcycle hunting
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver had driven it by 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Transport policemen in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it as it left a petrol station on the Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
The police reported that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued on the Burgess Road before buoying into the Buschland where the officials lost it from the eyes.
The motorcycle as well as a person corresponding to the driver's description were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
The police of Karratha accuses a 20-year-old man of non-respondering a stop signal as well as a thoughtless drive.
He shall appear in the office court in Karratha on 23 September.
The motorcycle was secured and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is at court because of the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
The accusation is that Webster attacked her while she was "sustainless, sleeping, and could not signal any consent."
In addition, Webster is accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim on 4 May 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the date of negotiation for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Reconciliation to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congress members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a legislative proposal to establish the organisation of trade unions as civil law.
"As trade unions die, the middle class jobs also die," said Ellison, a democrat from Minnesota and deputy president of the Progressive Cucus congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the Employees Authorisation Act together with the Civil Rights icon John Lewis.
This breaching law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination about the organisation of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and stops forces so anti-employed.
The addition of the National Labour Law to create a way of discriminating workers to organize a trade union representation to complain to a civil court for justice - and to obtain compensation for damage or penalties - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it certainly is not a radical initiative - at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their legislation, is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the reverses that trade unions have been exposed in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognise, extend and respect labour rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans remembered when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in a breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militaryized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
In full consciousness that the workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to association and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after the Second World War, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Fascism Adolf Hitler would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause expressly saying: "The right to establish associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to each individual and every profession or business.
Agreements which restrict this law or aim to weaken it are null and void; measures aiming at it are illegal.
When the former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt held the presidency of the International Human Rights Commission, designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everybody has the right to form trade unions to protect or join them."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premises that labour rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to establish a trade union - and that this trade union should then be protected in collective negotiations as an equivalent partner with companies and government bodies.
After these rights came under rising in America, it is really very wise to reconsider the American ideal, so the working population must have the right to unite and listen in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now all know that the workers' movement did not restrict the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By increasing the living standards of millions of people, work has created a marvelous market for industry and increased the entire nation to unimaginable production levels.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but the history preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do that too.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as a protection against discrimination in the creation of representatives of workers - has long been overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that America has raised in the past and solved the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporarily law that all abortion clinics in Louisiana could force to close
On Sunday, a U.S. federal judge suspended the implementation of a law in Louisiana, saying that it would probably have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics of the state.
This measure, which was imposed by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana in June and was to enter into force on September 1st, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a hospital's hospital's right of hospitals within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practice.
However, the judgeâ€™s decision means that doctors may continue to perform legal abortions provisionally while applying for such a law.
"The applicants can continue to comply with law as they strive to achieve these rights," wrote Bundesrichter John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be made for the judge to make a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, which was most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures and said that doctors had made more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana miss a deterrent law that wants to take them their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and Chairman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, who had complained on behalf of three of the five clinics of the State to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the complaint and also applied for instruction rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states who have adopted similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures in Alabama and Mississippi not constitutionally.
Key places of a law in Texas, which would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close, were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists as well as the American Medical Association agree that the rights of doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Advocates opposed that the measures serve to protect the health of women, although some also welcomed the effects of closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who runs abortions in Louisiana has patient instinct rights, informed the Center for Reproduction Rights.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop taking abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation because of fear of his safety, the group said.
In their arguments against the judgment, representatives of the State Louisiana said that they would not punish doctors for the implementation of abortions, while their requests for patient instincts would still be pending.
Delayed diagnostics and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates due to ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have put a video homeage online for their mother who died of egg cancer in 2007.
For women in the rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying of ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analysed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, who found eggstock cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research manager Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
CLEAN STUDY: New medicines may slow pulmonary and ovarian cancers
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, existing diseases, as well as the social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer has been further advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city died of ovarian cancer with a higher probability, Dr. Jordan suspects late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are usually found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services to prevent distances, it suggested, as possible, that the service of fledged doctors be strengthened in order to give specialists the opportunity to provide women more densely in their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographic status, showed a poor long-term survival rate in women in egg cancer and underlined the need for better treatment and precautionary strategies.
The study financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years, learned from the gold coast that she had an aggressive form of oarstock cancer.
Garden centres regret sinking house owner numbers
The decline along with an increased reduction in the number of household owners under 35 years could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year when today's young consumers, according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times, reach the "Cernal Age Group for Garden Products".
The report states that tenants spend on an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with their homes spend on their gardens.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of asphalting gardens for park purposes and the sinking garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which estimated Â£5 billion are implemented annually in sale.
In London, where over a period of 6 years the share of homeowners has dropped from 61 to 43 percent, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that living for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Garden Adviser for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "Golden Age" of garden retail trade due to increasing household ownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also forecasted a improved market situation for this year because of the better weather due to unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the clergyman Tahirul Qadri in Pakistan continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1000 demonstrators stormed the state television station PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said that soldiers could have pushed the protesters again from PTV buildings.
The transmitter launched its operation for about 40 minutes, but now sends it again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Around a mile away, they supplied with sticks and stones equipped collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The demonstrators demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refused it.
As a result, the army of the country urges a political solution to the conflict "to waste without time and apply without violence".
After a meeting in the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military informed: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been placing more often.
The opposition politician Imran Khan proposes Prime Minister Sharif to have deceived during the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests were escalated on the weekend after Khan and Qadri had called their followers to penetrate Sharif's residence.
Three people had been killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat due to spionage reports
The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the former US diplomats of the country for information on a report on American and British spionage in Turkey.
Vice Prime Minister Bulent said that the U.S. Embassy's businessman and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German Magazine The Spiegel as well as the online magazine The Intercept reported that those of the former US analysts of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and British secret services.
According to Turkish news agencies, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan played down the importance of the report and said that all important countries were pioneering each other.
An earlier report that also had Germany's most important secret service in the visa ensured that the Turkish government reacted significantly angry.
Warning strike: Locator threatens with consequences for pendlers
The Federal Warning Trail of the LokfÃ¼hrer on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
All transport companies, including remote, regional and S-Bahn transport, were announced for 18 to 21 o'clock.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.

The district chairman of the German Lokomotive Guide (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in DÃ¼sseldorf, said.
We expect significant failures.
Regional priorities do not exist.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight transport.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced to do everything to keep the effects as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to see the consequences specificly.
Police chief of Magaluf accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca evidence of pressures by policemen and employees of the city of CalviÃ .
The chief of the police from CalviÃ  on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption claims by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous Binge-Drinking-Hotspot Magaluf.
Following corruption, Commissioner JosÃ© Antonio Navarro was arrested by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street in which most bars and nightclubs of Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of pressures by police officers and employees of the city of CalviÃ  to the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption claims and are asked by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry night club owners claimed that the veteran economy of the authorities has serious effects on their businesses.
"It's no longer about earning money, it's about survival," said one of the businessmen to the court.
Leave our basis of life out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
This summer Magaluf made international headlines for a viral YouTube video, showing an 18-year-old British tourist who performed 24 men during a surgery Fellatio.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the irregular behaviour of alcoholized holidayers in Magaluf by minimising the number of participants in the infamously alcoholized chicken tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Kneipentour Organizer Carnage have to pay a penalty of â‚¬55,000 (â‚¬73.000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under alcohol influence, including the trend of "Balconing", where people jump from one balcony to the other or from one balcony to the hotel pool.
The first Spring Day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide Airport
The FRUHLING has given South Australia a winter surprise, with intense spectacles and strong winds that affected flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21 o'clock, another 5mm rain fell to the city after 6.6mm, which had already dropped down on Sunday at night.
The last precipitation was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a shot that started shortly before 20 a.m. and provided almost 4mm rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week provided for an early dose of spring, the temperatures in the city reappeared to a maximum of only 15.8Â°C on Monday.
The boring weather conditions have probably led to the late landing of a flight from Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 19.30 p.m., however, was hit by a screwwind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
At this time, wind turrets reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport.
The flight data showed that the plane had to continue on a second landing flight and finally set up at about 20.40 p.m.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of some other flights, including a Emirate flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum temperature of 16Â°C was predicted for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible shimmers.
Matthies says: Maximum time for big networking
In view of the galopping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech board centres, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts with a highly familiar electronic accessories.
While I'm writing this here, my eyes fall on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a reason for this: if the cable wasn't, all the listeners would fly around in the house in the shortest time, and that would be significant more retro.
In any case, does it apply to the eceltronic (ekeltronic?
No, tip error: electronic) sector purchased the rule that the world novelty of today is the electroshoot of tomorrow - obsolete.
And for example, whoever still has a tube TV in the living room today, simply says that he refuses television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the penetration of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again leads us to our absolute incompetence in electronics issues.
The laie, who used to be blindly mastered washing machine and CD players, does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are spread before him with incomprehensible oaths of experts: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us by the press.
Yeah, you all right?
What should be discussed with people who appear to spread such quark voluntarily?
In fact, for some 20 years, it has been most important for us to network our house.
So that the yoghurt will re-order itself so that the fire detector tells us during the vacation on the Maldives that it is just burning in the work room.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we were from the office from the air conditioning on our soon arrival ...?
Yes, however, that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our bracelet watch, say you loudly "saugs!" - and at home the dust saucer rides off.
Irre.
Everything goes beyond nothing but a revolution: "The borders between white and brown goods are blurred," raunts a industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam-garer sends the weather report and the data glass shows how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but this does not help because we are in the stew.
We also know from daily practice: When a new-modical device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What is another reason for the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after they had spent the summer in air reserves, while rockets and mortars were shot on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools remained closed in Gaza while the area recovered from the battles.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities drawn by rocket holes in the south of Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern town of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, were removed from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, resident in the Kibbutz Seed and there English teacher.
Many children from our area urgently need the return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little funny" to go back to school suddenly.
"They were difficult times, and we haven't gone out of the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until the war stopped last week, thousands of residents of the border communities, such as seed, remained in their houses or left their houses to move further away from Gaza in safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a municipality near the Gaza border, in which a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar granate still hesitates to return.
The Ministry of Education noted that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Her children were temporarily housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanjahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town in Gaza, which is hardly marked by the Palestinian fire.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said: "We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed last Tuesday to an indefinite ceasefire.
The rest of the weapons ensured an immediate end of the fight; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand after the Israeli-Egypt blockade of Gaza and the reopening of the airports in Gaza.
Israel demands a disarmament of Hamas and the handling of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed at the battles.
A new round of indirect discussions is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, estimated by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel objects to such information and estimates that at least half of the killers are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai workers, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar granates during the fights on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
At the same time, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza region and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools, which were converted into provisional protection areas.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the protective areas and continue fighting, the education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school is open soon again so we can continue to learn, as the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
By choice in Saxony: CDU-Vize Strobl challenges NPD prohibition procedures
Due to the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl expressed itself in favour of an end to the current NPD prohibition procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition procedures against the NPD should be terminated before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD cuts down worse than the last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU-Landschef in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a delightful development in the right direction and a development that makes me more able to achieve the political fight against the NPD rather than before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed at the vote on Sunday very little at the five- percent hurdle.
A first call for a prohibition of the extreme legal party failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection had also been in the NPD spits of informants at that time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new request in Karlsruhe after long preparation.
Federal government and Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for New Refugees
Refugees are now housed in tents at the New Zealand Square.
The Central First Recording for Refugees in Harburg bursts from all the seams.
Now the interior authority has placed three tents of the Red Cross next to it.
The district politicians were notified shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to prevent citizens and give the district politicians no opportunity to contribute constructively to the human housing of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, Group Chairman of the Greens at the Harburg District Assembly.
Its party demands that the district administration of Harburg currently provide unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be housed in the three tents.
Reasons for the overfill in the initial record are the storm of aid seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore remain longer than the regular three months.
The house prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, shows a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, according to the Monday RP data.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice as high as the rise in the 12 months until August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
The research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, informed that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-parted market.
The figures of RP Data show that the house prices in Sydney increased by 16.1 percent last year, while in Melbourne by 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices averaged by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale, Canberra, which was severely affected by the cuts in public expenditure and where prices increased by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless continued that, at the beginning of the spring, there would now be an increase in the real estate for sale, which would be "a real test" on the market.
"When one considers the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that the home prices will continue to rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In an opinion to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of Managing Director Peer Medau and testes this to pose "like a governor".
This is not the style of the university, says the Communication.
Thus, the Medau family had already been informed "on the middle of June orally about the inquiry of the university.
The statement that the plans became known only in July is definitely wrong," says PÃ¶tzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "declarations or even decisions" but "preferencies".
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
A nine-metre-width road was and is not the case.
It goes after current stand by 5.50 meters, that's one metre broader than before," PÃ¶tzl explains.
The argument of Medau operators that their free and school-based parking spaces will only be used by university students in the future does not want PÃ¶tzl to apply.
Zugeparkt will not be at all because, as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Think of the residents
The children's cripple of mountain weights, which is on the ground and which would lead the entrance to the park deck in front of their door, is to be "not affected" according to the university president.
Rather, he considers "that this is not only about the children's cripple, but also about the residents at the interference to the Friedrich Strib Street and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
So it's much more than particular interests of Mr Medau," says PÃ¶tzl.
Whether the criticism of the parental council of the children's cripple, with the expansion of the street, would have been entitled to lose a "the few naturally left spots of Coburg" "the reader can decide himself".
At the beginning of October PÃ¶tzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 and address the importance of the new development in this context.
Peer Medau had informed the children's parents last week about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access to the new park deck is not to lead through the campus and the Friedrich-Streik-StraÃŸe, but through the Medau-Berg.
This means that the narrow road would have to be expanded two-spurely on about a mile long.
According to Medaus's accounts, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would thus become tenfold.
There are about 2000 vehicles daily.
From the sides of the city, they have not wanted to express themselves to the project.
Glandorf comes back from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old of the Bundesligist SG Flensburg-Handewitt led in particular health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured for several months.
It is time for me to listen to the signals of my body and to end my career in the national team," the 2007 World Master informed on his Facebook page.
It thus goes with a balance sheet of 167 country games and 576 gates for Germany in international retirement.
Because the wrestling backroom player for the Champions-League winner from Flensburg still wants to go on Torejagd for a few years, he is no longer available to the new German trainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announced its framework for the country games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf led a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have enthusiasmd me as they will also enthusiasm my long-standing fellow players and my followers.
But for my club, I would like to be healthy in the next few years, for this longer regeneration breaks are needed, which do not allow the current double load.
The left hand had to fear his career end after a heel infection in 2012.
Due to achill cinema problems, he had been treated with a cortison syringe by team doctors of the German Handball Association (DHB), which later caused a strong inflammation.
One emergency operation and two further interventions followed.
Then Glandorf announced a complaint against the team doctor, the conflict ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professionals and eleven years of national team career do not pass any body without a squeeze.
I have some health buildings that I can't ignore anymore.
After the three infection-related foot surgery that took place in short distances in 2012, I never got my blood pressure properly controlled.
There are some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I noticed that although I control my head, I can't deceive my body," Glandorf explained in the interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in the absolute emergency.
"When all the strings rip, I'm always ready to talk," said the two-fold family father to the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humiliated about my health.
After my career, at least I want to go straight.
He won the EFF pocal in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European population of the Pocal victors with Flensburg.
German economy decreased by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe have inhibited the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product decreased by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This informed the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed provisional calculations.
In spring alone, the economy was experiencing, while investments fell.
The external trade also inhibited the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual turnover, a total GDP percentage of 0.8 percent for the first half of the year is achieved compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the goal of the "MÃ¼nsterland-Mooiste", which led the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmann City of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "fiet drivers" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "MÃ¼nsterlande-Mooiste".
It covers the largest bike tour across the MÃ¼nsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1,000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for the organization of this tour through the MÃ¼nsterland.
These tour interested parties were offered in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and have traveled overnight to take part in this tour.
We want to get to know the MÃ¼nsterland once more in this way," the cyclists welcomed the route through the circles Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the Vereinsheim der SchÃ¼tzenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where the start took place.
The route, which was written for three different categories, led back to Horstmar in the direction of the SchÃ¶pinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Bilderbeck.
On 95 kilometres of 1175 meters of height, 120 kilometres of 1475 meters and 145 meters of 1775 meters, cyclists proved their good condition.
They were nursed on the way in Havixbeck and Bildbeck.
Chief organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayor deputy Heinz LÃ¶lfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for all involved.
The organization remained without problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz LÃ¶lfing draws a positive conclusion to this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see again in 2015 with hopefully beautiful weather on August 30, or during another weekend," however, cyclists promised to return to MÃ¼nsterland again and organizers plan a new edition.
Constantin Weckers unfairly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Constantin Wecker, Songmaker, Pacifist, politically secure activist, ex-Happling, in "MÃ¶nch und Krieger" has brought to the paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thoughts for thoughts, the Municher born on 1 June 1947 wrote his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is unfairly honest: From Onanie as a gymnasian to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow humans.
Wide space also takes abstract, but more important terms: Love, soul, ego, Being in Now, Spirituality - all that he tries to go on the ground in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how not only the music has influenced him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the Lebemann Konstantin Wecker closer to the Ascetic monk, which "crees through subtraction", as he says, "by leaving everything necessary".
But there are also short anecdotes to the earth between all the highly spiritual views: for example about battering in a place frequented by GIs or a mad drive where he visited a tree frontally.
He's unfairly honest too.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in the arm.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a family of Japanese immigrants in Dudley in Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and her relationship was limited.
Henry testes for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of Reggae and Rap, with vibrant melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He visited "many" therapies after the death of his mother, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
They never saw his face, just stopped his voice: "Have stopped with the collapse.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown when I was a child - went with him into the chicken and talked about things such as the form of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beating.
I never had such a conversation with him.
Most of my life he was this serious guy in the corner of the newspaper.
Recently Henry opened a molding in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father's time, he won an insight into how life might have been for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep rising labyrinth with flames and smoke and much rust.
My father used to simply lay in the waist and then he was slowly heard as he started singing because he could wash the molding from himself.
When I ran around there, I realized that he had done this for years to bring the food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' testimonies of love.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
Only when my mother was bad at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop embraceing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French, with whom he was married 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's hard.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry's change of career may be shown in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he was joined by the theater.
It followed the comedy of the mistakes, and then the fences of August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the Sitcoms and Comodies who have filled out his busy working life.
He started at only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the stage when he imitated people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His television career began in the middle of the seventies. "I was the only black imitator/Comedian on television for a very long time."
He learned in the profession.
I had to grow up not only in the eyes of the public, but also learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient jokes story machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had the right of stage at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which the people were "black painted," Henry launched his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unpleasant.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years of award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "great parodie of black people."
By the introduction of figures that both mocked and celebrated the British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went on mission in 1984, and in the nineties he was known among other things as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the Comedy Series Chief!.
Advertising, documentary films, TV series, and film roles were characterizing his next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought: "What are you doing next, Len, because it feels everything as if you're just bringing the time around or stepping up a little."
Afterwards a documentary for Radio 4 with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was quite allergic.
I had never learned something really about him at school and thought him predominantly for a domain of the middle class, white in strumpfhoses and a cabbage head in front of him.
So I was very scared of that.
All of us interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't be bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take some of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary film and he was enthusiastic.
I felt I could do that.
It was almost like someone finally put up my head right.
"There's this, it's a serious thing, take them seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The samples were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
Soon he appeared in the comedy of the errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry felt instinctively that he had to talk to the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to bridge 10 minutes now while they repair the computer."
Instead, the director announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went from the stage and said something in me, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences am Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for fences was demanding.
Panic is very good, that strengthens the tendons.
This too came well, so it's like a big sign of the gods who tell me "This is your destination."
He says this, of course, with a DONNERD voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a sample room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is through humorous outbreaks, while he always imitates people.
I have decided not to make a stand-up comedy because I think this type of immediate satisfaction is somehow dangerous by a room full of strangers.
If you're always looking for this, you'll drive it in front of a wall.
I sometimes get live in the Apollo when I want to do this, but in total there is not as much as I did before.
I'm asking him if he's ever going to take a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps to form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a trip - I don't think I ever want to give up.
So is this his new incarnation here?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block streets in Jemen's capital
In the conflict between Shitic Huthi rebels and the Jemenite government, the Huthis called for civil disobedience in the capital of Sanaa.
Huthi trailers had occupied central streets in Sadah on Monday, said a speaker of the Huthi party "Ansar Allah".
Parliament's access has also been blocked.
Yemeni media report about a chaos of traffic in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Huthi threatened, according to the sheet, with a further escalation of the conflict, its demands should not be met.
The Shitic Huthis struggled for more independence from the Sunny ruled Yemen and demanded the resignation of the government.
For nearly two weeks, the Huthi people's tribe has besieged the Jemenite capital.
Approximately 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the large roadways of Sanaa.
In the surroundings, bloody fighting with the Jemenite army is repeatedly on the ground.
Kenya registered officials to inhibit "Geisterarbeiter"
Kenya has begun to register all government officials biometrically to remove "host employed" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, was a government communication.
The government suspects that thousands of people will receive salaries even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in public service in 2013.
At an examination at the beginning of this year, it was found that at least 1 million dollars (700.000 Â£) per month were lost in payments for "ghost employed" and other misuse financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person died or leaves public service, reports Wanyama Chebusiri for the BBC from Nairobi capital.
All officials must now appear at identification centres in the next two weeks in order to ensure that their data is recorded on biometric registrations, has been notified in a government message.
All those who did this not without a credible apology would be removed from the salary list were further stated in the Communication.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalisation of the public service by identifying the actual number of officials and adjusting the salary list at both government levels - so the "priest employees" are eliminated," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralisation and Planning.
The scandal around the art advisor Helge Achenbach will be negotiated for the first time in court on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of the Aldi-GrÃ¼nder Theo Albrecht, demand damage from Achenbach and two of his companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil process at the DÃ¼sseldorf Landgericht.
It told a court speaker on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach deceived the purchase of works of art and old-timers and calculated Berthold Albrecht higher purchase prices than actually paid.
This would also give rise to the agreed commission.
Achenbach purchased value items for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
44 years in school, of which 23 were heads of school.
From this time Manfred Judges know many standing Petershausener and Collbacher from their time as a pupil.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always wore by his striving to see the people in the pupil.
The snowhead is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his home.
Judge was born in 1930 in Trautenau/Nordbohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was interested in the teacher's career after four years.
One year after that, the Sudeten Germans were engaged.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight cargon.
So it slipped Judge into the oberfranchic Senkendorf.
Teaching took place in Bamberg.
Manfred judge had to run ten kilometres per week to the nearest train station, drive to Bamberg, go three kilometres across the entire city to school and return to the evening.
After two months, Manfred Judge got a sleeping place in a red creuz home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 students in a sleeping room.
In 1951, he was the first and three years later.
Since he had no free teachers for Oberfranken, he applied to Oberbayern and came to the school in Kollbach on November 1, 1954.
The "FrÃ¤ulein-Zimmer" was his first "Servicewohnung" in the school house.
In 1958 he attended a three-room apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Judge in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach School Association and five in Petershausen.
From the 1968/69 school year these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a return in the now smaller school, the then president Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Judge became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, so the children and their teachers were able to gain today's construction, which was extended in 1997 according to Judge's retirement.
Manfred Judge praised the uncomplicated generousness of the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz, who, at municipal costs, also built a work space and at the 1997 extension of cellar rooms, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
"Burgermeister GÃ¶tz was very school-friendly," judge remembered gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred judge never forgot the speech of a government representative who had answered to a board of schools on justice and justice: "You should never forget love." Manfred judges put what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn: "It's not always possible." Whether he's just talking about his pupils or his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Judge's doing was sometimes unconventional.
When pupils beat themselves, they did not get a criminal labor from him, nor were they drowned for the aftermath.
At the expense of the municipality, judges had two pair of box gloves created and made the two counterparts stand against each other, even if there should be a veil.
To the benefit of the school, judges used a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig GÃ¶tz (CSU).
This moved the partyless judge after his retirement to compete at least as the last on the CSU list for the municipal council in 1996.
But Judge was preselected at place six and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 bicycle riders in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Scotland intermediate stops
If cyclists make their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scotland's rest, that's nothing special in themselves.
On Friday, however, the number of racings was solely impressed: The 700 participants of the hr4-radtour and accompaniedtross enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the Schottener Alteburg Park.
Under the motto "Radling and celebrating on newly discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday, and a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists attacked the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scotland.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started in Bad Vilbel by bike, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-DÃ¶ring.
For the refreshment of body and spirit, all kinds of good things have been prepared: the landwives from Ranstadt and Lower-Mockstadt had 85 sheets of apple, dwarf, scatter and cheese, which marvelously munded the skillful cyclists.
"These cakes can only bake landwives," praised one participant from Aulendiebach while ordering another piece.
At the beverage stand of the GeiÃŸ-Nidda tournament, cold refreshments were obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" interviewed the visitors with famous melodys from operettes and musicals and harvested enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
Moreover, a man liked a head massage of his partner: "He deserves it, finally he has already re-engined cycling chains again today."
As the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking curtain by Reporter Rainer Janke and took advantage of the opportunity to advertise in the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
As a tour manager since the first hr4 race tour in 2004, the chief Tobias Hagen was also able to take a short tour, but he had abundantly to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he wrote Facebook entries and made reportages using three phones and a radio device with his employees and the 15-body motorcycle rod of the police Hessen, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants originate from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from casting or fulda, from Lauterbach or Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia cyclists are travelled.
The number of participants is a bit based on the available overnight capacity.
In Category I, the participants are housed in hotels, in category II in collecting accommodations.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up after one and a half hours: "But!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they winged to the finish.
After arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were required in the idyllic Alteburg park.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft fÃ¼r Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festivity and, of course, it had been prepared for taverns, such as flames with well-cooled feather whites.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus HaÃŸfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his role as board member of ADAC Hessen-ThÃ¼ringen, welcomed the visitors.
The three were evidently delighted by the "much operation in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
Despite the sporting activity on the bicycle, the opportunity to swiftly move under the open sky was eagerly used.
Among the guests, increasingly blended citizens, who were just as provoked by the good mood as the great crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, for cyclists, the stations Birstein, WÃ¤chtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trent Forests - were on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Twenty Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey because of the suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies report.
The police authorities did not comment directly.
Among the arrested are 14 high-level policemen, reports HÃ¼rriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government staff, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested because they allegedly founded an organised criminal association and picked up telephone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then Prime Minister) described her action as part of the activities which are led by the Islamist clergyman Fethulla GÃ¼llen against him and other persons in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday, September 1, after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told journalists that not all schools had opened up again, but he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not everywhere over Ukraine peaceful.
We have to fight for a peaceful heaven.
All Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school director of the school in Slawjansk, the Jazenjuks daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace again and that the children will receive a education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC might have found the great director she needs.
It meets with a proud glorious loop from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with Bain and Co., a global management consultancy company, which changed to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and retired when the top post of the parent company Pearsons went to a younger male colleague.
Their deduction was supposed to be nearly 1 million Â£.
Her political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when he searched for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became a consultant of the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
I already described the Chairman's task with a poisoned cup in May.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Confidence works in two directions: after the inside on the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things run wrong.
This ensures an almost unsustainable duopol that demands a complete comprehensive reform.
But which newly arrived chairman would risk taking up everything and breaking up an institution that is as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while he might kill himself his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if it weren't enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC reduced - power, money and status obsolete.
As the competition approaches and threatens new technologies to old, comfortable security, the upcoming negotiation of the license fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of Â£ 145.50 a year, the British public buys itself into the most certainly largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: she says she reaches 96 percent of all households and costs only 40 pence per day.
And apparently, the BBC rises up again on the popular scale: 53 percent support today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and utilization habits for the BBC have changed: I'm getting news stamps on my mobile phone today and see missing programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and remarkable institution.
She needs a great chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that decreasing Tweet was not authorized
A Tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, contained on Sunday a deteriorating comment on the democratic district prosecutor who is at the heart of a criminal offence against him for abuse of authority.
The Tweet was later deleted and replaced by another by Perry's user account that dismisses the previous one.
Just a Tweet has been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't afford the Tweet and have deleted it," said the later message.
Employees of Perry did not respond promptly to requests for comments.
Although the Tweets of Perry's official user account went out, it was not clear who actually used the feed.
In the former Tweet, an unfavorable image of the district prosecutor of Travis County, Rosemary Lehmberg, was drawn, which was sentenced in April 2013 for drunkenness on tax.
Perry invoked a veto against a financial promotion of her office when she refused to resign, which led to a charge against Perry - which might be presidential candidate in 2016 - before a Grand Jury in Austin this month.
The text of the Tweet is: "I don't always drive drunk with the three-fold permissible alcohol level... but if I do, I'm accusing governor Perry when he pours it out."
I'm the drunkest democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the leadership of the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was run by Michael McCrum, a prosecutor from San Antonio, who was elected by a Republican judge.
Perry claims not guilty and called the charge a political trick.
His high-class team of legal assistance requested the court responsible for the case to reject the charge and argued that the law, with which the service-old governor in the history of the state of Texas is irrespectively diffus.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of government funds to the State's Public Integrity Unit, which is located in Travis County, in cases of state corruption in Texas, when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto provided a public complaint from a left-hand Watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is often updated - and sometimes famous.
After closing the elections in Iowa during his presidential candidate for 2012, Perry entered speculations that he would stop by posting a Tweet of a photo of himself near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we come!"
Berkeley explains housing market again for "normal"
One of London's most prominent builders pointed out that the housing market in the southeast of England was "return to the normal level".
Homes in the capital were very desirable and the subject of enormous price increases, which caused the Bank of England to set ceilings for mortgage credits in June due to the widespread fear of a loan bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak in 2013," adding that this offers a "stabil operating environment".
The real estate market in London was well established during the demolition, as foreign buyers drove into the capital.
According to the cataster office, prices in the city area alone increased by 18.5 percent last year, much more than the average increase in England and Wales in total.
The average sales prices for Berkeley's private, price-value and student offers rose by about one fifth last year and was around Â£ 423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive for foreign buyers in recent months â€“ some of them have also been shaken by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetorics for a possible "fowl tax" before the general elections in the next May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, in which stronger loan arrangements were presented, would also lead to lower market growth in the second half of the year in both real estate sales and prices.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday show a decline in the mortgage authorisation in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling off.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for the increase in real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 percent, based on a already weakening house price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by a quarter year by year, according to the Makler WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital for Berkeley is a blessing, as the due amounts for deadline sales amount to more than Â£2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-scheduled product at the best locations remained stable and, as a result, the deadline sales remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - almost a third more than the highest level 2007 before the crisis.
The annual pre-tax result rose by 40 percent to Â£280 million per year, turnover by 18 percent to Â£1.6 billion.
In a communication on Monday before the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that the revenue for Berkeley was expected to meet current market expectations during the current year.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result at Â£450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at Â£23.96 in London's trade in the afternoon.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence by hacker published on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscar ceremony.
Nackfotos of Oscar prize winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a "Master List" of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tributes of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and charged the hacker for "eklatanized violation of privacy".
The authorities were notified and will follow all those who continue posting the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing page 4chan were supposed to be obtained by a gap in the online storage system iCloud from Apple. The so-called "Master List" of Hacking Victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, reported BuzzFeed.
It is not sure how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, Star from "Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I have taken up in the private environment of our home years ago - I hope you are so well satisfied with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" disagreed that it was in the photos about pictures of her and twittered "These so-called naked images of me are FALL, people.
Let's just take the beginnings. *Wortspiel intends*.
Buzzfeed reported on the late Sunday that a spokesman of Popstar Ariana Grande dismissed the authenticity of the supposed photos of her.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's highly promised new novel about love and the letter "J".
They were crushed, so they could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard that one left in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, struggling, intense, distanzed, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shake his hand.
He knew scratch-brushed.
He was stubborn, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this stubbornness was a straight beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than otherwise, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with unmade hairs and a flattering heart from a village on the north island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who considered Kvern to be her aunt, and who had inherited a land in a moist but paradise valley with the appropriate name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were lick, in the bathrooms were still spiders, naked snails had left their marks on all windows and believed they were all of this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like huge coal heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and enticing, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" stands on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced in the next week.
Kvern had eaten with ailins hanging on the broken sun loungers in high grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had ghostly clung into the service console, which provided the country with calming music and sensing news when the view of their crucified brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long forgotten black entertainer, who his father liked to listen to at closed rolling shops in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was banned so properly - just not played.
It has been successfully obsoleted, as the word obsoleseses.
The general taste created what would never have been done and rules, and as the people in books choose the From-Teller washer-to-Millionary monuments, cooking books and romans, they chose the ballads in the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kvern began to play an imaginary piano and sing large feet in a rough-come serenade of Ailin.
Ailin didn't understand that.
"That was a well-known song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he explained and automatically put two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done this to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without two fingers over your lips, it'll cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very fun game at that time, and it wasn't very funny at this time.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what Jazz was.
Ailin had never heard any.
Jazz was not played, even if he was not directly banned.
Improvising was no longer modern.
It was only space for a single "if" in life.
At the beginning of a melody, people wanted to be quite sure where they would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And Jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kvern knew something about jazz about his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers were not black.
Again, no laws or impulses.
A consistent society meant that each element of this society was grateful to agree to the principle of group gift - thankful as those saved from fate.
People of Afro-Caribic origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and body construction, so they sang and ran.
People who originally originated from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as naturally and were responsible for ensuring that no family stayed without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the channelization; what was left of the Greeks, plates crushed.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levante whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country as WHAT HAS HAVE WHERE, WHAT IT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT HAVE BY WHAT HAVE BY WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT HAVE BESKlNG FOR Fireproofing, even fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha-Pfeifen-Restaurants, held in mind and became depressive with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the offensive words that the cheers had just spoken to her could ever be displayed.
Music was expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," said Kvern.
Except for people whose feet are too large.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive feeling of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailins still don't understand.
Why would your father have loved such a thing?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook unfaithful her head and locked Kvern's sight.
There was nothing else to see all over the world than her uncommon ravenous black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you pretend to me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't so directly.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but for that it was too early.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason why you're taking hold of me," he tried it instead.
I'm a little bit perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often brought himself into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the calming charm that one needed to embarrass the cruelty in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be that, Kvern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailin Solomons became red and lifted up from her chair, threw the console around and poured the wine they had drunk.
Holunder blossom wine, so drunkness wasn't apologizing for him.
In her excitement she seemed to be trembling, like Palmweed in the storm.
"And your thickhead is exactly the reason why I feel perverted to you," she said...
Except I'm not at all.
She regretted him, both because of the unnecessary unkindness of his words as well as the fear shown in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he'd beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more detrimental after DEM WHAT HAS WHERE WHAT they had been their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from Kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or defeated them.
Dickhead?
They would have shown her a thick faust if she didn't care!
They first knock - the most commonly used word for erotic attraction between men and women, a countertox to the non-speaking love ball charges from the console - they first knock and then beat.
In Kvern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the use itself was already an act of violence.
Ailin Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He lifted himself out of the chair like an old man.
She also felt blurred, but the wake of his grief surprised her.
That wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew.
She watched him as he removed - as from a room on the top floor, her companion watched him - a man, complained by something he had sworn up himself.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, bowd his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was it a sight she seemed to know well, if she couldn't remember one time when she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was back alone, Ailins looked at Solomon's feet.
Several years before the recent events, Esme Nussbaum worked, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative supervisory body for public mood, at a short talk on the continued violence at low and medium level in exactly the parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolishing, was most expected, in view of the funds and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"It has already been done much, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to relieve the inborn aggression of a people who has led thousands of wars and most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country where the sweet breath of human friendliness was rarely experienced in historical terms despite the highly-examined church towers between the hooks.
But some of the characteristics are unequivocal.
The higher the church tower, the less the passion he continues to awaken.
The population is crying when listening to sentimental ballads, confiscates in stories of overwhelmed difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only the former roughness holds the rural communities as well as our urban structure in the hand, but there are also evidence for the emergence of a new and suspicious strife at home, at the workplace, on the streets and even on the gambling fields.
"They have an unhappy tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he had read the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," answered Esme Nussbaum.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme called for her right to privacy and refusal of the statement.
Feminist?
Still silence.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, reading or feminism.
This is a prejudicious job.
We serve a non-profit society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in itself absolutely acceptable and beneficial, may occasionally distort results as you have suggested them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things which you call "hinder" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as well as expression of a natural force and vitality.
If one continues on the road, WHAT HAVE IS, WHEN IT IS, as if it had happened yesterday, it means to take the country its vital vital vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given to the country in the last quarter century or longer.
Smile at their neighbors, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, speak, explain, listen to, agree to, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the singed word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want to go," answered Esme Nussbaum with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her supervisor had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
My concern is that without warning we may find ourselves again, as we repeat the mistakes that are at all to what is the cause of it.
But this time it's not the others we leave out of our anger and our mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an English patience with that.
"They go too far," he said, "if you describe acts as "error" that our grandparents may have done or not.
They also go too far if you say that these had left their "wraths" and their "misstraus" to "other".
It should actually not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of "us" and "other" when we understand the past as in protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there were no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From whom, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared, "no part of society can claim to have done well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was bad or well done what happened has happened.
That was then.
We don't have to say anything - we agree.
And just as no debt needs to be allocated, no debt must be paid if such a eradication would be appropriate and if there would be a way to cut it out.
But to what does the past serve if we do not learn from it--
The past is that we forget it.
If I can say something about it,
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I'll think of her report," he said and released her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was crossed by a motorcycle driver who, as passers described, had traveled in a kind of "brutal anger" on foot.
There are accidents.
Lesotho Military Member says that no state strike is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the Army in Lesotho argued that they had planned a state strike to the collapse of the government and said that they were opposed to policemen who were accused of armed forces of political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled from the country and informed that the army of the country had changed its office and occupied government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The premier brought his family to the neighbouring South Africa after reporting of attack threats.
Military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there is no state line de facto, but that the military reacts to the threat of "political fanatics", whose armed forces were ahead of the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho's defense forces acted after receiving several secret service reports that within the police some elements were acting that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were shortly facing devastating damage," he said to Voice of America.
South African government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action had made the impression of a crash.
"Even if no one has claimed to have struck the government by violence, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces have so far shown signs of a state war," he said.
On Sunday, speakers of the Lesotho military informed that the soldiers were retired into their barracks and that the situation in the capital was quiet.
In the meantime, Vicepremier Mothetjoya Metsing takes over governmental leadership during Thabane's absence.
Thabane told that he believed he had become a target for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There have been great tensions in Lesotho since June, after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to the conflicts in his unity government.
He said that his actions did not undermine the government, otherwise proclaiming accusations to despite.
Production in the euro area on a 13-month stage
The increase in production in the euro area slowed to the lowest point in the last 13 months in August, according to a precisely observed study.
The final markite shopping manager index of the manufacturing industry (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, after a stand of 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New contracts went down and factories experienced breakdowns in a time of increasing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures shall be recorded before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expect a clear plan for the bank to deal with a deterioration of the euro area and for the threatening deflation at a inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the Head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further information during this week whether it considers a quantitative easing for the euro area, according to those made by the UK and the USA during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the inevitable effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, the largest trading partner in Russia in the EU, fell at the lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
In the meantime, in the second largest economic nation of the block, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as well as the descent of Italy from a solid expansion to stagnation.
Notes that growth incentives in the key industry mechanism no longer take place in Germany as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are also not soothing," said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to shatter the fire of the analysts that expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Head of Economics at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the shopping manager index of the production industry in the eurozone of August is that afterwards the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Producers in the euro area are currently quite difficult to live, as the current increased geopolitical tensions, especially in Russia and Ukraine, increase uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy, especially, and consumer confidence, and probably leads to delaying or even canceling some contracts, especially large orders.
He said that it would be "more likely" that the ECB must eventually introduce a type of QE, "even though we suspect that this will be limited."
The Decade of Hell of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, how the children in it are still suffering today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Czech militias in a school in Beslan in Southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyr that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom at the crueltat.
Just a decade after the terrible siege of the school of Beslan, where 334 people died, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night before a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into abusiveness, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the classroom at the crueltat.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
The end of the war that Ukraine is now undermining - and in which children like them die - is now to be.
The girl who was photographed during the attempt to climb back to the broken school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by the Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakow when she was only trying to climb back to the broken school sports hall after a mine had exploded.
Aida was completely confused and sought her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were considered dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," said Aida at the time.
My legs were bloody.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier made her safe.
After a series of operations, she considered herself completely healed, but yesterday said: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to be operated again.
Some pomegranate fragments are still in my knees.
Their goal is now to become a dentist to help people how she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she said floodyly.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I end my study and begin my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain part of it, although the memory becomes slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see online the photo of me as I climb back to school, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and contribute to the fact that something like this is not happening again.
The boy who fled through the ball hail, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first school day (walking at 7 years) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me that I should lie down when there was an explosion, and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful that she could be dead, he fled and saw on the way a weeping little child, grabbed it by hand and fled through a bullet hail.
His father Wladimir, who closed his son in the outside of his arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
Actually, Tamara had been stolen outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, on the other hand in the assumption that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I cry for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir was later fought to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World), to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion from the then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to be blasser in my memory.
I remember throwing off all my toys guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember these kids I played with in the courtyard, and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially the toy shop where I could choose everything I wanted, and the ride in a top-open car.
But now he is afraid of the place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of calamity that he and his friends suffered.
This horror persecutes you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the abomination," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer last week in a monastery.
I'd like to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me at the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were just no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her journey to London with Damir vigorously.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful for the prize and opportunity to travel to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting her and her husband in London, and how Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat Borschtsch and call them all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with cellars in a restaurant. Damir shot on her with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think this world hasn't improved in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I think many children were killed and still killed.
These are just like our children.
I think for many of the war is part of the news they hear when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he's not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by the past abominations.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they sometimes go to the sports hall and fire candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered under it - I remember how he sometimes sat on the sofa, turned the face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw off all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than I am, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and came to the legs, I looked around, and saw hell around me, with all around body parts.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy couldn't have survived in this hell.
"I remember I called him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was so sure that he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, continues for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image after the siege became the symbol of the abomination of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-flowed face was drawn by fear when he ran around his life, while Czech terrorists shot his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the barbarians of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had put him off for his first school day before she hurried to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, so my little boy stayed there for three terrible days alone," she recalls.
Not entirely alone, there was a whole family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgia managed to survive.
The closer that date comes, the more difficult it is to think about it and talk about it.
There's no day we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time ago, I mean, it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days, always pursuing me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was enforced as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij wanted to go to school this day, and he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on television.
And now there is even this statue of the crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden in the book shelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we ever know the truth.
People constantly investigate such tragedies and never experience the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years are nothing with such pain.
We need dozens of years to forget it a little.
It attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was afraid every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1st September approaches.
I want my old childhood boyfriend's tribute.
It's hard for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I'm not sorry.
My life continues.
I finished school this year and visit a medical university in Vladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgery.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgia Fanijew, 20
The boy who survived even though he was caught at the feet of a murderer terrorist
A miracle: Georgij Fanijew was caught at the feet of a murderer's terrorist, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was caught in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb that was fixed at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
"We feel as if it had been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a secret officer, but could not do this because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the following year - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there and don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is terrible and I wear it with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about school.
I'm okay.
I should be careful with my hurt knee, but I can run well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, also the medical staff, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been there for two years.
He learns the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I knew that I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about this and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's worse in my soul when the anniversary approaches.
I'll go to the celebrations to memorial.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be much more intense for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan all of them are drawn.
It's staying in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that if something so unfair is infringing you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can run, but no sports.
I would say he overcame the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege and that only strengthens my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and they were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know about families in which new children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life continues, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart jumped into me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can't believe that.
We were a friendly country before, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many are killed.
If we could only grab and throw all these rebels out - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tsjewa, 10
The baby that was worn in safety by a special commission
Gerettet: Aljona Tskajewa is secured by a Russian special commission (left).
It is now ten (right) and does not remember the cruelties at all
The world stopped the breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was born in the arms of a Russian policeman from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in her cruelty, her 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar kept back in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous killer.
Her father, Ruslan, has married again since then and has with his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he has named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, today's ten years old, doesn't remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, says neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.

4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection of devices.
The most affordable option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action-cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which can be both for about $300.
I have taken these photos at a family festival with several cameras, which are all available at a price of less than $350.
Depending on the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery box and other subjects are closed.
Set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and Camcorder have scene and recording modes that optimize the lighting time for the impaired underwater conditions.
And before you jump into, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search in our shopping guide and the evaluations for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Make multiple recordings - because many will not fold.
Point-and-shoot cameras have a LCD that you can compose images, action-cams usually do not have.
Even if you have a LCD, it is difficult to watch this under water, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So take a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode with which a number of recordings are made with slightly modified lighting settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse, the further you remove from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you make recordings in a pool, a lake or the sea.
By doing so you can also bring more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is even more important under water because of bad light conditions.
It is especially important if you work with an action-cam: these devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they should fill the entire frame of the image.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the variety whose character changes things, even in a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an advisory anaesthesia doctor, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employees who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnosis and diseases are important to the doctors, while the subjects are mainly busy with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulty raising myself.
While fighting with the grip-like symptoms, he noticed that he made unpatient accusations to his wife Juliet.
"I'd rather like everything immediately than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt very unusual and unreasonable.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to conduct an X-ray examination of his breast.
Only two weeks ago he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesotheliom, an unhealable cancer that attacks the chest fell, i.e. the skin that surpasses the lungs.
As with most cancer diseases, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers are smoking pulmonary cancer, not all lung cancers have previously been smokers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which once was considered as a miraculous substance but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can as easily ignore.
Asbestos is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbestos type has not been used in Britain since the 1960s than the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Also where he was still employed, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - glue, construction workers, roommen and yard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another time, it seems hardly worrying today.
But this self-sufficiency is inappropriate.
Great Britain, it seems to experience the highlight of a mesoltheliom epidemic today.
There are more deaths due to Mesotheliom here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die of this disease as in traffic accidents.
Annual numbers of mesotheliom deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason why we experience the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (1999 were prohibited all asbestos types), is that a mesotheliom develops only after decades.
And the assassination of the Mesotheliom is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore Mesotheliom knows no class barriers, financial limits, occupations or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shops in London to private schools, are not a protection room.
Parliament buildings are asbestos-degraded.
Even in the hospitals in which we are to be healthy, this deadly carcinogen has already been set out as the base of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't a glue either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come in contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I completed my training for six years." he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and peasants - use the tunnel.
You wonder how many my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"From the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have suffered from Mesotheliom in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us will be sick?
In Andrew Lawson, Mesotheliom was diagnosed at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, this year, he was 55.
That was an unusual long time of survival.
Fifty percent of the mesothelio detectives die within 8 months of the diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us are still being affected?"
The UKâ€™s leading expert on Mesotheliom, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to occur in Britain, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have been victimized.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like that.

A brief look at the acts of the courts, which are often addressed by the victims because of claims to damage, shows how far the assaults of the Mesotheliom are already spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that Janice Allen had negligently exposed asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of them the flagship store in Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started her work at M&S.
Now she has two children in the twentieth.
"For this thing," she says, "I've never heard of Mesotheliom, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me once.
There are only a few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers, not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "Asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the substance resistant and flexible.
Three out of six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It was used for roof plates, floor plates, raw risolations, boile risulations, even for brake covers in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but it is still considered by the EU and the WHO as a "great health risk" with possible death consequences.
However, the brown asbestos (Amosit) and the blue asbestos (Krokydolith) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliomrates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to Alamy at the flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesotheliom sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her history is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of the affected people, stating that "a substantial proportion of the mesotheliomes without known suspension by work or in the house was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
Most of these contacts are based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It looks like no one could pretend to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of the government could have been unknowingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009 Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament's committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibres could be pollinated by something as harmless as "strong air movements".
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it seems to be the opposite.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the West Minster Palace has received a "clean health certificate", it is now unanimous that 1 billion Â£ work effort has to be imposed over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the general elections in 2015, Members will probably meet in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than on the green banks in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the existence of asbestos was not handled according to the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost life.
All you can do is wait.
A person who could never exactly determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to the asbestos during his work in hospitals.
"I have worked in a hospital where asbestos complaints were positively decided," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places you worked on, and the data.
What he remembers is the day at the beginning of December 2009 on which he received such a kind of fever.
He was 45 years old, and he performed an operation just late in the evening.
Suddenly, I had shitlfrost.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make the journey home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain of the chest fell, the skin around his lungs, caused.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesotheliom.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors made X-ray recordings of his chest and put on Pleurakathether to extract liquid from the lungs and test in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after sporting activity and intense breathing.
In 2011, a patient received abbots with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesotheliom.
But even now Abbott did not link this to his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011 Abbott's condition deteriorated and his doctor brought his CT scans and X-ray recordings to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbot had felt sick for the first time, a probe equipped with a camera was introduced into the cave between the rib and the chest fell.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just continue," he says.
Honestly, I didn't worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "It was told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Mesotheliom
Suddenly Abbott had dates with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended him to take a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often isolated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings now suffer.
Mesotheliom now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos in hospitals were below the earth, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many of the employees who ate in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (such as Andrew Lawson) or in underground cantons (such as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It appears that over several decades after the war hospitals may have been life-saving but life-threatening for the treatment doctors.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flaming properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Everywhere in the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, pupils have placed their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The issue of asbestos in schools is often addressed on websites.
And so innocent items in our houses, such as floor plates or roof roofs, have normally included asbestos.
"It is an industrial gift that is contained in large parts of our properties," says Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that a woman affected was the demolition of a garden ship in the 1970s.
So watch out how you're breaking off your garden.
The effects of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is unhealable is immense.
"It takes a while to process this," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I won't have another Christmas party.
With the greatest difficulty, the perspective change from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient was.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to take all of this," he says.
"I asked my doctor how long do I have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I won't experience another Christmas party.
It was."
Mesotheliom is particularly suspicious because it is our life-keeping mechanism - breathing itself - that causes fatal cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos consists of smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is inhaled and the fibers are inhaled, they can put in the chest fell, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the chest fell and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who changed to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Just the hospital, from which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos reach the pulmonary tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancers do not work so well in mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is controversial.
Some think she's worth an attempt.
Treasures necessarily.
"You can't cut the chest fell out," he says.
They don't come around with the knife.
For that reason, the cancer "does not very well address chemotherapy," which "Effection Shows", but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," says Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting Mesotheliom, Abbott came in contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and consultancy office for the participants four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, Cancer Centre," he presented himself happy when calling.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, abbots were offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and expected to extend his life only by one month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "make things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not being rejected, I just called and got a date," admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesotheliom patients in order to observe the best available therapies.
But if these treatments eventually fail, many affected people are of another financial concern - about the future of the families that leave them behind.
And so they turn to the judgments in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan by Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that a very low load was also a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally explained their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "complete compensation" because Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesotheliom was due to an asbestos contact with the Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, however, a spokesman of the Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibres in the affected cellar area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, it is for mesotheliom patients who strive for compensation to assign a huge problem to the deadly asbestos contact of a company or a job - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who oppose claims know that the time is for them, but certainly not with the prosecutors.
In response to this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for Mesotheliom subjects to complaints of compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to find out.
The law has established a Â£350 million funds fund fund funded by the insurance industry for all who have been diagnosed after July 2012 can prove contact but nobody can sue.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have addressed to them in a normal compensation process - about Â£120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected per year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioms affected that Â£350 million were a "very good work" of the insurance industry.
"This is a deal of insurers for insurers," he says, and suggests that this sum is a quarter of what insurers should have paid if the time had not passed over and Mesotheliom patients could find the companies and normally succumb them.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
However, both penning and Morgan admitted that in view of seven death victims, fast action was necessary daily.
"The people suffer so much and need help today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December last year.
At that time Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first discussions, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation that he expects a positive effect in contrast to Tom Treasure.
This has been accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a three-fold therapy with which long-Lazdunski can present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"Of course, this is with the most important," Abbott says.
It's always seen in patients.
There's something that lets you go on.
If you give up, you're going to be much worse.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just got 50.
This is not life threatening.
That's life-effective.
Again Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
No more trace of the Tumore is visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very struggling.
You have to think about practical things - about the money if I'm no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you'll be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
"For parents, it's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girl I had a disease with which I wouldn't get old.
They responded very differently.
Tamsin is very cozy and stupid.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was reluctant.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to endure.
But for mesothelio-notifiers, such conversations are not through hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings an horrible security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not life threatening.

China refuses Hong Kong right to government election, demonstrators swear retribution
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided despite the increased calls for democratic reforms against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong voters.
This approach is likely to illuminate the long-pronounced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists led the planning and mobilisation to do so within a few hours after the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders in principle to reject all non-peking-treated candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said lawyer Emily Lau, Chairman of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing had promised.
They lied to Hong Kong's inhabitants.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an autoritary regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vicegeneral Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong Government would be "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain returned control over Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised that the inhabitants will be given the government presidency from 2017 onwards.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision as a democratic breakthrough from Sunday because there is a direct election right to Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership keeps the course firmly in hand by a closely controlled nomination committee of Beijing.
After a new clause, only candidates should be admitted "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong have been taking place for several years.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shoot the financial district if Beijing does not allow any real general electoral law.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Occupy Central trailers had gathered in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong within a few hours after the announcement.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and planned protest waves in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide further information to prevent problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organizers informed that the movement "has considered the occupation of the central district only as the last means, an action that will only take place when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and no other choice exists.
We are sorry to say that all dialogue opportunities have been exhausted today and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the announcement of Beijings for days, and there were stronger security measures, including police forces and barricads on Sunday before the government building.
The unrest is strengthened by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control of their city.
The accession of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
In addition, the fear that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, under the growing pressure of Beijing, begin to fall.
Some criticized the demonstrations of the Occupy Central Movement as they threatened the business - the life vein of Hong Kong.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said lawyer Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to be afraid that Hong Kong is going out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
The state-controlled media of China also recently reported on the democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the electoral rights where 780,000 people participated - more than one fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
In July, tens of thousands participated in one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the history of the region.
The tradition of school graduate balls in the USA is now transferred to universities where freshmen performances are offered with the private aircraft.
We are looking forward to responding to this demand and offering the first luxury travel service of Great Britain for students today.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also indicated that the service had a security saving.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who otherwise would have to cushion their Habitats in a dangerously overloaded car through the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
One speaker said that no new bookings were yet available since the service had just been introduced, but added that "Students would book the service in the next weeks".
The company also informed that despite the study fees of Â£ 9,000 a year, it expected a market for this offer.
Students today, in their expectations and claims, are very different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for Higher Education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the life of the majority of students.
Many students who start study this month are exposed to a crisis of living costs, since the available financial aid in the form of loans and scholarships does not keep with the strongly rising invoices step for the simplest basis of life before they can even remember spending thousands of pounds for something as simple as arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize racial and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teen was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo. at the beginning of this month.
The participants lifted their hands into the air and sang, "Hose up, don't shoot," while they waited before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, because of the shooting of the unarmed teen Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez observed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to their experience, white feminist commentators put the sex before the race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequality.
However, while the tensions in the Middle West rose and received attention throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women turned to 100% around the race.
Compared to the answers of black women shortly after the shots of August 9th, the personal essays with titles such as "Thinks to Ferguson of a white woman" and "Feminism not only focuses on the oppression of women" came relatively late.
But for Perez this meant an important change.
"I don't think that in feminism you will find many people who are white and speak privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt impressed to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis in which we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so etnized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell from Ohio State University, Ferguson revealed problems that black Americans are subjected to every day, but they are not regarded as "women themes" in cultural space.
"I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colorful in their own country are defeated, silence is deceptive.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, who have studied racial, gender and sexuality in the history of the USA, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender problems.
For them black women did not have the luxury to separate the topics cleanly; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now combine the topics of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lined, and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in history to justify the Lynchmord.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white fighters for women's election law such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for election law could only be successful for one group: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to apply to women's electoral law, and the right of election for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
Remembering such things, you become aware of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't make our job good.
We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women received the right of election in 1920, it took a decade to organize white women against the bandage in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was created almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flut of white feminist reactions to questions raised by Ferguson - police behaviour, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminist women played "fears" with the problems that black women have been dealing with since generations.
"Will it not be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to reception control?", Mitchell asked.
Feminists of the second generation, who built up their career on the fight for reproduction rights and access to reception prevented resources, are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist of the Guardian, in which she demands more protests from white Americans on racism.
"I hope that women who have another but parallel reason for understanding a risk of the body - and opinions about race that are quite different in public surveys - will lead to the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial as well as gender topics are addressed, some of their comments on racial theme in America are astonished.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" said to She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and hispanic men, there were angry reactions from many feminist women, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes into the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police attacked nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwest border of the country this year, the issue of immigration reform is also reappeared to the surface - this time as a women theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chairman of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a reconsideration of the topic as an essential women's theme, she should only publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the large majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position in which they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reputation in the women's organizations," she said.
"Swine house" in Ipswich stands for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents, as it became clear that it showed a large pig that it had made it comfortable in the living room.
The free-standing house has a bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for Â£120,000.
Among the details was an illustration of the living room of the house - one of which was a pig, that his head had bed on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said that the pig on the photo was the pet of the owner.
"The photo, however, has been misrepresented and has been removed in the meantime," said one speaker of the company.
In the ExposÃ© of the House, Connells described the former Assembly House as a "unique single family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it appears still on advertising material.
House sale provided interest in the social media when some asked whether the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after Lotto win
A lottery player from Harvey this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth lasts, with a happy winner who gets from the lottery on Saturday nearly $1.1 million.
A newspaper skiosk in Harvey moved the jackpot in the first division for the second time in five years, after 1 million dollars in November 2009.
However, the happy winner still needs to report.
The shop owner Steve Forward said that the profit would provide for conversation material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city speaks of nothing else, and all are quite excited.
We thought such a profit could take place.
Eight WA winners celebrated profits in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont had gained the mega gain of 7,5 million dollars just a few weeks before.
The winner couple had played for twenty years and said that the profit allowed them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the Gladiatorenarena
Not only were the gladiators in the Matsch at the first Rhinebacher Roman Day in the recreational park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who detested the rainseeers and the autumn cold and were completely enthusiastic about the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful range of representations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force from the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust fighting art in the soft sand-prepared arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and wise presenter and sent his men to the ring to the heroic two struggle in various gladiator genuss.
At first, the "provocators" were on the line with rectangular sign and short gravity, as well as leg rail on the left leg and armchair on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed with chest shield, short gravity and wurflant as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Especially impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who joined the "Secutor" with Wurfnet, Dreizack and Dolch and struck the Burschen to the ground after a short struggle.
As forces the swords metallicly joined each other, the shields shrew and the rollers flew through the arena, that a fear and bange could become around the health of gladiators.
But on that the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular arbitrator, had a always attentive eye.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era viable," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, Chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis RÃ¶merkanal", the intent behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the recreational park became a "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage found in his greeting word.
Finally, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remnants of it were also to be magnified at the Roman Day, such as "AquÃ¤dukt marble" from the 11 meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Channel bridge, which once stood at LÃ¼ftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once presented water and energy supply, and now compared, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time."
This also confirms diploma measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger from the "Ingenieur TeamZwei" from Rheinbach, who introduced the instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations anno 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocous, warm air heating, which once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressively, too, the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millenniums ago in the footsteps of sound before they were burned.
In 2011, the Federal Ministry of the Finance of the Land Association of Rhineland excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Commercial Park in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building have been found with a dairy to dry grain and to meal.
The building probably belonged to a villa of Rustica, an agricultural property, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
A number of finds from these excavations presented it in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels and parts of a delicious necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century after Christ, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, believes Morscheiser.
The children also worked with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax plates, like the Roman pupils once.
At the stand of the Roman thermals ZÃ¼lpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, bastle at the stand of the glass museum Rheinbach Glasmosaiken and use a heavy wheat mill made of stone at the state of the natural centre of Eifel Nettersheim to meal the flour for a flavored bread or a musli.
With the originally rebuilt Roman cars drawn by two cold flowers, visitors traveled through the recreational park and also passed the impressive state of the urban gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman Project Weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the community of Wachtberg will also enter the Rhineland-Russia Roman Year 2014, which is supposed to remember the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Watchberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein und die Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings as well as guided tours for school classes are offered and remember the Roman past of Wachtbergs.
For example, a Roman legionary will be told of his work on the upcoming Wachtberg, presenting plants as living monuments from the Roman era and presenting a fun lesson on international understanding between a group of "German" and enlisted Romans.
The Adendorf primary school devotes itself to the Roman theme within a week of a project.
With the Roman Week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be re-experienced.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will remember the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The Epidemic burdens West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a serious blow for the economy.
Markets are obscured - and international companies go to distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic causes a severe blow to the economy of West Africa.
The harvest rottes on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are abandoned - the virus has hardly added to the region.
Some international companies are also already remote.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis but also an economic crisis," judges the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest affected
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
On the market only who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia has been hit the hardest by the virus, here alone more than 600 people were victims of the fever.
Recently, the health authorities explained that the disease had occurred in every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people died, and thousands of others were involved.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Overall in the resource-rich countries, companies dispose of their business.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal withdraw their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the regions concerned.
The local distributors and farmers also respond: few merchants leave their homes to get them.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantines, among other things, the major cocoa and coffee beans in the fields were rotting.
The farmers don't dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food becomes scarce
"The people will travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Paris expert for the economy of West Africa.
For example, the man who normally goes to the market and sells his vegetables would rather stay home.
Therefore, the population gets the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food becomes scarce.
In the markets, the stock is decreasing in basic foods such as rice.
At the same time, the region dependent on international companies threatens an image damage - with far-reaching consequences.
The greatest danger is that international companies are basically avoiding the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French Think Tank Iris.
Decisive is how far and how long the virus will spread.
In the case of investors, the impression could arise that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the straped state budgets of the States
The disease also burdens the government budgets of the countries concerned.
The Moody's rating agency fears that their budgets are strongly stressed by the high expenditure on the health system and also by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help the health systems of the countries concerned with $60 million (EUR 45 million).
The effects are already evident in Nigeria, where only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the south of Nigerdelta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already at home from fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also significantly reduced.
Protecting her 50th anniversary
The "TÃ¤nenwald" Berngau SchÃ¼tzenverein celebrates its 50-year-old founding festival from 12 to 14 September.
On high tours, the preparations for the 50th anniversary of the founding festival will run from 12 to 14 September at the TÃ¤nnwald SchÃ¼tzenverein.
Planned on Friday, September 12th, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday at 6:00 a.m., the big bÃ¶ller shooting will be.
Afterwards, in the large festival is the mood evening with the "StoapfÃ¤lzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle cares for the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festival service and 9.30 p.m. in the parish church and the great festival at 14 p.m.
In the afternoon there is also the distribution of the price of the Federal and GauschieÃŸen.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive women with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert FÃ¼racker have taken over.
The original name "SchÃ¼tzengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" originated in 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment using exercise in room support and small calibration shooting".
In 1937, the NS regime caused the association to be dissolved.
Only in 1964 again found 19 young men who, on April 30, took the "new" SchÃ¼tzenverein "TÃ¤nnwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club as a shooting master through a difficult start time, in which it was mainly about finding a club place and installing the shooting operation.
In the autumn of 1965, the SchÃ¼tzenverein started in the "Leininger" guest house with two teams in the round races.
In the following years, the sports guards, now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records purple each year and the magical border of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active protectors has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" club has no longer satisfied the requirements of a modern SchÃ¼tzenverein, the then board under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future home in the cellar rooms of the new "Landgasthof HÃ¤rteis".
After a worktime of 2700 hours, on 8 May 1988 pastor Strasser gave the church blessing for the new shelters.
One of the major highlights in the association history was certainly the 44th fast shooting, coupled with the solemn fence of the new protective flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the SchÃ¼tzenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary of the foundation.
A BÃ¶ller Group was established in 1995.
Joseph Schmalzl became BÃ¶llerreferent.
A major challenge for the "BÃ¶llerers" and for the association as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian BÃ¶ller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of honorary work, the club members last year modernized the rooms and shooting facilities at the Berngauer Hof and thus brought them to the latest state of technology.
Elf teams in round competitions
You can also see the sports performance of the Protecting Association.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air weapons forces, an air-pistol mandate, a sports pistool KK1, a youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has risen to the districtsliga 1 in 2013/14 from the Gauoberliga (highest Liga in the SchÃ¼tzengau ANB).
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as bock steaks, facing and kingball, club excursion and Christmas celebration have tradition.
With it the guards are also at the festivals in parish and municipality.
Tony Stewart suffers accident when returning to the race track
Tony Stewart's return to the race track ended about halfway through his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre was poured into round 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team chief Chad Johnston said that his 14-member team was disappointed, but now concentrate on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better use and a better result for him," said Johnston.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping we can make it better there.
Stewart went to a wall earlier on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to repair the right side of his car.
"I went into today with quite good hopes for a good result," said Johnston and added, "it just didn't work."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the slepper and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart left three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another driver at an ash track race in the north of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the persecution.
He returned to his workplace, during an investigation to the tragic incident that led to the death of Kevin Ward Jr., which had taken place during a race to face Stewart.
On Friday, the authorities notified that the investigations for the cause of the accident will continue to last for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been taken whether Stewart has to expect a charge.
The three-time champion was received with a great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start at 12. position, Stewart was shortly afterwards pushed into the first 10 and was temporarily on place four.
After a reboot in round 122, raided bushs
Cars with no. 18 except control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with stewart, both cars drove against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to place 21.
Dance-friended offspring searched
Just try out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and Head Lisa Neitzel (from left) look forward to controversy.
Like many other associations, the jazz groups in TV Jahn create full-day teaching at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated strongly.
Now young people are more and more searched for a sport that is healthy and makes great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", are only nine children.
"Three in the group of eight to twelve years old, six in the group of twelve to 15 years old," the 20-year-old says.
With more actives, the whole would make much more fun, "you could dance quite different choreography," she says.
If you want to dance, you can get into your training hours without obligation between 17 and 18 o'clock or Friday between 17 and 18.30 o'clock in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, FreistraÃŸe 9.
"The training begins regularly with a warming program," says the trainer.
Thereafter, various choreography is exercised.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no defined form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore about classics up to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, social affairs are not too short.
"We're going to eat, watch dance films, and we've already stayed in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group one could close friendships, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for its own motor development.
Whoever isn't the dance of jazz, he can also snuff in one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and adolescents can always get into the classes in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance trainer is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who desire Discofox, Slow Walzer, Vienna Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can see and join.
Bulgarian prisoners protest country-wide
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a countrywide protest before the Ministry of Justice in the capital of Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been modified.
Higher salaries are also on a list of claims to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have protested symbolicly for a month against the new working hours and demand a return to the previous 24-hour boats.

Ukrainian Army has abandoned Luhansk Airport
In eastern Ukrainian, the pro-Russian fighters continue to march.
After severe fighting, which supposedly also involved Russian tankbataillons, the Ukrainian army has abandoned the airport of the rebel highburg Luhansk today, Monday.
At the same time, the army informed that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroschenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeat of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the supreme army leadership without mention.
Prorussian separatists shot off plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have once again shot a fighter and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in fighting in the Donezk region, according to Russian agencies on Monday.
Coastal Guard vessels reduced
The opposed people also claimed to have reduced two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard for the first time in the Asovian Sea.
The Ukrainian border protection confirmed that two of his ships were under fire on Sunday near the harbour city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards had been injured, said a speaker in Kiev to the station 112.ua.
Two crew members were deemed missing.
Local media made Russia responsible for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had under control of several villages in the Donezk area.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
Today, the Ukraine Contact Group meets in the Belarusian capital Minsk.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an ambassador of the eastern Ukrainian separatists should also participate in this.
In advance, all stakeholders used their performances to publicly disclose their claims.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned stationations in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday that the NATO will comply with the 1997 founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO Chief, however, accused Russia of the agreement "a scratch break".
"Today we have to see the reality that Russia does not view NATO as a partner," says Rasmussen.
Documents and statements from Russian side "that they consider us opposed".
Strengthen NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced to want to strengthen NATO presence in Eastern Europe.
A "readiness action plan" to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is needed," said Rasmussen in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
According to Russia and Ukraine, official data have agreed on new discussions on the settlement of their gas dispute.
The negotiations were launched for next Saturday, said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak on Monday.
It is still waiting for the European Union to decide whether it also sends a representative on the discussions.
Due to the dispute about the gas price, Ukraine has not received fuel from Russia for weeks.
Lastly, EU Energy Commissioner GÃ¼nther Oettinger provided between both sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt gas supply for Europe.
Europe refers to about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks Powerword: Toll will come "very clear"
Now, the Chancellor is clear about it again.
It's not a free letter for all complicated details.
Continuous concerns from the CDU against the car toll have horrified the CSU at the same time.
Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel has spoken a powerful word for the introduction of a car toll after persistent resistance from her CDU.
"To make it clear: it is in the coalition contract, and it will come," said the party chief on Monday after meetings of the CDU teams in Berlin.
However, Merkel did not initially lay down a detailed model.
In the black-red government programme, it is called "definite parameters".
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and it is now being further worked on.
However, the NRW CDU persists on their no to a toll on all streets.
Merkel stressed that Minister of Finance Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble (CDU) also contributes constructively to the discussions for a draft law.
He also spoke with Dobrindt about further opportunities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, such as broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special." SchÃ¤uble had left a "spiegel" report uncommentarly on Sunday, his house checks its own concept of remunerating motorway investors with mature revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU-Chef Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the federal minister in the cabinet.
CDU-Bundesvize Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition treaty never assumed to excite all the circular and federal roads," said the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU country chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk again about the subject.
Resistance against the plans also comes from the CDU country associations Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
Background are fears that a toll affects small border transport to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition care for the toll criticism of the CDU.
The left views the plans as failed in the face of the Union's dispute.
"The Murks-Mut is dead," said Party Chief Bernd Riexinger of the "New OsnabrÃ¼cker Zeitung" (Montag).
"With the toll the minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignet obligation on all German roads that will start in 2016.
Inland car owners may not be additionally burdened according to coalition contract.
Therefore, they should receive full compensation for the toll through the car controls.
However, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disturbance often wrongly diagnosed
A British woman said she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in the belief that she had to live only a few years after she had been diagnosed with another disease.
It actually suffered from the charcot marie tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disturbances that damage the nerves outside the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK informed that misdiagnosis are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Approximately 23,000 people in Britain are likely to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weaknesses, uncertain gangs, and crushed toes.
Patients also suffer from deafness or pain. The disease is unhealable and progressive, which means that the symptoms become worse in time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed that she suffered from Friedreich's Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very bad chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the wheelchair before she would 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children today, 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew that I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell down constantly and everything took longer with me.
I was never able to drive with the other children rolling shoe or skateboard and was often haunted at school because of my way of walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13 she saw her health certificates when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA company," she said.
When I was given an answer, I was shocked and scared in panic.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair with 18 and die with 25, and that would slowly lose all my skills.
I made this all out with me alone and planned my own funeral.
She said, when she was 17, she became aware that her skills had not taken away as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and embraced me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, or you're already in the wheelchair."
I think you have something much less life threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected.
"When he told me what was CMT, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as fireworks since the closure of the former troop exercise place
For nearly ten years, there has been no shooting at the former Truppentraining Square in MÃ¼nsingen.
Nevertheless, each month, killing ammunition appears in the heart of the biosphere area of SchwÃ¤bische Alb.
The granates are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be spared on site.
An ore-deceived knall halls over the heartpiece of the biosphere area in the springs.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell on the MÃ¼nsingen Army Exercise Station, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since this time, the 6500 hectares large area has been the core part of the SchwÃ¤bische Alb biosphere area, which is open on 13 designated paths for hikers and cyclists.
Tax taxation of businessmen in Washington area increases with economic recovery
Recreation of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for businesses in the country slightly increased last year, while economic recovery accelerated, such a newly published study last week, and the companies in Washington area were no exception.
Companies in District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local authorities in the financial year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to the 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent in the previous year, and it was the third year of growth following the several years of declining 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study carried out by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenues come from companies.
Virginia earns the lowest tax revenue from companies by 28 percent.
A large part of the increase in tax revenue is based on a recovery of the real estate values of companies, the researchers say, which led to a 3.7 percent increase in real estate taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the expiry seems to be true for Washington.
District, Maryland and Virginia companies jointly paid over $10 billion to state and local real estate taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - an increase by 4.2 percent over a year.
However, the apparent recovery of real estate values in Maryland is not so effective in increasing government and local tax revenues, as the real estate taxes amount to almost more than one fifth of the tax decisions of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their government and local taxes in the form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland the following is happening: a large part of the property, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay for property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Managing Director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to provide the same services that other countries offer.
The recent recovery of tax revenue by companies cannot be attributed to the recreation of the real estate market alone
The data also appears to recover corporate revenue.
Companies in the region reported income taxes for state organisations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took 1 billion dollars in corporate income taxes, the highest amount of the region.
While the trend goes in the same direction, local taxation for companies does not increase evenly in all three places.
The increase in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a lower average tax income of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has, at 6 percent in all three areas of office, the lowest taxes on corporate income (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Trade at the beginning of this year showed that in Virginia, lower government and local company taxes are required and there is a better tax climate in total than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure by its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will decrease to 5 percent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income targets in the next year, this law could reduce the State's income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
In the meantime it seems to be better for small businesses in Washington area, so they pay more government and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen - a transitional structure, according to which most small businesses are organized - increased by 20 percent in the district, Maryland and Virginia last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than total corporate taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes throughout the country will probably continue this year, with an increase in general multi-resistance tax revenue for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Washington area could fall behind if the Federal Government's reduction of expenditure affects the labour market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also in China a popular combination.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a flight direct connection between the two cities.
Deutsches Bier, brown in Frankfurt's partner town Guangzhou - so is the urgency of officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery would stay in our city," said Vice-Parte Secretary of the South Chinese Metropole, Li Yiwei, this week at visiting a SPD delegation in his city.
During the discussion, the functionary of China's ruling Communist Party repeatedly returned to this concern of the twelve million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also called canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, wasb Li.
Therefore, people also own the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The hessian SPD president Thorsten SchÃ¤fer-GÃ¼mbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would rehearse himself in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"For beer it does not need much: good water, cereals and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party superintendent in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already shines out Mr. Li, he smiled to the host.
The functioner from Guangzhou then arrived with sheep gimbles - but with red wine served for the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewery.
Tsingtao-Bier is brewed after the German purity command.
More trade
A second request from the Chinese hosts would be a flight direct connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Parteichef Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight, but deleted in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worthwhile again," the local politician proved to be convinced.
"Business between our two cities is continuing to increase."
At present, travelers had to take the way over Changsha in Hunan Province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital Guangzhou is, also hopes for the flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this desire in his discussion with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," replied SchÃ¤fer-Gumbel - Chinese Vice-Minister Li Jinjun, a intimate German scholar.
Maintenanced partnership
Guangzhou's simplified Vice-Participant hopes he will be able to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already at the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to office this year only after his predecessor had been transported from the office because of corruption claims.
The local party chief Wan Qinglian also had to go.
The action against the officials of Guangzhou is part of a country-wide campaign against corruption in party and administration, which is enforced with hardness by head of State Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked before his party career for an American company, which is most unusual in the Communist Party of China.
Prior to his office in Guangzhou, he worked as a top functioner in Fujian, where the car builder VW builds a large work.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to the 9000 kilometres away Guangzhou belongs to those maintained by both sides, for example with a pupil exchange.
Last year, the 25-year-old existence of the German-Chinese link was celebrated.
The South Chinese metropolis on the pearl flow is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen with its economic power.
The next year she wanted to reach a gross domestic product of EUR 250 billion, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "press the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since her delivery to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter has now hopefully demonstrated that the 81-year-old comicin recovers from her disease.
"Thank you for your enduring love and support," said Melissa Rivers today in a message.
We're pushing all the thumbs.
According to her mother, on Thursday after an emergency in a hospital at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, he was sent to the Mount Sinai Hospital.
The doctors will deliberately keep them sedated and under careful observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as "earth".
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of an overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
More strict environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners coming into the market as of today.
Like cooling cabinets and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners receive a label from September 1 on which the buyer can detect central data such as the energy efficiency of the device.
For new cars, in the pollutant class "Euro 6" are more stringent nitrogen oxide values.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolders: they receive a federally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon purchases Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information reported on Monday morning: the online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - buys the video streaming service Twice for $1.04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because no one had expected a acquisition of Twitch, but because it was far suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion thing decided, and the cooperation also appeared natural.
Twitch, founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bouquets in games, a "YouTube for live games", says an insider.
The Twinch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which better exchangers give the (mostly older) games a touch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It is just so that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the message that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up somewhat boringly, a book example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube was not done, as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this at the moment is this statement by Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We have decided for Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there sooner."
Another secret, honestly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me, who explain that they prefer to play sports rather than watching, it is difficult to understand the attraction that is supposed to look at others while playing instead of taking the control console into hand.
It's one thing to watch a friend over the shoulder at 3:00 a.m. while she slides by Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a spider shooting him 20 times in Call of Duty's head.
All these games could just watch you.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without own control over the perspective can be a very good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast cycles in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete all games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humor virtuosis, its twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics know like me already?
Twitch is called from 55 million different visitors a month and is the fourth largest source of Internet traffic tips.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money?
It is difficult to imagine that Twitch is integrated in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube Twitch could have swallowed.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who are recruited as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch "believe both in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - sluck - as a spectator sport.
On the HÃ¼pfburg at the Burggartenfest, there was a lot to go on Sunday evening.
The organizers' concept was right.
Despite the strong rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
In time, the introduction had to be stopped.
"That was angry," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt weed l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the Open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten is intended to radiate brightness during the day and evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes from alone anyway.
This was already shown on the early Sunday evening when the first visitors went up to the Open Air.
The organizers had promised a festival for all generations.
And they have succeeded.
Around the supply levels on the Burggartenwiese it had made salt wedelers, but also guests from the nearby and further surroundings comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, wipped with the foot in the tact, enjoyed cool drinks - short: relaxation pur and enjoyment were demanded.
And that's all over the generations.
While the one leaned on the blanket on the extra-carred white sand on the beach bar, others labored at a quarter of wine in the Vinothek, the younger grower was on the hillburg, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even when the children were grinding, the volunteers had to do all the hands full in the truest sense of the word to become master of the Andrang and to enchant imaginative creations into the little faces.
The larger used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew was organized from salt tubing.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 17.30 p.m., he poured down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry ones.
But the attractivity of the festival did not cancel this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line".
Therefore, a repetition of the big party in the next year is not opposed.
Although it still needs to be worked on the content and size of the event, Sem made clear in a first balance on Sunday to the folk vote.
As annoying, he said that intermediately the initiation had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security company had been booked with too little powers.
The result: Some who had already paid came to the ground no longer.
The resonance was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors who tumbled in the Burggarten.
There were problems with sound technology.
The salt weaver Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox broke off their appearance.
The technicians were unable to create a semi-proof sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to salt waist due to a tyre pan.
"But next year they will be there," says the organizer.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will still be forgotten for the first time but must be eliminated in the second edition.
Also in the social network Facebook, the organizers must inject criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier says on the event side.
"You have taken you a little," said Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so close.
I think it's very good that some do not only scream stupid, but also really try to put something on their legs.
Hate off!", writes Stephanie JenÃŸ to the Amula.
Now the organizers remain a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Watchberg's watermark shrinks
That's not what it's expected to be.
Rather, the ready component awaits the use of the remarkable building.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the creation of the TIRA Space Observation radar, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller with a diameter of 47,5 meters than the old one.
But the size still remains world record.
The last step to complete the new shell is the cap exchange
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and taken with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is set up.
If the weather plays, the action should go through the stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge takes up jaws
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This Ice-Bucket hallenge went painfully.
A woman was brought to the hospital after she had screamed so much at the Ice-Bucket-Challenge that she ran out of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom circled so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt her face structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did, my jaws remained simple," she said to The Mirror.
Ice water is spilled over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't go, the jaw was hacked, and then I understood something was wrong.
My mom and my sister saw this too and smileed almost in the pants, but I had to take the emergency.
The 20-year-old from Great Britain was hospitalized to reappear the jaw after participation in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an Internet sensation and a thousand times to Facebook and Twitter.
Soon the castle clubs pull back on a strang?
Lastly, there were often dwarf between the two Wolfratshaus Burgvereinen.
Now the boards think about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the deceased Richard Dimbath, former president of the Wolfratshaus Burgfreunde, led the project in the French GuÃ©delon.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunds Wolfratshausen.
The views of the history of the Wolfratshaus Castle and possible reconstruction seemed very different so far.
Now the two camps are moving to each other: talks about a common approach will soon be made.
This confirms the association boards Torsten SjÃ¶berg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could put together once," reports SjÃ¶berg.
He believes that all members of the two associations could in the future again take a stand.
So there are faster visible successes.
While the Burgfreunds around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the "creation and survival" of the terrain for the Burgverein around SjÃ¶berg is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreund, was very pleased according to his own information on the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been presenting the Burgfreunds.
A new chairman is to be found in a membership meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the club currently counts around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we left the association activities out of respect first." This "thinking phase" was needed to "consider how it could continue".
According to Piffl, the new Chairman will then go to the discussion with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunds could also make a current mood picture within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the Presidency, says Piffl.
"But I'm confident that someone will find himself." He does not want to compete because he has his residence in Bad TÃ¶lz.
The new chairman should be a tungsten house.
The TÃ¶lzer wants to work on the project "but very much likes to continue."
The different positions on reconstruction are likely to remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He honoured Dimbath as "Missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Through a high participation of the population as well as by voluntary helpers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "Also I was skeptical at the beginning.
But in the course of time, I have become more and more convinced that it is sensible to move forward the project. It could be created a "all-configuration feature" for the fleet city.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be fundable through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believes Piffl.
"I don't want to just throw the idea of reconstruction overboard personally." He hopes that the Burgverein may move something on this point.
Their goal of documenting the history first is "is important and good".
After that, you could continue to see.
Clever ways to save on university learning books
Since the cost of university teaching books for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder considered a smart saving idea.
He invented a leaning system for students' books of higher semesters and offered a nominal compensation to delay sales.
"My mathematics book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-A-cook," said Schroeder, 19 who visited Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The College Board informed that students spend more than $200 per year on teaching books and study material, but that there are different cost-sensitive options for students.
Online shops and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of the choice for the students.
Renting teaching books becomes more popular, so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying.
Nobo Inc, which operates more than 250 university books, informed that the renting of textbooks has doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books were rented in the college book shops last spring semester, said Neebos Vice President Tevor Meyer.
Less than half of all teaching books are purchased, according to the Trade Association National of College Stores in Campus books.
Here's the single one for the best deales.
Buy online
Some new books cost online only one third of the price for which they are available in the campus book shop.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" vno Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be obtained from the specialized teaching book retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy Used
If your notes do not matter to any other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduating student at Brigham Young University, says that he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold new for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls recommended that students ask their professors whether previous expenditure is allowed.
Sometimes the updates for the seminar work are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenditure can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com from eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rental
Renting teaching books is worth considering if you treat them somewhat well, remember giving them back and do not want to keep the books after finishing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Inform on the terms of the business where you rent, including the penalties that may apply to the writing of notes, underscores or signs of use.
Renters: If you do not return the book, the penal fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional teaching books are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc..
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best offers, as many classics can be downloaded free of charge today, while scientific and engineering books can be very expensive.
Surely look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon visit the Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for the price determination for books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before an online order, you should check if the book is actually available.
He learned this lesson on the hard tour.
He bought a book that had four weeks delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college book shop.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a casser
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone played less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the USA, while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only recorded $12 million of his budget of $70 million.
The film "Sex Tape" tailored to Cameron Diaz was only 14,6 million dollars at the opening week, while children's films such as "DrachenzzÃ¤men" made light 2 too disappointed the revenues.
An article by the Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films could be the reason for the children's films themselves.
In 2014, Collin referred to as "the worst year" for children's films and described "Drachenzems made light" 2 as pure "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, in films for a slightly older target group it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic evaluation for each summer film launch, which was shown between the American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year to at least 2000 linen walls.
The results are based on the opinions of cinema visitors and film critics and indicate that this year's film hits are equal to that of the previous year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing vision habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Regisseur Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's jungle book film, said to the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think the times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
Unlike the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently achieved sales with streaming content of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to $837 million.
In the last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios that they concentrated too much on comics films and prophesied a "core melt" Hollywoods.
In the light of the current deterioration, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy could quite contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hits to be expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline of the cash results as simple "cyclical" and said to Hollywood Reporter: "The next summer will be the largest summer at the cinema cinema at all, and no one will worry about the business anymore."
A few years ago, when the second table tennis district class was deleted for the penalization of the lignage division, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Tischtennisbund has taken an additional 3rd Bundesliga into the program.
The result: Whoever didn't get up has gone.
For example, although GÃ¶ttingen's highest class team in the Oberliga relegation has avoided the descent, the next season only plays a fifth class.
Fourth-class Torpedos women remain in the regional liga, despite their grand march.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony liga, as well as the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo Reserve are found in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga no longer representing GÃ¶ttinger Klubs.
With the women, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the Torpedo division in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district headliga south.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB LÃ¶dingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Upper SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and TTC occur.
In the district liga, Dransfeld and the SC Weende play in the district class of TTC II, Red and White, the Upper SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district supervisor of women begins at least in silence.
GÃ¼ntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here with the party.
Start in the district liga Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen.
With the nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district liga.
The district liga branch of the SCW youths - there is still opening Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Upper SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two GÃ¶ttinger Kreisligen starts with the nine teams.
In the West Stock are the Red White II, the Upper SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the east-staffel, Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The women's cruise liga consists of Sattenhausen/WÃ¶llmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo vein and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at circle level.
It is noted that none of the six second classes of pilot strength will have to think of the innovative and repulsive circuit board once.
Nato summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests of opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people met in Cardiff in front of the city hall to hold a so-called countertop.
Stephen Fairclough has followed the developments for us on the weekend and spoke with demonstrators traveling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWEY young bush hikers were secured with the rope winds after they were caught the night in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girls and the 19-year-old man broke up in Govetts Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday afternoon.
Careful relatives called the police at about 20 a.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search troop from local police and rescue services broke up and the couple was found at about 23 a.m. near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had hurt at the knees and the man was crashed and had hit his head.
Rescue forces stayed at the couple overnight, and they were flew out on Monday morning.
They were delivered to the Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable state with an ambulance.
Escalate government enemy protests in Pakistan
The around 1000 demonstrators were forced by soldiers from the PTV building, said the Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The transmitter resumed the radiation after well half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said that the demonstrators equipped with sticks would have damaged devices in the editorial.
Dead or injured persons have not been reported.
The demonstrators demand the resignation of the head of government to whom they accuse election fraud.
The police notified that about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif it was again coming to collapse by around 3,000 demonstrators with security forces on Monday.
According to hospital records, a police officer was injured.
In the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 were injured when demonstrators tried to penetrate Sharif's residence.
They call for the withdrawal of the Prime Minister.
On Sunday evening after a meeting in the army headquarters, the powerful military called for a political solution to the conflict "without waste and apply without violence".
The Communication also stated: "The army remains obliged to ensure the security of the state."
The escalating violence has caused anxiety about a military intervention that has been more frequent in the past.
The protests led by the opposition politician Imran Khan and the preacher Tahirul Qadri have lasted since the day of independence on 14 August.
Sharif refuses to withdraw.
Khan and Qadri had called their followers on Sunday to endure.
"We will not go back without forced Sharif to resign," said Khan.
Qadri expressed himself similarly.
Khan proposes Sharif to have won the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri calls for the withdrawal of central and provincial governments.
A transitional government will then reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are employed to protect the government district.
At first, the demonstrators had persisted peacefully before Parliament until Khan and Qadri called them on the weekend to penetrate Sharif's residence.
HÃ¼tteldorfer after second season win on place three of the table.
With the 2:0 about Greed, a bitter week for Rapid ended a comprehensible end on Sunday.
"The victory is very liberating," said Trainer Zoran Barisic, whose team with the out in the Europe League had reached an intermediate depth on Thursday.
"The success experience was extremely important," confirmed Captain and TorschÃ¼tze Steffen Hofmann, who met with green-white at the third place.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid on SiegerstraÃŸe Rapid has demonstrated the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second seasonal victory and goes to the country game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who, with his magnificent leadership fully of the sixteenth row in the 14th minute, set the way to victory.
"I thought I would go all the frust from Thursday and snatch it under the late," said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had hit last time in a Bundesligaparty on November 13, 2010, that was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in Rapid dress will therefore remain in special memory.
"For me this is something very special, I'm out of the Rapid offspring," said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term cup blessure, scramble went from the left to the right side and made his business very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position mirrored.
He deserved the gate, he has done some assistants this day," commended Barisic.
Mannschaft shows character scramble also delivered the flank at 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally made the decision.
Because the guests could've been able to write to that.
"Thanks to God we have had some happiness today," also noted Schrammel, who thus played on the collapse of performance and result in the past weeks: "The results have not voted, but the player was always good compared to the last year."
Barisic even found that one had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that played this season in this stadium".
The first three-pointer since July 26, therefore, has proven that the team structure is intact to the relapse despite: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him not less delightful: "That we have finally played again to zero".
A lot of work during the country break Also the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schempelsberger have several failures to complain, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger have given their startel debuts, make the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget this," said Barisic, who lost in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have recently been very stable."
The country break must therefore be used to "leak wounds and put a bit in the physical area," said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his series.
One to which the break may be particularly located is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks up for the team, passes over pain.
Just in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic noted.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his change in the 68st minute not only the structure, but also achieved the second gate.
For the 33-year-old who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit from the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 via the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We certainly also had a little luck, but at some point luck must come back to us.
Now it was the highest time," said Hofmann.
He naturally urged to concentrate on further work: "You must not always see this black and white.
We haven't played as bad in the last few weeks as it has been presented.
But we shouldn't believe that everything is good now.
He couldn't argue the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team I can help very much at the moment.
In some stages, they are sticking to me," said Hofmann.
GrÃ¶dig-Coach Michael Baur had little to pretend himself and his team.
He regretted the fast counterpart "from the category Zaubertor", as well as the regular gate of benefit in the 40th minute, which was wrongly recognized by arbitration judge colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we weren't concrete enough towards the gate in some phases.
We had too little conclusions.
Indoor defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found pure and even made a gate.
Overall, there would have been more in it.
Under this whip, Ruh reigns
We showed a powerful tribe in our mystery of the summer series "My piece of RhÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still in the district, the picture is the "bigs" above under-white bruns.
A holpriger footpath leads up to the approximately 600 years old oak.
It passes by groups, basalt stones and basalt stone lakes.
A piece below the stone break from Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, stands there.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it stretches beyond the other trees of the surrounding area and reminds with a size of over eight meters to an American mammut tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stomp suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only evidence of the history of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted Bishopsheimer's archive and asked older people from under-white brunn to find out what relationship it has with the buddies.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, up to about 80 years ago, the goathirds have driven their animals from underwhite brown to the moistly redd and freed from stones.
At the foot of the tree, the animal guards exhausted from the ascension should have rested.
Meanwhile, the area has recovered its importance, because on the meadows actually weigh back goat flocks.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has further found out.
But when entering the stone collections, you should be careful, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for crosscoaters.
A hiking path leads from underwhite brown to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other routes are described, the direction of high-rising hens and invites you to an extensive hike.
Where's the waterburg?
However, a waterburg, which is sought at our next task, is rather rare in the height.
The reflection in the grave already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district where the building can fit.
Where is our "StÃ¼ck of RhÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck"?
My StÃ¼ck RhÃ¶ner GlÃ¼ck

After a week's diving, Italy's Prime Minister and President-in-Office of the EU, Matteo Renzi, held the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as Chief of EU Foreign Policy against strong conservative resistance at the EU Special Summit last week, she becomes successor to the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers how the governmental daily La Repubblica reflects the calling for Mogherini as a favorite in the government team as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and its own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his "reform package" in Italy.
Not least, Renzi hopes that the constant left-wing party base will be calmed, because Mogherini is assigned to this â€“ though rather moderately.
Against the Conservative Representatives with President Jean-Claude Juncker and the President-in-Office of Poland Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome is to make a political compensation.
For the EU's headdiplomatin is at the same time becoming alternate by the President of the Commission Juncker.
The remaining consent of the EU Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would have barely called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) a "important recognition" of the role of Italy in the EU.
La Repubblica widespreads optimism that for almost two decades, Mogherini, who has been proven in leading party offices and known for her ambition, will show itself the "estandard challenges".
The born Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began the PhD in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-democrats), which joined Margherita in 2008 with the Catholic Central Party.
In 1999 Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists).
With the election in 2001 to the Left-Democrats Party Council, she entered the high party policy, working in the Foreign Policy Department, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, was known by studies on NATO use in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop quota, the contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the USA.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Defence and European and International Affairs since 2008.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he called Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If today the PD has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the over 40 percent votes of the party at the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini has a share in it, as stated in PD tours.
The reservations in Brussels, the new EU external representative has too little diplomatic experience, so it lacks substance, is colonized in the PD.
In Brussels, in particular by Poland and the Baltic members, there is a delusion of realistic Mogherini's accent on the crisis in Ukraine and is dispersed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is intended to transport Russian natural gas directly to South Europe under the circumference of Ukraine, which also serves the energy protection of Italy.
After Renzi entered his term of office as EU Chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first national visit.
Photos that they showed with Putin at Shake hand were embarrassed in Brussels, as well as invited the Kreml Chief for October to be an e-mailing economic summit.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
This includes an Azubi who has previously completed another training in the company.
The new staff will be active in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and procedural mechanisms (two).
All Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas BÃ¼cherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg form forest, Felix Domaier from Oberveechtach, Daniel worry-free and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees had previously attended primary or middle schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all years as well as the trainers go to a team training event to Oberammergau, where, among other things, an all-day hiking and rafting on the Inn is on the program.
The company counts 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 employees worldwide.
The number of trainees distributed over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "hold the mouth and put France straight," said Francois Hollande's most important allies.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided links to show "their love" for the controversial Socialist President, whose cabinet conversion has been misapproved by the large majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay on his side," he said with great applause.
As a satisfactory gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for a loosening of the rules of Emmanuel Macrons, the new economic ministers.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show themselves "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, scattered sand into the drive, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate Socialist Member and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far right-standing leader of the National Front, ridiculed the continuing tomb fights of the socialists and said that she could not imagine that the new Valls government would last for a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothing, but Prince Manuel Valls has no one, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new will not survive the autumn or winter," said Miss Le Pen to supporters.
She repeated the reputation of her party after a resolution of the Parliament and said that she was confident that she would be winning as a winner in favour of preferential elections and would be ready for government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat at the local elections in March and the judicial national front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche revealed that 76 percent of the French believe that the Socialist Party is exposed to the risk of breaking into several rival groups before the end of Hollandâ€™s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not aim to improve the economy and record unemployment.
"There is a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must feel quickly that things change," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could further deteriorate.
Norwegian Cruise shortly before a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise provider in the world, has, according to experts in the industry, conducted advanced negotiations for the acquisition of the competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion.
A deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruises ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy expedition while there are competitors with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CRL.N).
A agreement could already be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday and warned that the conversations could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the Private Equity Society Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a share of 20 percent in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a speaker for Apollo rejected a comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company in Miami operates 13 cruises on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.

Prestige Cruises, also located in Miami, operates under the brand name Oceania and Regent, who jointly operate eight cross-ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues of 1.2 billion dollars for 2013, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry totals about $29 billion and in the next few years it is expected for them because of strengthening the middle class in emerging countries such as China and India.

Pro-Hongkong activists condemn China on the day following the election decision.
A peking-faith group swinged close to the Chinese flag.
On Sunday the Standing Committee of the National Congress adopted a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the management election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee which is expected to be occupied with peking-faith members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to be allowed to vote and prompted pro-democracy activists to observe their threat and lamely the financial yard of Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong, and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy extends to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper, which presented China's domination over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum to the election procedure in the special administrative region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in.
Li's survey is organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Permanent Committee of Law, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Office of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be asked over the course of the day.
Student activists announced to gather in the afternoon before the headquarters office in Hong Kong.
United Kingdom did not provide any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin demands Kiev to take "state talks" with the eastern Ukrainian
According to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Russian media reports demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government fight against the separatists in the eastern part of the country and start immediately with negotiations on the "state" of the apostate region.
His spokesman Dimitri Peskow later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the eastern Ukrainian territory under the control of the separatists would become a part of Russia, but that its status towards Ukraine had to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call to the Kiewer Government to negotiate at a high level with the pro-Russian opponents, however, is in line with the strategy that he has apparently pursued since the start of the outbreaks five months ago: help for the separatists in conquering areas and pressure on the Ukrainian government in order to enable the newly proclaimed region Novorossija factual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with the State TV channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to conquer the areas held by separatists in the eastern Donezk and Luhansk region, which were taken in March and April after Moscow had anchored the Ukrainian peninsula of Crime on March 18.
The Kremlin and the Separatists have recently referred to the territory taken as "Novorossija" or "Neurussland", a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary glossary time of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope to attack peace talks in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for elections on the 26th Oct and while government groups of civil communities in the areas held by separatists, "have been caught in their illusions," reported Itar-Tass.
"We need to start extensive discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of the Southeast Ukraine in order to preserve the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's reference to state in the context of the larger autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months to spread fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, said Peskow.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, said Peskow, "because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the Kremlin Speaker to correct the "Fehlination" of Putin's Remarks underlined the leadership claim of Russia in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East, unlike the direct announcement of the Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much greater difficulties in joining the Donezk and Luhansk regions in the eastern Ukrainian, since most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and surveys from the time before the conflict gave a wide majority for the remainder in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats at international forums would give the regional governments in Ukraine power to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, giving the Kreml de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state territory with the Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important trading port and historical coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and the Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and molding plants that produce important components for the Russian military.
On 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislation - following new elections - should be taken into account in addition to the Constitution, with which the respective regions are given greater control of their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arms and sparkling Moscow are being cast.
Putin's last call for Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders at eye height followed another penetration of the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks penetrated across the previously peaceful region along the Asovian Sea into the eastern Ukrainian.
The separatists supported by Russia took over in the battle, which, according to fears of Ukrainian security officers, is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to the Crimea, the control of Nowoasovsk.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been made to fortify Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Nowoasovsk and narrow access to the peninsula of Crimea.
Poroshenko spoke on Saturday at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels and asked for deeds to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We're just in front of a point where there's no back," warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now located on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU Summit did not decide to take concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia to enter into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk, after two Russian tank colons and 1,000 soldiers last week entered the Donezk region to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first probably 63 Ukrainian soldiers included by the Russian invasion in Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday against 10 Russian parachute hunters who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, informed Lysenko on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal around Australian promis and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Sweetheart did not make a throat about his anger over hackers who probably stole naked images of his fiancÃ©e Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who the A promise from Hollywood.
The film town is excited after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence have appeared in a hacking candal to promis on the Internet.
The Hacker responsible for this is probably equipped with 60 naked photos from Lawrence, Star from "the tributes of Panem" and Superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
From Australian actress Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were said to be public due to an iCloud gap.
The list contains 101 promises.
Noblest who had engaged with Grecko last month said to Confidential, "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
According to a news site, Grecko, currently in New York, said that the hack was "shameful" and that the affected people felt "injured".
The hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-girlfriend Scott Speedman, including two recordings in which she is located above without a pool.
The Palmers film works include "Liebe is invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck Star Strahovski and the actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments about the hacked pictures.
A representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's a terrible violation of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his Tweet: "To post hacked images from a cell phone is nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
The spread of stolen images should not be tolerated purely legally.
Radler, Jogger and hikers attended the 8th cycling on the Great Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association "Help for Crew Kids".
The tour, which was a torture for one, was a light training for the others.
In one, however, all agreed: It was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For for the first time in his life, the boss of the Oberurseler Brauhaus traveled yesterday with the bike on the field mountain.
For good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle cater there, especially as attendance on the 8th wheels on the Great Feldberg for the "Help for Crew Kids" Association (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him valuable knowledge.
A great thing.
"I know now I can do that - fine!"
Small breaking on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits in the Oberurseler Stadtparlament for the CDU, many of the 718 participants were tormented to mountains yesterday in the early dawn and came near the exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
On the other hand, it was easier for others to overcome the well-eleven kilometres long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
For example, Norman DieÃŸner.
The Green Politician from the Circular Day - Red Dress, Red Bike - made a little more on understatement at the start ("Every amount of professionals, there's the destination!"), but then was half a professional at the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, press speaker of Oberursel City, who had made his way along with Frank GrÃ¼neisen.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg-Radles" was not necessarily a sporty challenge: "There is Charity, there we are happy with - we would have made an exit today," Kuhn said.
On the way they met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) went down to Oberursel in the morning to strike back to the height.
The Frankfurt Florian Zierz had swung home in the saddle in the morning at 9:00, "made" the Feldberg twice to roll home with fun.
Fun had also "Fritten-Toni".
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosks, bike tours via the Feldberg are simply included.
He had hit his 6.5 kilo wheel for 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The trained Mainzer says that he is an ambitious racer.
He must also be, because he was on his way with the "fixie wheel", which are also racing bikes, but without switching...
Not only did the 20 hikers, who rose up over the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger who took a car tying with weights on a cord.
Bergwacht-Arzt Professor Volker Lischke, equipped with his team with Allrad-Bully and Quad, said: "I know" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sleeve trail, just that he can pull the sleeve himself". The man is therefore in a way his own sleeve dog.
The 718 participants - and thus as many as never before - were sent to the route in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 p.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10:00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the Association "Radles on the Great Feldberg", gave the launch commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to lock the route up to the fieldberg to the safety of the participants.
