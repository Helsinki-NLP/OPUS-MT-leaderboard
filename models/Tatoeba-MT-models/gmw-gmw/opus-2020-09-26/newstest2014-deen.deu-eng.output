Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: On Tuesday, the new B 33 footsteps at the village park were launched in Gutach - in the view of the older town hall.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or shield bourgeois?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's Mayor yesterday.
"The town hall was installed at that time because it secures the school path," explained Eckert yesterday.
The Kluser Ampel ensure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially operated yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossing area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian arrival, another traffic traffic traffic and pedestrians had to come to their safety," said Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"With current measurements on B 33, about 12 000 vehicles per day, the municipality of Gutach, about 10 percent of which are heavy load transport," stresses Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffick is more than necessary: "Security is just happening here," says Arnold.
In total, four traffic tours had been carried out, also a circular transport was planned, but the narrow in the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße crossed again.
According to Arnold, at the location selection of the Ampelmasten, everything was tested before: "We have spent the means of an extra for us with particularly long wooden trunks loaded by transporters, whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knicking the ampelmass."
The approximately 15 000 euro expensive ample system itself is the "modernest thing on the market," explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that light so strong that the lights of the car drivers can be seen well, for example, also in deep sunshine.
And it is also sparing: the older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: this is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian press the ample button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the street is free, it comes directly green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people are going across the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone will be safely across the road," said Arnold.
Of course, the driver has to think here as a partner and observe the motorway.
This wasn't the case yesterday: hardly showed the traffick for pedestrians green, rising through a top-class vehicle - with bright red.
Joseph Winkler has been writing the need for his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the lack of language, the slope to raw violence and stupid sexuality, the narrow and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prizeträger is known especially as a prosa author, theater lyrics are rare in his work.
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Weatherlights on the Zungenspitze", which can now be seen in the Garage X at the Petersplatz, which is why a collage of prosatexts.
The theatremaker combines, for example, elements from the autobiographical novel "The Body Owner" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family delighting" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important requisite: a crushed sofa, on which an inevitably copied and masturbated is - the eight-head ensemble hangs through the text material.
It seems that director Fresacher has little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance transmits the template with a full range of directorial incidents, known from the repertoire of postdramatic game forms.
Especially the actresses come with the somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are tightly touched, with their head under water, tacted with their evening robes on the wall.
Incited in cellophan or fever, they stake on dangerously high sticks through the scenery, either monologize loudly or lie completely damped on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly transmitted in this effort.
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folkful songs.
Only to the end comes the overturned performance something to rest, and Winklers afterwards absurd humor flashes up.
A blackbox in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a money source to repair the decaying highway system, and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that takes place in each car’s armature board.
The devices that record each kilometre driven and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt from Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the outdated system for the financing of US roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly launched an intensive debate with colorful alliances.
Libertaires have joined environmental groups and argued that the government can use the small boxes for recording the kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information for calculating tax modes.
The Tea Party is disgusted.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while you cannot agree on a approach at the Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently checking how they can change to a system over the next ten years, where drivers pay for a mile per driving mile.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of whom are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
"It is nothing that we may only use," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans a record of the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there for that.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes, is pleading to the US Americans on the pillar.
But in America no longer is done as much as before.
Cars consume less petrol.
The state of mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocent per liter) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even in order to raise a cent at high spray prices.
"The petrol tax is simply not capable of future," said Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a miles-based payment system.
"This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term," he said.
Office crates describe it as a miles-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is sounded by urban liberals, for for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that waste and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The Californic Planners set up the system in the preparation of strategies aimed at achieving the ambitious, legally anchored climate change objectives of the state.
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also explained that he sees in it the most common long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of allowing drivers to pay after deferred route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Directives at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who in a report in 2011 had asked the Congress to move towards miles-based accounting.
The US Senate approved last year a 90 million dollars expensive pilot project, which would have included 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the incident and thus responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas representing people who often have to relocate many miles in everyday life on their way to work or to the city.
Several states and large cities move in this direction, however, at their own footsteps.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the miles to the state instead of the oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such a thing.
Illinois test it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, among which the transport ministeries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) are currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptically thinking that the government could follow any of their movements.
"Remembering against Big Brother and such things was a major problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and result management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
People didn't want it.
When the test occurred, the ACLU of Nevada warned on her website: “It would be relatively easy to convert the drivers into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, scarce technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology, with which the state can capture the kilometres driven, but not exactly when and where.
That, according to Khan, would make the public more calm.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company has not originally arrived to help states in the taxation of drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to take foot in an emerging market for car insurance companies, where drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles.
However, the devices tested by it are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that are regularly uploaded by modem.
“The people are more willing to participate in it when their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes made major mistakes.
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any device at all and instead pay a flat fee on the basis of the average miles traveled by all the inhabitants of the state.
Other posts hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the equipment with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officers want to develop a tax-paying device that will also allow parking fees to be paid, insurance must be paid only for travelling kilometers and speed data collected from other vehicles in real-time, thanks to which drivers can avoid stumbling.
"Traders would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system", says a city planning document.
Some traffic planners, however, wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge deterioration manoeuvre.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials explained that the Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrott Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional one-one fee or an annual charge could be imposed on cars with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," explains Randy Rentschler, head of Commission legislation and public affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things.
Königsfeld: Little team beat itself wacker
The volunteer firearm handled its autumn main sample despite staff shortages with bravous.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate spring in the Burgberger Straße in his exercise acceptance.
There should have been a short closure when sawing.
Two people were injured by the burning and the smoking development, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two respirators of the Wehr made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead to the free.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also overwhelmed.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machinery for woodworking.
The first deletion attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via an overflow hydrogen in about 100 meters away.
Now three deletion attacks could be designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer went on to show in the exercise what can be done with little staff available.
In serious cases, support is given through the Kingsfeld daily use group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
At his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President of Landtag Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt of where the workers came from tomorrow.
In the support centre of Hochschwarzwald, he followed this important question together with the management directors of the professional schools as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the parent advisors.
"Bildung is an important location factor", underscored Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the funding centre, the circle gymnasium and the vocational training centre in the forest town.
He also praised family friendliness in the district.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in view, but also the phase of the demographic change to care for family care," Wolf explained.
In addition, he suggested that more and more employees cared for the care and care of their families.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden of employees can lead to a termination of the working relationship," said Wolf.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For whoever has already learned the benefits of the region during his studies, with its acquired knowledge and skills, is often maintained by the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," the President of the Landtag was convinced.
Only if sufficient training places were offered could also be covered by the needs of professionals.
In his opinion, the locality advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate proximity to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg to improve public transport.
"Let you continue to be persistent and make public transport better," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
Experienced with music a fun afternoon
For 15 years the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
Earlier, the older fellow citizens were occupied at the rest of the town.
This afternoon is now held in the nursing home of St. Josef.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was worst salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich were interviewed with common melodies.
The more than 100-year-old Natursteinmauer as the frontal demarcation of the old school court on the Kirchstraße is to be re-established on the restoration cost plan of the city of Bruinen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angle wall was built in the first work of the renovation of the front school court, for stabilization and static discharge of the more than a hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrade.
The further approach is to include Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation is to be made by experts, which will then be put on the table to the Council of the Community for the decision and defining of further action.
A decision on this is expected to take place in the next year.
After the rehabilitation, plastering and tree planting of the old school yard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, it is necessary to be refurbished as a follow-up measure, which refurbishs the necessary restrictive wall from ground to ground and put on new construction.
The historical, one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old school court to church road, is especially due to water and frost shades, as no drainage is present, need renovation and has a bowling ahead.
Deep cracks in individual stones indicate weather damage, but the wall is currently not threatened.
A stand-proof wall is prerequisite for one of the students using school court, which has been done by the current fixing work.
The school court was originally planned even in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure brought a shift.
An important word in the history of school walls, which has already been used for film recordings, will be spoken by the country's monument office.
If requirements come from this page, the city of Bruinmen hopes for grants from the monument guards.
The students of the Bräunling primary school, which are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula, can soon use the old school court.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has now joined the ongoing discussions about the future of the musical universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up the holistic training at the Stuttgart University of Music," said Özdemir the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classics are part of the jazz location in Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who is the favourite of a direct mandate at the Bundestagswahl on 22 September in Stuttgart.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganization of the five high schools of music in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the Jazz and Pop course of the Musikhochschule Stuttgart is to be moved to the Mannheim Musikhochschule.
US border: "Super tunnel" to drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the USA, explorers discovered and stopped a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail slides and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were then confiscated, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine.
The tunnel had not yet been used according to the data.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through the radar," said the prosecutor-General of the Southern California District, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a camphouse in San Diego, where this was discovered an end of the tunnel.
Duffy insured the drug bands: "If you continue building and trying to use such tunnels, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 000 people in Mexico have been killed in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the laborious equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The railway system was so equipped that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side is access in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to the authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters to the depth of the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeter width.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine-fund.
The third, a Mexican, was captured because of the confiscated marijuana.
All three are threatening as the highest penalty of life-long freedom withdrawal, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not by tunnel.
This shows the "despair" of the drug bands whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA Drug Fountain in San Diego.
They would do everything they could do to get to the USA.
No details were given to the arrested persons, at least one of them were mexicians, said it.
You have to expect imprisonment for up to ten years.
2014 will be Geisinger festival year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Returning to the first U.S. mention is getting closer.
When the year ends in eight weeks, the anniversary is on.
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned in 794 together.
In churches a certificate was made in which both places were mentioned.
On March 15, there is an official start for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be 1250 in July on a party weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a festival act, on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the church hall.
At this party weekend is also the church-house church celebration.
City music director Rudolf Barth wrote a commission composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed at three dates.
On 21 June, together with the Sundays of the Schwarzwaldverein, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and devoted in the anniversary year, the official date is last September weekend, on 27 and 28 September.
A new chronicle is also released at the Geisinger City Anniversary.
"There is to be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the rising of today, which consists of Geisingen, Church Houses, Leiferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today's hostage celebrates 2014 birthday, in 1974 today's space was carried out with the unions.
The new chronicle will then be presented in the new festival hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November.
In 2014, however, it is also another year with many jubilees.
Strohglonki's narcotics begins on 8 February with a customs evening on the occasion of her 60-year existence, the harmonie Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The Leuperdingen old plant is 40 years old, the Geising school has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen music club becomes 150 years old and celebrates it in the context of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gifting certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then courtyard.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly, additionally, the municipal reform is still 40 years.
Council takes tracking facilities into the visa
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be rebuilt in order to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils decided.
Schiltach has to take up EUR 220 000 for this.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal track next year.
In particular, there is a need to increase the safety of rail crossings - regularly, there are collisions of trains with other vehicles.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must take part in the costs with a third, the rest share rail and the covenant.
Schiltach's city master Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specialities of the Bah transition "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build a subscription at the height of the tunnel to the west of the rail glaze.
There could also be larger vehicles, for example those who transport long wood, in counter traffic without having to block the sleeve.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road at due time in order to ensure a smooth flow of transport.
This was discussed controversially in the municipal council, as some councils doubted the need for road dissemination: Thomas Kipp, with his statement, brought the critics' mood to the point: "Do we need to take so much money on our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted: The "Hirschen" railway crossing is regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partially transported through this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route on the haeberles bridge because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is locked, Haas argued.
As it is noted that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnel should be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transport significance for a longer period.
The councils agreed to investigate the cost of the planned spread of the road.
Despite the fact that the necessary support walls were built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards the railway road, where appropriate, for encounter traffic to approximately 5.5 metres.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway crossing in the gerbery could result in a completely different problem that affects access to the strongly rising "Geroltzhaus Weg".
The administration had investigated the reconstruction plans of the railway by the Breinlinger engineer office, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus Weg was then without further possibility.
The investigation concluded that it was not excluded that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being set up.
In turn, the city is responsible for this as a road load carrier.
Consequently, the conversion could cause liability disputes.
Since both the wooden output and the degradation worked in the current state of construction, the reconstruction of the rail crossing should not be agreed, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than that of the other rail crossings, because directly next to the stop point center, which is a good visibility connection.
Even trains from the main train station would have to be braked at this point so far that no collision could be worn.
Most of them refused to reconstruct this transit, since the city of Schiltach would have to "bade out" the problem with cars sitting in the seat, says the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work was completed.
The body considers the reconstructions of the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which cross-country agreements have already been reached with the railway.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to start in the next years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the race.
Remote worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
Whether there are at least some of them life, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should you search for gravitational waves?
Or rather investigate the origin of the cosmos?
Or do earth-like planets find out and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are just questioned by the controllers of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to make research a crucial step forward.
The budget for such "L missions" is approximately one billion euros.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were at debate, five of them have now come into the closer election.
Numerous bodies examine the proposals, follow the researchers.
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, the Esa has selected four major questions on which the missions of the 2007-initiated program "Cosmic Vision" should find answers.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and lives?
The exact processes of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the creation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this dark.
And if a star possesses planet, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, in 2017, the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched, with which 500 already known planetary systems are examined more accurately in our nearby environment.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could visualize earth-like planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres and thus search for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to provide information on the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system these processes can be investigated exemplaryly.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a M-class mission (the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe should start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely.
Of great interest for the researchers are also Jupiter and his moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
The Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme.
The "Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, she reaches Jupiter and is to examine the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The World Space offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united.
How did the universe come about and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the original bang.
In addition to the matter we know, from the stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter whose heavy force holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, through which they accelerate the expansion of space.
So far, the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first part of the original knife, nor what dark matter and dark energy exist.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved a M mission here, whose start is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe aims to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky, allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and darker energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chances for permission as a L mission, many experts say, "E-Lisa", has a demanding concept for proof of gravitational waves.
These include physicians' changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein had predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proved until this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides for a two or three probe detector, which is stationed in all.
He could also prove gravitational waves created by the original bone, in contrast to plants on earth, and thus provide new insights about the origin of the cosmos.
Four further proposals compete for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is intended to explore black holes, including "Icy Planets", another mission to the external planets of the Sun System, "prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is intended to detect and investigate earth-like planets.
There are already proposals on the sampling back transport from Mars, for the research of moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for sun physics.
Snowden willing to ‘cooperate’ with Germany as regards US surveillance
Edward Snowden, Whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and to express before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not give answers to their activities.
The German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received this asylum to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter by Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, this writes: “Although the result of my efforts proved to be positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a break of faithfulness and attempts to criminalize political expressions with a threat of crime, in which no defense is possible."
But to say the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden wrote that he was convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charge against him.
The charge raised by the U.S. Ministry of Justice includes spying and thiefing of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said to Time Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we find ways to make this possible."
The relations between the USA and Germany are stressed by the claims that the NSA had heard the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, Member of the parliamentary committee responsible for secrecy, said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness if this could be "without threatening him and completely ruining relations with the USA".
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the former NSA employee Snowden, if he leaves the country, he could not return to Russia.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs a assurance that he is "safe" there, says the MEP.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a “intensive and ongoing” persecution campaign that had dismissed him from his home.
However, it is touched by the global reaction to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world and high-level politicians, including in the United States, have described the revealing of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merits to the public.
In his letter, Snowden makes a offer of cooperation to the German authorities, "if the problems relating to the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for one piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or Limonade, even if the announcement was to read on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that one calculated $25 when the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travellers who only paid on the hike.
Frontier spokesman Kate O'Malley said that the fee of $100 was intended to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she said.
Airlines started demanding fees for the first and second baggage.
Passengers who tried to deal with them have therefore put as much as possible into the hand luggage, resulting in the fact that the luggage vessels above the seat are often overfilled.
Taxes are one way to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said that at the new fee, it's not really about earning money.
It is about the faithfulest customers of Frontier that would have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the section above the seat.
Passengers buying your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a baggage on the platform from Frontier free of charge, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable baggage.
O'Malley explained that the site of frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that the passengers were informed about the fee before they came to the hike.
The new hand baggage fee of frontier only enters into force in summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often shrink over baggage allowances and other fees, but airlines like to take back on it.
They argue that the transport of the luggage should cost money and pay passengers this service if they wished it.
Many at Wall Street consider the new luggage charges to be a sign of the airlines taking enough money to cover the costs of flight travel after years of loss.
Most of them, however, leave their fingers of fees for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first fee for hand baggage and later Allegiant Air, also a cheap flyer.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the Airline Adviser Jay Sorensen, who carefully pursues the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand baggage fee Spirit will bring $50 million per year.
Sorensen, who had previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, has recently flew with spirit and was curious what would expect him at the stroll if passengers were confronted with the unusual hand luggage fee of the company.
"The boarding process was one of the most smooth I have experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see teeth knees and hand-created discussions on the steep.
“The plane was full,” he said, “and boarding ran as smashed.”
Frontier follows Spirit also with the 2 dollars that are required for coffee, tea, limonad or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or juice should keep the whole dose and have coffee refilled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had shortly tried to demand money for refreshment drinks in 2008, but this reversed seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other large society had been pursued.
Frontiers Step to raise fees for hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline, is the latest initiative with which customers should be directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This incentives all companies to move passengers to the direct purchase with them instead of using an online travel agency.
However, frontier has been the most widest in this area.
In September, the company started to award only half so many flight miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight trip booked by a third party with a frontier over 1000 miles is therefore only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve exclusively when buying directly on the frontier site.
Frontier has a faithful customer strain at its seat in Denver, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
The revenue decreased by 9 percent and the flight capacity decreased nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group, Republic Airways Holdings Inc..
Republic has tried to control the finances of frontier as part of the company's sale.
Proverbs come from the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the evangelical church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the municipality house were "speaking words from the Bible" and "requirements from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, chairman of the church council, went into a lecture on the Bible proverbs after breakfast.
"Speaking words contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings," she said.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the significance.
She called proverbs such as: Be watchful of wood, as shoes fall from the eyes, throw an eye upon someone who is given to the Lord in sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
The speaker also advised her listeners several times about what proverb it was.
The medieval speeches were taken by the church community Christel Dehner: All good things are three, blue making, something shrouded.
She explained the meaning and origin of the speeches she called "bridges in the past".
A Tombola was released at the end.
The prices were covered on a table and were spared humorously before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the guests of the breakfast round, Roman Waizenegger was also mixed by mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for ignorants in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched on the Mecklenburgian lake plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as ignorants in the industry are to be qualified as specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"New is that the six-month courses end with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Working Agency.
The benefit is diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be trained by professionals who were increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency should not finance unemployment.
The Chamber of Industry and Trade in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project.
NSA explains that a 'internal error' and not hackers are debted to the crash of the website
The shady National Security Agency declared late Friday that an error had lame her public website for several hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not accessible for a few hours tonight, since an internal error occurred during an planned update,” the spy agency explained in an e-mail message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that is not for some users.
Previously, a NSA speaker had explained to ABC News that the sensible internal network of the Authority was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, says the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed that the NSA website had been lame with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate into the internal network of the target system.
The former supersecret NSA, whose nickname was No Such Agency (No such authority), is now in the light of the public and has been exposed to sharp criticism in the country and abroad after the revealing of its extensive monitoring programme in recent months – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the desillusioned former NSA employees Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy about the secret service fired initial speculations about the fact that the incident today is the result of targeted cyper surgery.
Lightly down the number of people without a job in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was better with 3.1 percent than last year and better than in September, "we had hoped more," says Monika Feld-Bauer, Deputy Head of Management of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen.
For many companies have so far responded to attitudes.
One reason for this is according to field builder: "We have hardly any professionals in crafts, healthcare and old care".
Annual times are also available for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry since September.
In mid-December the winter season begins there.

Profit losses in Bombardier after fall in delivery numbers and orders
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% reduction in net profit on Thursday after it was under pressure by declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway savings.
Bombardier, headquartered in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for his brand-new plane of the CSeries and did not provide any new information about whether the aircraft could enter commercial use in the next September in accordance with the ambitious schedule.
On the Jungle flight of the test aircraft a year and a half months ago, only three further launches have been followed, asking whether the test phase runs as planned.
The results remained behind the forecast and led to a course break of over eight percent in Toronto's stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its evaluation of 'experform' to 'sector' on Thursday in order to ensure that the share has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker delivery numbers have been expected in aeroplanes, we are clearly disappointed by the marginal development in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program goes ahead for the plane.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical compared to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew after months of delays for the first time in September.
However, mandatory orders for the CSeries with 177 moderate as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and wish to see whether the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new nozzle aircraft are applicable.
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
President Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The management also assured analysts and media on Thursday, the programme was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected," said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the standing time of the plane, ground tests and software updates were applied.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We have decided to take a first flight and then hang a period of revision, whatever we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second out of five test aircraft will probably start in the next weeks, the remaining shortly afterwards, said by the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether the first customer can operate a CSeries plane 12 months after the virgin flight.
Bombardier explained that it reviewed the planning for the operation (EIS) and will update it in the next months.
“The slow advances of the flight test – even if they seem to be in line with internal planning – strengthen our view that the initiation is moving to the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter at the end of September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share in the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Turnover decreased slightly and decreased from 4.1 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says that he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decline of 57 last year.
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
On September 30, the order stock in the air and space savings amounted to $32.9 billion and was therefore unchanged against December 31.
"In the field of air and space, the results were in the context of our requirements, but the low intake of order and market conditions as a whole were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Turnover in the air and space savings fell by 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this saving increased by almost 11 percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
On September 30, the order was 32.6 billion dollars and was therefore slightly increased compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the field of transport has been affected by settlement problems in some large contracts.
According to company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier share was down by 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was announced that the Google financial board Patrick Pichette will change to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shoots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday formit day (local time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport leadership informed Twitter about the short news service that the gun was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported the man was dead.

However, on CNN there were also several planes to be observed at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller US airlines.
The LAX airport of Los Angeles is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug forest against police investigation has to go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, distributed information to Subworld Size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependency could come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpooler Crown Court
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a large police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years of imprisonment.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about research on its activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine breeding.
The lawyer, who was "primary" by Criminalists, with the nickname "Bash" was arrested in 2011 in his house after the police had monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was with colleagues at a supper of the lawyer's chamber.
The investigations showed that thista regularly consumed class A drugs, after testing traces of cocaine were found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to obtain unauthorized information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
At the time, all four suspects were monitored by the police in a major investigation process for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependency could become public.
Today, thista, who works for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn, was found and sentenced guilty at Liverpooler Crown Court in two prosecution points after a three week procedure for disability of the justice.
He admitted to cocaine ownership in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigation officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage ton.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned with Ditta, who was at the soccer stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park during dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine messages were exchanged between them.
It became known before the court that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after having been discovered in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards in Tests of Class A drugs.
Thista was later arrested, but dismissed to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the suspect dealer because he was his client and claimed that her discussion was subject to the "prosecutor's secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and he was taken a hair sample.
During the police investigation, he said that he operated an office both in his private address and at the workplace and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
Before the court it became known that he had called for important actors in drug trafficking, from which he had previously represented some of them, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that one does not break the law."
Thista is accused of the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, since he has been too much involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer who cares for his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of those persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He opposed police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to carry out their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta therefore disguised his professional status.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Thista refused any misconduct and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but do that immediately."
After the hearing, however, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: “Herr Ditta has done the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine dependency led to a hopeless compromise and made him welcome to the motives of leading members of organised crime, who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Attorneys must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public.
Thista has lost this confidence and has tried to get behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a condemnation in three cases for the possession of cocaine and disability of justice, which underscores our determination to bring criminals to court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape from the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years of imprisonment after he had declared himself guilty of conspiracy to heroin, cocaine and cannabis trade.
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer client in the death cell in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of his 160-year-old existence, the Song Kranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "German Fair" of Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which the spectators enthusiastic in the spring of this year, the songkranz will enrich two religious services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of Franz Schubert's German Fair.
On Saturday, October 26th, this extraordinary trade fair will be heard from 19 at the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27th, from 10:15 p.m. in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Fair with the original title "Songs to celebrate the sacred sacrifice of the fair", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of the emergence.
The trade fair is listed within the framework of the service, as the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the leaf group of the music club Frrohsinn Tenenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Scepticism softens confidence
The 2015 Pfarrgemeinderaad elections will, for example, change fundamentals in the Haslach Seal Care Unit (SE).
There is then only a common parish council for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
There is no change in the Diocese's fundamental decisions, and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactoryly as possible.
In the course of the day it was particularly clear: the scepticism towards the New is mildly hesitating but looking at confidence.
From the imaginations and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish community council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the chief officials of the Seal Care Team reached.
Regional dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for seal care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
Afterwards, the SE Haslach as a church community will form a public law body that enters into the rights and obligations of the until now six individual church communities.
There will be only a common parish council and a Foundation Council in which the pastor force is represented.
In each parish, at least two elected members are to be represented, and in the six parishes, the so-called municipal teams are formed on site.
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future.
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed a significant need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected assets remain targeted in the parishes.
The liabilities, however, go over to the general community.
Especially with regard to the large investments planned, whose commitment to all the parishes was then made, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only invested in projects that could be handled by individual parishes alone," has Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint board for five parishes, Barbar Ritter, chairman of the Board in the Seal Care Unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made themselves the task of "one, stay five" in 2006, and they had to find that this is not so easy at all.
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorge Unit then answered the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the municipal teams.
The preparations will be concrete in further meetings and decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seal Care Unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf the electricity becomes more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to pay for higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the city's works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, a family of four members of Pfullendorf pays EUR 70 to 90 more costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC environment from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy will be re-established each year in October by the four operators of the large streamways.
These amounts of the additional costs resulting from the energy turn, which they can raise by means of a envelope over the electricity price.
The city works Pfullendorf form the last part in this chain.
In its forecasts, the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even assumed a higher levy, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're starting from an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, where the number will be more close to the 2 cents.
Handle on permanent red: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes an ample just doesn't grow green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond or the light sign is defective.
What are you supposed to do - riding with red?
If a data subject has waited long enough on a red ample and the crossing is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before a functional disorder of the ample is due.
However, whoever continues the ride despite red lights must be clear that he is fully blamed for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warn Becker and refer to a decision of the Oberlandgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the ample after about three minutes of lasting red and had to rely on a bizarre red light breach.
The ample was not defective, but a little later jumped on green.
A ban on driving remained spared him because of the particular situation - but not the fine.
Community Council welcomes solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts have not been known since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be booked as full success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
Andrea Rothmund explained that the administrative budget was more than EUR 7.6 million than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget also exceeds around EUR 1.8 million around one million.
In particular, the surplus is due to higher industrial tax revenue and to the Community share in income tax.
The assets budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the 1.5 million euros planned, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is essentially due to the higher inclusion from the administrative budget," said Rothmund.
As investments have been reduced than planned in the financial year 2012, the amount of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve could be increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of EUR 4.9 million now.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Redhmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of the sleeves," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the municipal councils clearly rejoiced in the good figures.
It may seem paradoxical, but these good figures could soon be expensive for the citizens.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to refrain from high rates in the past.
In turn, however, according to Gerster, subsidies have already been reduced from the country more often.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory pitches.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must provide certain lifts.
"We need to look at the issue of lifting rates, as investments that we would like to grant in the coming years will take place," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
At 60 years of age Hubert Wermter's history is at the men's singing club Cäcilia almost twice as long as that of herb festival, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing with the choir that is now more than a lovely choir still makes him great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his engagement and engagement he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Representative on behalf of the Cäcilien Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him a letter of honor - as the choir is also a church choir - by the Association and by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singer colleagues gave him the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraving tinnteller.
In addition to the honour, the 31st autumn festival took place in customary trains: With the MGV Betra, the song crown Salzstetten, the Baisingen singer department and the local music club, the full maringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and vocal styles, which were subjected to around 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with vocal songs such as "In the wine paradise" and "Happy, their brothers".
Their honourable singer Hubert Wermter prepared to honor a little town - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choir songs like "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, far away" from Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you walked through the valley".
With his mixed choir and his women's group - the "impulsor" - the women's ratio of the festival, the song crowned salt stitches.
The mixed choir abducted with the neopolitan people "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus in foreign countries, while the "impulsor" also relied on foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" belonged to their program.
The Baising Sports Association's singer division returned with "What's Is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" back to homeish fals, where the full maringer music club offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small adventure program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer launched a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children worked well over the afternoon.
Children's dreams become true
The children's gardens and children's day venues in the customs alpine circle have been posted in these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Black Forest Bote wants to support the facilities in achieving their construction and beauty wishes.
Does the children's garden need a new sandbox?
Participating in the action can include all children's gardens, children's daysplaces and children's crabs from the entire customs alpine circle.
If you have a design or beauty wish for your facility, you can apply with this at the Black Forest bot.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury consisting of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all entries.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be made with construction material at a maximum value of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many active builders.
What about the Day of Action and the Helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the children's garden on the agreed day and is to be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press resents on controversial media law
'We are in an alarming situation and we can ask ourselves, 'What does Parliament stop simply abolishing the judicial independence tomorrow', read the newspaper, which considers the draft law not constitutional.
"The law is draconic and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, who also belongs to CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya.
He said that the new media tribunal “will always be preset because it is an extended arm of government” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President is listening to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and to send back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government, through the new law 'the media effectively take into a hurry', writes The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of speech in Kenya, had suffered 'a severe blow' and called the draft 'draconic'.
The adoption of the law is one of a number of measures to strengthen national security in September following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media raised the wrath of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units sent to the crime site allegedly robbed the luxury shopping center.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative, even if the charge was withdrawn after a call from the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be occupied with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan Shillingen and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the ownership of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to Daily Nation, “a single penalty can push the majority of radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on those of its description according to 'living blogosphere' of Kenya.
If they breach the media to silence, politicians could do whatever they want to do without punishment.
“No one will ever experience it,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at the nation who calls the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
"There are politicians leaving themselves, bringing them into bankruptcy, and returning us to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
The Kenyan legislators have already moved public anger in the past.
In May, they agreed to reverse the reductions ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reimbursed their deft salaries of about 532,000 Shilling free of tax per month – they are among the world's highest.
Bad Dorrheim: A dream becomes true for the FC
The importance for the city and the football club did not give up the official inauguration for the artificial race sports square despite the cold weather and the rain.
A more pleasant holiday time would have been for everyone last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
So all those who came without umbrella or could not keep one for any reason.
This was done by the musicians who framed the festival act, as did some speakers.
For that reason, Nass also became the FC Chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks was to all of the previous mayor Walter Klumpp, who had committed himself to the implementation of the project, to the municipal council, to the companies and association members involved.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty pensioners shifted 400 square meters of plaster stones for the new paths.
This remarkable honourable commitment also honoured the Landtagsabgeordnete Karl Rombach.
Further greetings spoke for the City Sports Committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the Southern Bath Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the Planning Office, who announced a donation for the Youth Division of the Club.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that in spring and autumn, recurring weather-related influences added to the original lawn square in such a way that he could not be played.
15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem when the construction of a third place was planned at the ground of the football club or at the real school at the Salinensee.
Both of them were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up to build a artificial sports place, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were introduced two years ago when the FC took over the shaft in herbs, agreed a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and approved the country funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356 000 euros at the total cost of EUR 560 000, summarized Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meters large artificial grass square took place on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were deported, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike line.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with internal and judicial issues.
To this end, the responsible working group gathered in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it concerns direct democracy, taxation of MEPs and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the migration and integration group also wanted to continue their discussions.
This should include the issue of double citizenship, both sides of which have oppositional ideas.
The SPD wants to end the force for immigrant children born in Germany to decide for one – the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not at the meeting order on this Friday, the SPD supported her no to a car toll required by the CSU.
A Vignette is a "Flatrate for the Frequency and thus ecologically contra-productive," said the SPD negotiator for Transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threatened fall-off movements on roads that are already accidental issues.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be a first step from the perspective of Pronolds.
"There is a danger that at a later time the compensation for Germans will be deleted," he said.

Car drivers seriously injured in accidents
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on the outer ring on the Kempener in the direction of Grefrath by 21.15 p.m.

Vienna Airport purchases passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
This way, there will no longer be any more at Vienna-Swechat Airport.
Most of the loudspeakers fall away - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxing atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesperson Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting of doors that affect individuals.
Among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already refraining from the noise calls.
Due to the removal of these transmits - on average, about 200 personal calls by the loudspeakers on one day - it is expected to be more quiet at the airport in the future.
"The experience has also shown that these individual passages have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed flight climbs or departure times are a bit down here," said Kleemann in conversation with the radio station.
Highlander-Games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to braking cars with tractors, there is a second competition at the autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday 7 September, the Highlander-Games start at 13.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are sweaky in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and single fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree casting, coughing and water braking.
The tree strain is four and a half meters long and 25 to 30 kilograms heavy.
"It's not going to be far away," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The strain must be thrown off vertically, overlapping once and then just to lay down.
This is assessed by most points.
The target accuracy is due to the throat of coughing.
From eight meters distance it is thrown on a pluck.
The skill and strength of the participants must prove more than 50 meters in water irrigation.
Time and quantity of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "Clan" or team, two are then allowed to participate in the single competition.
The winners of the team and single competition receive prices.
Train can be trained already at 10:00.
A suitable clothing is required, for example, the competitors can take place in the rock of Scotland.
However, it is also allowed to wear in Schwäbisch.
For the "Outfit" the jury still gives some bonus points.
You can log in up to an hour before the competition starts.
With the Scottish-Swimb Highlander Games and the tractor-pulling, which begins half an hour earlier, on the festival ground on Saturday is already a lot of action.
In the evening the bubble music friends come at their expense.
At 9:00 a.m., the birabian bubble music from Schumberg is the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleet Polkas and fairy tale.

Specially for children there is a stringel zoo, straw hipburg, tractor riding (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the Skiclub and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Overview of milk and egg alternatives
Vegan diet requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Purified tofu with plant room, for example, is a quark rate.
The Vegetarian Federation also mentions the World vegan day on November 1st.
The Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a number of vegan alternatives on 1 November on the occasion of the Worldvegan day:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, leaves joghurt to replace with Sojajoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Preservable plant room replaces conventional tan.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half crushed, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of applemus or a dining spoon of ground linen seeds plus three dining spoons of water are suitable for it.
Clearer become dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a tea spoon of baking powder, a dining spoon of food strength and three dining spoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of Sojajoghurt or Seidentofu can also accomplish this purpose.
According to Vebu, some 800 000 people are currently feeding vegan in Germany, that is, purely planted.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American capital of New York.
After eight hours of flight, the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, was on foot.
There was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithfully the motto "The city doesn't sleep" was decided the day at Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Freedom was reached with a ferry and clammed on foot.
==References====External links==* Official website
On the third day the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373 meters high view platform of the Empire State Building.
Afterwards it went through the bustling of the New York streets through the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to stay short in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the school everyday at the Weymouth High School.
This year also, on the name of the Holy Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marie on the Hülsbergstraße, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the narrative of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting-horn blower group of the hunting riders Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth musicates on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood of Es) after old, originally French melody.
The blades wear riding clothes because they accompany primarily riders, horses and dog-husbands on snail hunting musically.
The solemn fair will take place on Sunday, November 3rd, at 11.30 p.m.
The newly designed cover shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to Lexikon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation once.
In the case of a visit to the same name café at the surcharge in the district town of Kleve in sight of the University of Rhein-Waal, it does not have to stay at the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, with the beautiful name, the café has exactly the goal: to make a real stay not only thoughtful, but to make it easy to live again and again.
Because it's just fun and it's just nice.
A look into the interior life at the strike 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The highly modern but not cool café ambiente looks like a place to feel well.
Here the team and founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoil the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually occupied fresh baguettes.
The holders, both 33 years old, have already made a name before opening the delicious café on the sale as a gastronomy: In Kranenburg they carried the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve at the summit, the sympathic café lover hopes more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"Why we don't have a specific target group," Daniel Büttner stresses.
Rather, the two young students here want to address the same as seniors and all age classes between them.
Apropos Café-Liebhaber.
The sympathetic holder pair is behind the coffee pleasure.
Enjoy the fragrant hot breeze in the most diverse variations themselves.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the Cappuccino drinker.
"There's a baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatz evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everybody's thing.
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is also not a pronounced fan of event evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event I always address only those who are also interested in the special event.
Therefore events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the whole normal operation as little as possible."
That means: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
Regarding the quality of the products offered here, as well as on the team and the beautiful environment at the cover in Kleve.
The road that develops more and more into a gastronomy miles.
For the joy of many clevers, the guests from nearby and far away and the students who discover the Gastromeiles and thus the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A day of thanks to the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club hall of the "Witteborg" restaurant in Dinker, all enjoyed harmonious interaction in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the appropriate festival to perform honors.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was pleased with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also turned some round for us, our heartfelt thanks for that," says the Chairman of Chorus Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir samples through activity strips this year went to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary president Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with each 42 participations.
Place five occupied Notenwart Artur Brückner.
A special thanksgiving pointed the board to the team of club manager Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets at its regular choir samples every day at 19.45 p.m. at the club place.
"New sanctuary voices are welcome to us at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new goals in combating poverty
The United Nations will immediately start drawing up a number of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals to combat poverty, which were announced 12 years ago.
In front of the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which started in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the launch of “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the evening at the summit that the time had come to 'think out of national interests'.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to tackle a process aimed at achieving universal sustainable development goals," he said.
“These objectives will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015.
I will not take any effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even though the SG Achim/Baden has been without victory for four games, there is still good mood with the handball superligists.
There's no doubt in that tractor Tomasz Malmon.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope we'll finally win again.
"For I don't even know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the third-liga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet poured out trees, Malmon in front of it warns the point finger.
Many players I have trained myself in the A youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
The SG-Coach explains that "there is to wait for strengthening from the first one."
In order to finally return to the success track, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous performances.
Before all things in the covering work and in the switch game, it finally hampered mighty.
The use of chances also needs to be better definitively.
So I hope that my players finally got their head free during the short break.
Security thinking in Mozambique grows in view of collisions between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique to agree to peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
It was fearful of the future of the country that she exchanged her business clothing against a T-shirt with the title "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's independence square on Thursday.
Since two weeks, there have been nearly daily reports of collisions between governmental forces and renamo, which have been among the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, initially supported by the White Government of Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in the effort to destabilize the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country is falling back into an adult conflict, but the recent events of foreign investors and locals have disturbed.
For the rapidly growing economy is much at stake, because the discovery of huge gas resources in front of the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investments of more than $50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA into the country in the next few years.
The ruling frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo blames each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government had provoked the recent collisions by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional highburg of Renamo.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government troops attacked Renamo support points and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, Renamo's spokesman to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the collisions and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about an instability.
Concerning AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a "loser" who "will use all his remaining forces to prove that he can force the government to make his decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
Against the FT he said that he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement.
"Our vision is to start negotiations again seriously," said Mazanga.
Earlier discussions between the parties have contributed little to the elimination of the tensions that have been fired by a number of collisions this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama), who collapse the heads," says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and Muslim expert.
None of them are well negotiated and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who urges election reforms, has already explained that it will boycottise the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as attempting to violate movements to achieve concessions and financial advantages by the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçamique (MDM) founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation stands on when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the President's office," says Mazanga.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has attacked unrestful attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection.
Most of the fights took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred miles north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, use the port, mining firms such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga replied reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique," said Mazanga.
Instability has increased the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, Head of Mediacope, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"The people think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrant, said that people just wanted stability.
"No interest in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as 'models for life', says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that “brutal force has no chance against clever tricks” and the artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are “very too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools”, so Crossley-Holland pleaded for a “careful selection” of old works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that in the case of authors and teachers who are "excessively didactic" children would be "completely dismissing" because in entertaining stories the messages would be "low".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Angel Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as possible."
The greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to give hope.
Not all needs to be simplified or lead to Happy End, but there is an immanent sense for good and evil.
This must be submerged, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing rather than telling.
Hansjakob moves again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took over his age retirement in Haslach, on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the very short-stay scene game.
From the arrival of the honourable citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakobdarsteller Alois Kraftzzyk had designed an entertaining piece, which had a lot of applause under Cornelia's directorate.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged times from youth to close retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob came home to his children's sky, into his free courtyard.
And then the scene game began in which Alois Krafczyk once more shone in his parade role as a great son of the city.
Stilheartedly, he performed with the two-speed and "Black Forest Foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also called him welcome.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly good to get into the role of the sister and gave her in Mimik and Gestik immense life.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played suitablely selected music pieces and thus finished the performance.
To award the honourable citizen's dignity Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honour that, in the representation of the then official owner Hättich together with a part of the city council, made his expectation.
Afterwards, the three king singers who caused Hansjakob to call out: "Ah, how beautiful, youth reminders will be alive again in my own three-coin period."
With her song "O Jesuin", they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storch Day's children with their loud "Heraus, Out".
His criticism of the Office Church at that time expressed Hansjakob as much as his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his grave chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A calm spirit had finally found his rest and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
There were a lot of applause and many praiseful words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar Giants grows
The opportunities for the league of the sporty Ludwigsburger Bundesliga Basketballers have risen.
Because there should be a wildcard procedure, then there is less a competitor for the Neckar Riesen now.
The Basketball project Hamburg Towers refuses to apply for a possible returning place.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has set up the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
However, a first breathing was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We didn't deal with the wildcard process, so long as Düsseldorf won't receive a license," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil in our newspaper.
Until 23 May, Aufstieger Düsseldorf Baskets can submit documents to the arbitration court and prove its economic advisability.
Until now, the Rhine countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitration court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Anniversary church goes into the glance

Snowden could also express in Russia
The former U.S. secret service expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US-speed company in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal General Prosecutor could either ask questions in writing or make personal contact with the 30-year-olds in Russia.
This reported to the Agency Interfax, calling on unnoticed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, it said.
A Snowdens trip from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the Agency quoted its source.
Because Germany was an alliest of the USA, Snowd dragged the delivery there, it continued to say it.
Long breath is paid
Six men's teams fought for the winner title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of the team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf to the tournament of local clubs and friends.

Sharp pipes disturb residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested strongly in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the neck.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard uses, among other things, wind plant logistics.
Black shimmers the stone coal on the warehouse in front of the pond.
Two huge blue hook and recharge equipment distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every movement of the envelope devices sounds a sharp warning noise over the ground.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, CEO of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavourable winds, this is far heard - and there were already some complaints of people from the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close agreement with the authorities, it is now possible to keep the warning signals with technical measures slower.
He also set up the open dialogue with the neighbours in the future.
For Matthias Schrell still has a lot of things in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to put on coal imports for power plants and is one of the majors in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18,5 meters deepened basin shape terminal, Capesize-Bulkcarrier can be manufactured here.
"This year we want to knock the 3 million tons brand at the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the countryside.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is going to the network, it is realistic that about 5 million tonnes of coal imports per year.
The three ship-loaders on the bridge and the second bridge could create up to 10 million.
Bayerns Basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague was not able to weaken the huge optimism in the basketballers of the FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe in winning even against the best team of Europe in the past two years," said Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic after the unhappy 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the title defender Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: Also in Munich there is Basketball!
During their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clarified enough in the decisive phases.
The guests initially created the piece of art to convert a 15-point reverse level 13 minutes before the end into a guided tour before Piräus gave the game again a turn.
"We have incrediblely fought back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made blurred mistakes," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful actors of Munich who had celebrated clear victory in the first two parties against the Italian Serial Master Montepschi Siena and the Polish titler Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up Comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago, the Varite artist Frank Fay, who worked as a Conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Fay's innovation has been expanded over the years, as it was recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival was launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year celebrates its ten-year anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headlines started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were known sometime to join a club," said Hirsch.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event there are events of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as of “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy beneficiary event for armies in the Madison Square Garden, which include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of the Comedy has also grown.
A number of Comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known over rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became acquainted with a Sitcom in the cable television (the Ironic-Blowing Fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has its own sketch show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the occupation in both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is the most famous for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young Comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, concentrated on racial topics) are products of the decentralized world of the American comedy.
Among the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he moderated a television program entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" at TV Land.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, he sometimes walks through the street between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, I might live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran shows itself a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN Veto powers and Germany satisfactory with the negotiation process.
"After years, one now has an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to eliminate the differences in the last years," wrote Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way, but the nuclear chief dealer is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end of the two sides there is a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game comrades with Machete
Two children have received the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 - and 12 - year - old boys had invited their victims to go with them on bird hunting.
They armed the 11-year-olds with machetes and knives on Tuesday and threw the body into a fountain, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played before their apartments in a working quarter of football.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As Alibi, a five - year - old half sister of the younger who had taken them was to express that she had been sexually attacked by the boy.
But when the girl described the Tathergang before the police without mention of an attack against her, the two boys admitted the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elderly called, among other things, a rivalry in football.
He was temporarily transferred to a psychiatric youth institution.
He's got to go to prison.
The Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years of imprisonment because of exploitation of human trafficking, surgery, threat, injuries and dangerous injuries.
The former German military soldier, who worked as a doorsteker after two operations in Afghanistan, made a confession within a process agreement.
Accordingly, he met women in five cases via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent against their will after a few weeks.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
The revenue of the women, who for some years bought for him, he kept.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he interrupts contacts of women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague who presented the women, he brought them to various boards in the southwest.
There he had partly monitored them to control their revenues.
Before the court, the defendant first claimed that he suffered from a serious trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had died next to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert pointed out great doubts about the mental constraint and thus of a limited debt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court had no more to hear any of the damaged women.
As a Kripo official reported, after a first notification by telephone monitoring measures, at least four other cases of utmost human trafficking could be identified.
The listened conversations were characterized by high aggression.
In later interviews the damaged would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another Witness, who had discovered blue spots throughout the body, had not made any statement to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality", which sees violence and exploitation in this meter as normal.
The defendant regretted his behaviour yesterday.
"He dissolved from these circles and wanted to live a very normal life after the detention," he said.
Oil price continues to be up to USD 96 per barrel
The oil price also dropped on Friday after anxiety about a high offer overshadowed a report that increased the energy-hung production sector of China.
The reference raw oil varieties for deliveries in December in Europe fell by 14 cents in the electronic trade at the New York Merchant Exchange to EUR 96.24 per barrel in late morning.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price deterioration of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of raw oil has burdened the prices over the past few weeks.
The United States Ministry of Energy stated on Wednesday that the US offer had increased by 4.1 million Barrel last week.
During five weeks, the offer increased by 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, there was evidence of increased demand by two reports on an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates continuing recovery in China's economy, whose growth increased to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after it had reached the lowest level for two decades in the previous quarter.
Raw oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international raw oil, which is also used by American refinery, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to EUR 108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on the stop-and-frisk directive of the NYPD
On Thursday, a Bundesberufungsgericht in the USA blocked the appointment of a judge who had requested changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("Anhalten and Browse") of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. appeal court stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Schondlin would be suspended until a decision had been made.
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way the program for the stopping and questioning of persons was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedies, including the decision to establish a supervisory body to assist the police in amending its Directive and the corresponding training programme.
On Tuesday the appeal court heard the arguments on the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be disfellowshipped from the case, since she had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by deciding that a judge should avoid the phenomenon of partyity; this was partially based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had responded publicly to the criticism of the court.
The judge had judged, police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, because they targeted inappropriately black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras carried on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out.
In August the city of New York declared ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control.
A oral hearing on the calling of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactics were criticized by a number of citizens' rights defenders.
This type of control has been in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the time of the partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of which black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men who belonged to all minorities were complaints that developed into a merger.
Advocates of amendments to the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police as well as influence the way other police presidents use the regulation.
Opponents believe that the changes would defeat the morality of the police, but not the crime; neither would money waste and the broader problem of a police who, after the defeat of the police, were under pressure for thousands of posts last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frist practice as constitutional, but only reform the type of implementation of the controls by the NYPD.
From the luck of dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that can only achieve dreaming camels
The first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the club "Healing Hands".
On Saturday afternoon the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already have significant successes.
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the talks pictures were shown by the inserts on a large canvas, so that guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the abovementioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former Federal Border Protection Vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and plans now, according to Henne, to work in advisory function at the association.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim in the record time of just a week, a miserable district on the edge of the capital - honorably.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be removed.
One learns a lot in Africa as a physician, says Henne, for example, dismantling against burn-out.
Due to the political disruption in the country, it was not possible to take as many travels as planned, but many medical professionals came to Germany to hospit in various areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, according to medical devices, medicines, association materials, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself supplied abundantly local coloration by telling from Mauritania of Mercedes vehicles rebuilt to the mobile goat stable and the experiences of the tribal musicians who traditionally support the club during their Mauritania journey.
As his personal motives, he called his work in the field of audit as a young MEP.
When he realized how much money was lost on his way, he decided to help the Africans in controlling a budget by the people.
In addition, moisture stressed that global economy also demands global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
It's not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
The former news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly used ‘telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation’ to try to confirm a false tip on an affair of Charles Clarke's former internal minister.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC explained to the court at Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's Voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called and left news as the court learned.
"In the opinion of the prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of the people's apartment and hopes to get them into a fresh deed, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said that NotW used three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the monitoring, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He disagrees this, but we say, "And whether he knew of it."
Gerüchte about an affair Clarkes was first taken up by the Emergency Redaction of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, it's with Charles."
A band with Voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
In the time the researchers ran, the grandparents received anonymous calls from Pawlby, where they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, the former Chefreporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a Voicemail with the following content: "I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles."
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the jury heard that Coulson Blunkett had faced a married woman because of an affair when he was lying himself with the co-catcher Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks argued that they had promised to hack telephones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
From protest against the planned empire tax, the French football will actually pass through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting will end without results.
In the conflict with the rich tax, the government and the professional football in France have manoeuvred into a sackgasse after a failed illumination meeting.
President François Hollande received on Thursday at the Paris Élysée Palace of Association and Association Representatives and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to save the football of the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country should pay for two years from 2014 onwards.
The opposite also remained hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be passed through, the chief association of the professional lubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, informed.
The days set between 29 November and 2 December in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are therefore overthrown.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the people in planning early," opened Mayor Jens Häußler the public information event on the floodwater protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Häußler made it clear: "The final decisions fell by the members of the municipal council."
The flooded water, which met Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was an inclined event that raised the question of future protection measures, said Häußler.
A river-area investigation had been commissioned with the neighboring community of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood-protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many lands as possible," said Häußler.
It is based on the planning of protection against a flooding every 100 years to be expected according to German weather service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15% increase.
This is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Häußler.
In order to protect HQ 100aClima, approximately four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality expecting national grants of about 70 percent.
However, haußlers pointed out that there is only support if a overall concept is implemented.
To this end, the community is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, the implementation could be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides local measures in the influx of the flow of Irm from the tribal valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants used the opportunity to submit their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and retention pools were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, designer of the commissioned engineer office Wald and Corbe from Hillsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it requires the interplay of all the measures proposed to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it is kept to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Cruelty existed in the old town's angers, who, even in the case of normal thunderstorm rains, have suffered again and again from overloading the channel network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for channel systems are different than for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events could be performed.
The dimension of the wastewater channels would swallow millions.
Heavily injured after collision
On the early Friday afternoon two drivers were seriously injured on the Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf during a frontal collision.
The police stopped the road immediately, but at first they could say little about the accident.
However, there are several witness statements that should be evaluated first.
The 19-year-old steering officer of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collapsed together, with the woman being stuck so hard that the firefighter needed nearly half an hour to free them from the wreck.
The actual cause of accident remained unclear at first.
Both accidents came in nearby hospitals.
The route was locked for about two hours.
It could be called the Dostojewski of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a God-seeker, a metaphysician, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Surprisingly the relationship in the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski, with his massive oeuvre, can be understood as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, you read Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite something in your own country.
Some titles have been published in the Heyne publisher, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two thousand ones.
Dick explains America - the empire of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security and faith to be elected.
Dick had God’s experiences, his late books read themselves like a mixture of John's revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He's been captivating, early, that the computers are Divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person differs from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Killing.
A Master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The minority report comes from 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, "pre-crime", that is what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world that looks like our frightening, mutants look into the future - and the police attack.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a crime of violence."
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, for that we have a criminal camp full of Pesudo criminals." They read time streams.
They assume that worm happens, and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the hearing noise of the NSA.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a division of violence, the military controls everyday life - and what is left by the state.
Then the guard itself is monitored and carried out a future crime.
The system runs through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own conditions.
Take mistakes and sacrifices not only for sale, but build up on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick reading means getting closer to the truth again and again.
Speeaffare for Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. secretary expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. championship about German Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German Federal Lawyer could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-olds personally in Russia, the Agency Interfax reported.
Previously, the Green Federal Minister Hans-Christian Ströbele had met as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affairs.
NSA explosions strengthen company paranoia as a result of state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deeply over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the instruction of the Federal Ministry for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism (BVT), the German internal secret service, he should photograph the roof of the US external post, less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a discussion between the USA and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reaffirmed in September that the US did not use foreign spionage options “to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
However, since Edward Snowden, the one-off employee who became whistleblower, has begun publishing his filling horn to U.S. supervisory secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can speak to the director.
Reports that the American National Security Agency is spying out the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has acquired data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, have brought the company paranoia to a new highest level because of state surveillance.
The fascination to pass brought the enthusiasm that Chancellor Angela Merkels had been pounding phone, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can get into the vision, it is certain that business leaders are also potential goals.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between US secret services and companies transparent.
I think it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up," explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the USA now posed nearly as much risk as China when it comes to industrial spying and data theft, such a survey published in July by the consultant company EY.
However, in the documents transmitted by Snowden, there was no evidence that the USA had passed the business secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Politicians expressed their concerns that the EU was lacking certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependency on the US.
The companies are skeptical in this regard.
In the Bundestag it was proposed that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"This is not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If one wanted to have a strong European IT industry, it should not have been extinct 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal over cars to agriculture.
Everything up to the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the range and technical refinement of the US spying authorities discovered by the Snowden explosions shocked companies that had previously seen the largest spy risk in China.
There is a major change in the cloud computing because European corporate leaders are now more aware that data stored in the USA are subject to the jurisdiction there and therefore potentially threatened.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, after the revealing of the US Data Mining Activities with Prism, about ten percent of the members not resident in the US rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director of SAP, says: "We see a new question of customers who have not existed a year ago – it is: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they remain physically in this room?"
Many German corporate leaders believe that the recent reports simply confirm what they knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be guarded at every price.
The fact that economic spying takes place is no surprise.
It's always been that way.
"It has been a subject for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the Chemicals Company BASF.
The Americans spy us out at commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
Business management usually does not sprout about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this brings advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been embraced that taking a free USB stick on a fair or unwaved lying a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, board member of Autohersteller Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain tangible to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access," the BVT warns in a report.
The USA warns its own companies against economic spying by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel, the US National Intelligence estimates were ranked at two of the countries that used to obtain economic data of hacking.
A board member of a German Blue-Chip company agreed when it comes to economic spying, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal secret service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very precisely that even when they work together in the fight against terrorism, all countries are spying out their allies.”
Hechingen: Fair answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important discovery trip that humans can make," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding party succeeded, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The Retro look has retained a way back.
That's what starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
On the front, the dresses with embroidery are often sliced and closed, often with a sleeve, but on the back they go down the back and often end in a sleeve.
However, since the ghosts divorce, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house clothing muller.
For men, the suit dominates with western and plastron, but it can also be selected cream-coloured or brown combinations.
Important is the selection of the local, it has been explained.
Jewelryless adjacent rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain pointed to its own offer in the Remise.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, you will have your link.
"But kids are also popular for boy's company's affairs," he says.
Romantics is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion, the "After-Wedding Photo" - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothing, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board, cakes and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable festival.
Dogfriends Successful
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dogfriend Bitz were successful on a Rally-Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his chicken Sandy, he achieved 94 points in the class beginners and secured the fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley, he brought it to place twelve with 87 points.
With her Woody in Class 1, Susi Höp stood the critical views of the performance judge.
Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teen, whose body was found in a rolled ringermat in his high school's gym, are convinced that her son was murdered, said the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on January 11th in an upright matte behind the tribune in the school hall.
The investigation officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but doubts the family of the 17-year-old.
"They are convinced that her son was murdered," explained Benjamin Crump, the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, to FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that it is not logical to violate the laws of physics as well as the health of human mind," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is twisted to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of her son.
"Your son went to school to learn and came back in the body bag," he commented.
U.S. attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation of Johnson's death because a number of important questions were still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which direction they go.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died of the consequences of a “position-related embroidery”.
However, a second autopsy gave another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there were sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil law investigation on the death of Johnson, he would charge the FBI with the execution of the investigations.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Authority was not ready to comment immediately on our request on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a court in South Georgia ordered that the authorities should release all the videos of surveillance that the investigators have checked.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped that the video recordings contained evidence of how he died.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for treating food allergies for children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children in school is increasing with food allergies.
One of 20 children in the United States now has food allergy.
According to CDC, the distribution of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools that will awaken awareness of food allergies in the teachers and employees and how children are to be treated to show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – to deal with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the state have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrin more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels like something pushing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue cribs".
Parents of inter-sexual children can choose 'generation indefinite'
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognized for children born with non-unclear genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigid male or female.
According to the new law, parents must no longer explain gender for such children, but can specify 'undetermined' or 'undefined' on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make overhaul decisions regarding operations for a sexual allocation of newborns and combat discrimination against inter-sexual people.
According to BBC years later, one intersexual person said: “I am neither man nor woman.”
I keep the flickwork created by doctors mutilated and scared.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children is not born every year as a boy or as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that is covered by the diagnosis “Sexual Difference Disorder” (DSD), a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (eersocks or hodens), or unusually developed genetals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States recommend that you use the best available information on sexual allocation if a provision is not possible and do not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide, if at all, for surgery.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “sickens according to a good thing”.
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention, but most children do not,” he said.
You could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data about how a child develops his sexual identity are not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that inter-sexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and statur, priority sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genetals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also presents an overview of discrimination which is subject to inter-sexual and transgender people in the workplace as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Non-mattered boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, in Australia and Nepal, adults have been able to indicate on official documents male, female or third sex.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the first 'genderless' person in the world after a court had admitted lifelong maintaining a 'undefined' status of sex.
In addition to M and W, German experts have a third assignment, X for intersexual, according to the Ministry of Intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender topics are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the "generation theory" should be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online website has also spoken against the German law, explaining: "If the world is distorted into a new state, where the sex represents a decision, but not sexual activity, then we distort two other pillars of civilization."
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that it would be better for babies to be assigned a gender at birth.
"The parental existence is already stressful enough without any further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your own child," she said to the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexes were called Hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Even ten years ago, the medicine viewed the sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilded.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, after now knowing how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when it grows up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’”, said Drescher.
When such a child was born, it was not called the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with non-unclear genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex was formable.
He emphasized the term "sexual identity" and argued, social and environmental offences – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and expressed whether a person was regarded as male or female.
But in a case known under the title "John/Joan" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a spoiled circumcision to cast the child and also remove his hods and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion, but what he was not", Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations came to the public, which are 'not happy with the result'.
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but dubious genitals.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and the Hoden were removed surgically shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I was not a girl," he said to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was to receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genetics.
After learning the truth, he changed to the male identity, received testosterone injections and let his breasts be removed.
The surgery has made him unfruitable.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Managing Director of the Advocates for Informed Choice, in California, ensures that the German law could “move to stamp and stigmatize”.
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make fast decisions and to assign a 'non-determined' to the child," she explained.
We are afraid that is favourable for intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
Yet, we do not know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that its organization supports the Australian law, because "it allows adult recognition as a third sex".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex," she said.
The German law concerns the assignment of birth.
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time.
When they are grown, they can decide themselves about their body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radioologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual disparity and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorized" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the recipe sequence of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no egg holes.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in the children's psychiatrie.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to be able to get a child through adoption or a mother.
"The law gives parents room so they do not have to make overhaul decisions," said Baratz.
It gives them the time to make various tests and clarify things and so gives them time before they write "manly" or "female".
In this way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent's happiness.
And you don't have to overhaul an operation that can no longer be reversed.
"This involves the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents perish because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides about the sex that fits better to him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injuries girl by shot from car
Unknown has injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in case of shots from a car.
The offenders had probably fired on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
It was told by the police in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left wall.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car who had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The offenders also shot on a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal police found it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were called only twice to be self-giving children who threw them against home facades.
Since the house owners recognized this in time and the egg residues were removed immediately, no damage would have been caused either.
In addition, some Sylvesteröller have probably also been burned in the city area, but also here there has not been any damage to the matter.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with clone paper and his radzier blends were discarded.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found all his radzierblends in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to work.
Living with Future Perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives dreamy.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes with public transport.
"Don't you hope you're afraid of spiders?" asked Waltraud Ries and pointed to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult that is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not a spider phobie, but the concern to no longer handle the many staircases to the house and in the apartment at age, she explains.
Additionally: Since a Meniskus operation, the mid-fifty-five-year-old has had to learn on his own body what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor.
Only recently was a book from her published on the theme 'Happy living in old age - Which form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what's not going at all at age' she starts to tell.
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, at mid-fifties, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all dealing with the theme 'Wohnen im Alter'.
Most of them dispose of it as long as it goes.
Old are always getting the others," she says smilely.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, think about it.
"Then it can be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for self-determined living at age.
"What kind of living form you choose is always an individual decision," she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for age.
Even those who could afford the age retirement seat in Tuscany or the Bretagne should always think that he could also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the country language, you can also unite in the Dolce Vita,' gives the specialist book author enthusiasts to consider.
Among their models are classical care models, alternative living forms or the often quoted pensioner WG.
At age everybody has his ticks and Macken
'For me, though, wouldn't be such a living community,' she says with an eye swindling.
Not at all as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
"At age, you just need his retreat rooms," says Ries.
However, the book author does not want to exclude the fact that an old-aged living community can still function.
This must be done differently from the classical student WG.
And sometimes one just wants his rest, she believes.
With this view, it is not alone in the state capital.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for so long' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of civil service life in the age of the capital.
Their service advises people about the topic "Become Elder".
That is why older people would often also buy inconvenience and restrictions just to stay in their usual environment, which is also the experience of the Foundation of Product Tests.
Today there are many opportunities to make the house or the apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all who are concerned with the old-time reconstruction of their home or apartment, first inform yourself thoroughly and not commission the first craftsmen.
Today there is also for the old-righteous reconstruction specialists.
Even in the rental apartment, this can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat elevation, the interior architect clarifies.
But not always can the existing apartment be redesigned and thus unacceptable, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a staircase lift inside the apartment, the road also paved with stairs to the doorway would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue looking until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she grays more than before the spider on her door.
United States wants to continue pursuing Snowden criminal law
The U.S. has not changed their attitude to former U.S. secret worker Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of unauthorized transmission of secret information.
So he had to make a criminal proceedings in the USA, said the spokesperson of the US Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Snowden's recent comments would not change anything.
Previously, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, the German Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the USA not to continue to threaten him with penalty.
Psaki stressed that in the case of Ströbele's statements, it is that of a parliamentary party rather than of a German government member.
Secret servicesthüller Edward Snowden is in principle ready for a discussion with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clarified.
This has been cleared by the former NSA employees sought by the United States in a not addressed letter published by the Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to Bundesregierung, Bundestag und Generalbundesanwalt.
The letter shall, after a translation spread by Ströbele, contain the following words:
To the Dependents
I was asked to write to you about your mass monitoring investigation.
I was named Edward Joseph Snowden and was formerly employed by a contractual or direct appointment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I became witness of systematic violations of the law of my government, which caused me from moral duty to act.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent hatred that forced me to leave my family and my home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum, which the Russian Federation grants me in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by resonance on my political action, both in the USA and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have assessed the revealings to a system of comprehensive monitoring that is not accountable to anyone as a public service.
These Spionage Exposures led to many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the formerly hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clearer, while the risks incurred have been considerably reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was proven positive, my government continues to treat Dissens as a breakthrough of faithfulness and strives to criminalize and accuse political opinions.
Nevertheless, the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will put this detrimental attitude.
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are tackled, I will be able to take part in the responsible information of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, especially in terms of the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriately and legally.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Children's garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor Michael Maier.
The former children's garden in the garden street has sold the community to a private person.
The Council approved the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "appropriate" price.
"The community is satisfied," said Maier.
The budget employed EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that wintermen have handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer have to come up for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking at the garden and clearing the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is pleased.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The music club Hammereisenbach offers a place concert on the terrace of the host house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the tactstock at 19.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The Chairman Manuela Honeck explains the pieces of music.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped successfully cope with the first musical hocket.
Report: Obama campaign devoted to replacing bids by Hillary Clinton
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama have in secret convinced that he will replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election struggle with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The enthusiasm is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann’s long expected work on the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times presents a copy of the next book and reported on Thursday evening that the top advisers of the president had carried out “abundant group sessions and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out if Obama’s deteriorating hope of re-establishment would be better if he let bid.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values to exchange the former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the President's closest advisers – including Daley, former leader of Obama, Jim Messina, and former manager of the White House, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
The 'Double Down' claims that Daley had been at the top of the efforts to exchange bids despite its 'sincere personal relationship' before finally decided against such a chesstogether, after the data showed that the Candidature of Clinton would not 'verify the chances of Obama'.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually thought to replace bids with Clinton.
"I expressed a number of things to be considered, and that was one of them," Daley explained to the magazine.
It must be remembered that the President at that time had terrible survey values, so we thought, "For God's will, what do we do?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as 'provided care', Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the campaign there had been considerable effort for the re-establishment of a train to determine whether such a train was paying for the electoral hours.
"In campaigns, less money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't think seriously about something," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at that time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was 'conscious', the former chief of the staff admitted that Obama had known this.
Martin added that ‘Double Down’ did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether the political explorations had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he was seriously thinking that Obama knew nothing of the investigations about whether to drop bids in the elections.
"Custom," Martin replied.
What's going on with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Did the design of the Internet service make e-mail similar to the conventional post technically implement the letter secret?
The conception of early Internet services focused on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account in establishing a stable basis for a hearing-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail corresponds more to an open postcard than to a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", then are the computers directly connected?
The email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run through several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content with his provider.
Are conventional e-mails being read through the network on their way?
Most of the mails are read several times by software robots.
Usually, the sender will check if the mail runs a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a nervous and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted out in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate by GMail about their coming holiday trip, Google can mix corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The probability of unauthorized people to read a mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, that is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails.
To this end, there are possible illegal expedition actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be encrypted effectively against read.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to embark on the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that even who has communicated with anyone can not be recognized without delay.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a convios consulting investigation from August 2013, Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While the shares of Yahoo-mail had recently fallen, GMail was able to make it clear by Google.
Mother scraped in the forest and collected pension
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and nursing allowances.
In order to continue to collect pensions and nursing money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest.
First of all, he trespassed the death of the 89-year-olds, then he had abolished the money for more than one and a half years.
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud, as a speaker said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May: At that time, it was noticed that no more drugs were needed for the nursing mother.
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to detect.
It was found that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
According to the police, there was no evidence of a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice lighting in the dark – with the help of quallen.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a luminous leaky.
The idea came to him after reading a research work on quallen and Chinese scientists were able to convince him to artificially produce the bright protein.
The ice cream reacts when eating with the tongue, thus lifting the pH in the protein and triggering the lighting.
Chris explains that the food ice reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you leak, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue with a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH-value increases and the ice shines.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever produced, because the quallen lighting substance is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and on impossible for itself because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that ice cream consists; but I suppose we find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a pain that are artificially produced by Chinese scientists
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six games.
The team of Ingo Ehlers will now come to the Derby against the TSV Daverden tomorrow, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game the season starts new for us.
"I hope we'll finally have our head free," Ehler's behavior is optimistic.
He finally, with the exception of the long-lasting Hendrik Blohme, has available his complete box.
Daverden, as we do, also sets on pace.
Therefore, we need to keep our mistakes low.
First of all, however, it is necessary to increase in coverage, which has last left everything other than a safe impression.
Daverden's Coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first seasonal victory against Nordhorn.
The game was of course a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because the Derby can always happen.
Nevertheless, Panitz wants to move in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-Young Joost Windßus, who is active with double-play law with the A-Young-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
Whoever isn't hot in such a game should stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was young, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress us for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become the Halloween Muffel.
In the last two years, I haven't declared myself ready to distribute from my home from sweets, and I guess I won't do it this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep on Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million in order to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion for sweets, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. association of retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm looking forward to every Halloween again is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the US dollars spent on 6,9 billion, according to the NRF.
This year, turbulent unleavened objects are the last scream.
Women don't have to hide in sexy clothing anymore, they can now also embodie seductive food such as pizza, hamburger or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft-Punk-World Spacemen will make it this year into the Instagram feeds.
According to Google, the most sought costumes are Zombies, Batman, Pirates and Witches.
I suppose it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and weren't alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend 330 million dollars this year for costumes of their pets, the NRF.
These are a lot of "Hot Dogs".
As far as sweetness is concerned, we're not implicit.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion for this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are approximately 270 million kilograms of chocoro gels, glues, bonuses and rubber bears.
So good news for the U.S. Ministry of Trade, 41 million people who pull through the quarters with the word "sweet or saures".
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let's do nothing – eat.
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet candy corn; yet, 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Sweet Product Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion maizes.
It's a mystery I couldn't solve yet.
Nothing more belongs to Halloween than houses in which it spits.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spicehouses in the United States that earn $500 million redeem, says America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos on which you ping into your pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where you won't get rid of them again, and then leave one of the guys on which you are standing a comment like "net face expression".
But let's finally get to the wallets.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Cürbis when we were children, and the cutting of a cubic butterfly is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something that we have made from little on.
Fortunately, the "Baby in the Cürbis" trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so that most of us have grown up to rectify the cube and not to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars for shortages, the US Census Bureau.
The pubic leaflets, which slowly rotate in the front garden, probably come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of baskets were harvested this year.
If you want to do the right point, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and snatch some spicy from their 921 kilos of heavy cube.
Residence fire in Helmbrecht: Rescue forces mountains sold body
The firearm had to move out in Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof starts in the night to Friday fire.
The rescue forces mountain a chilled body out of the house.
At a fire in Helmbrecht, rescue forces found a chilled body in a three-family house.
Whether this is a resident is still unclear, as a speaker of the police in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening, it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefight arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All the other inhabitants had not been at home during the fire, the police speaker continued.
The building is not occupied anymore.
The exact cause for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest national church has launched an offensive to advertise for the profession of the pastor.
Background is a possible pastoral deficiency: The Evangelical Lutheran Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will be halfened by this position until 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day cycle itself.
With Burphien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full place to enthusiast young people for theology study.
At present, fewer and less young people decide to study theology after the abitur.
Burphia leads this to the process of decreation: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my calendar and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as a sailor.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well.
Surely there is more pay in the free economy, but theologians have a safe employer.
This comes to meet the young people of today, who are not just career, but a senseful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vigariat.
In thinly populated border areas, such as resin, Emsland or the Wendland, it could become difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite prominents who have studied theology.
The Theology Study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point bars as well as a free-speaking system.
The options range from enhanced brakes, a service package with support from bowler-works mechanisms and logistic support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for tensions and adventures and for a accessible way to world class events.
We are pleased to open this way in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format creates new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare new ones for the streets and reality of Rally Raid.
We really had fun to develop the defensive Challenge Wages – this will be a entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a day of training and testing at the Defender Challenge in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called for the rescue of a chick that was fixed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock spring in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby had escaped after a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the stone break in her horrible situation
Firemen sailed on rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The firefighter managed to secure a chick that was trapped on a 15 - metre front spring in a rock wall.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had walked away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 of whom the dog belonged, came to the rock break Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby back to receive and thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They desperately searched for their missing dogma and published help calls in social networks when she escaped in the stone break after the small traffic accident.
About 14:15 a.m. on Wednesday, a walker who executed his dog saw the streaked Ruby on the 15-metre high paragraph in the stone break.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the site and sailed to save Rubys, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue team specialist, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the floor.
She did not move a muscle during her salvation – she was as stiff frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then eaten a couple of dog peaches.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a great luck."
It was the possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian for examination but found nothing except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "To watch salvation was frightening."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her back in the poor.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had grown too large and it had collapsed, it was probably crashed.
The firemen have done great things.
It was really courageous what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firemen were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never did Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer to Jagger's song “Old Habits Die Hard” from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the old dryer tonight, and that “he took me up when I was 18.”
She added: "It's been a long time ago and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, on Thursday, said that he “needs categorically that he had ever made close attempts at Katy Perry.”
The representative added: "Perhaps she has confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling-Stones tour this year.
Her new album "prism" landed this week at place 1.
George Kerevan: European deflechting gives the Schotts the choice
A new day, a new fear story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with stack wire along the Hadrian Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde proposal pointed out the possible economic advantages that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, played no role in the headlines.
Neither has anyone mentioned that the EU Member States often remedy their strict rules if it is more favourable for them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued non-respect for Brussels would be a small concession to what one really wants from the Scotlands.
So, actually, no story.
And one that has already arrived in the years so that it already resembles a fossil: the first time I heard the 'independence means passport control' one at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the continuous repeating of this ancient history.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the association of Europe that has been set up after the war has been staggered.
With the Eurocrisis, the Europe project has officially died.
Overall in the EU, parties who are hostile to the EU or wish to throw the euro overboard as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptical Party was able to produce an alternative to Germany – founded this year only – nearly five million votes at the Bundestagswahl in September and thus effectively dismiss the Free Democrats (the Equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been local resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict savings policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is required by holding the common currency, many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The Euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments cause excessive budget deficits – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has committed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devaluating the local currency, South Europe is reappeared to Germany with an integrated productivity disadvantage.
The only possibility is to cut wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
A deeper European problem of productivity is behind the current budget and monetary problems.
As a result of the "green" energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays the double for electricity and the fourfold for gas compared with the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All wage records in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American ship gas.
As a result, a revolt rises, especially in France, the EU's former Cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in chess and raise Paris at the height of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has oppressed Europe's own economic policy, which has to fight with the attacked French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU enemy Front National has just won a decisive re-choice, thus referring the ruling socialists to place three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the voters – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It wants to use the EU's elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties are well cut off in these elections – and that is very good possible – then for the first time, such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I want to go: in the future, the growing retention against the EU and the common currency will be together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the 'Europe of the (sovereign) nations' which General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to dismiss from this project in the hope that it will be in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific area suggests that Britain will stand in the Atlantic rain alone.
Where's Scotland staying with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suppose that Scotland could be very well driven in a more loose European association if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider that Norway is equal to it and that we maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is, remarkably, the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) reductions which the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib had to be responsible for the coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide on an independence now, just to get a savings policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Grow faster
Afro-American and hisanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white agemates, as studies show.
Physical changes do not mean puberty directly yet
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family topics.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows at the age of seven or eight years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time tranquilizing parents – this is usually not a sign of the fact that the puberty is now rapidly entering,” said Kaplowitz.
Obviously displays of development, such as growing breasts, sham and axle hair, as well as body smell, are shown earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift at the age of the menarche (treatment of the first regular bleeding) over the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the development of the breasts begins, it takes at least two to three years to the menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Frehe Pubertät bei Mädchen: The essential counselor for dealing with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test as the puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of the puberty, but it is "frühreif" when the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth shock of eight years ago.
In most cases, the process is slowing or stagnating – something that a pediatric physician can closely monitor.
In faster advances, tests may be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defense of another episode: premature aging of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child, development speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is reluctant to medications, but he admits: “Suppression of puberty can reduce behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their agemates.”
The other major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had received her ten days.
Even though there were first signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She was scared and excited from school home because she was the first in her group of friends.
There are many extensively published theories on the causes of early pubertancy.
However, there is no clear evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media would be cause.
Boys come to puberty like girls earlier.
Caplovitz is the view that the most convincing premises are the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which creates a link between body fat and the entry into pubertancy.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African and historical girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white agemates.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to have an early puberty influenced by all possible things, from economic conditions over climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although the facial and shame hair is already growing earlier, the trend to a full-introductory former puberty is not as pronounced as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of acne and shame hair is widespread even in babies and infants.
"We need to be careful about identifying the true beginning of the puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to be advised by their pediatrician how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to talk earlier than expected,” said Kaplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if he enters earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers are fighting in the face of large orders of seating width
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a dispute about the width of seats in the tourist class at long-distance flights, which indicates the sound for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seating width that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class – not always those to which airlines are most endeavouring, but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co's latest aircraft.
Airbus requested this week a industry standard which prescribes a seating width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. archrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide.
The conflict comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are weaving to sell even larger versions of their two-motor long-distance flights and expect record orders during the event from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the plane is designed, in particular whether there are rows with nine or ten seats, it is crucial for the economic results that the new “mini-jumbo” design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that its modernised '777X' includes 406 persons at tourist class seats, which are over 17 inches wide and allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often share Hiebe on technical details using advertising in the press.
Airbus now appeals to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to make the race.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new war of ads, showing donors a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are tighter than regional Turbo-Props," says Airbus Head of Dispatch John Leahy.
In view of changing dietary habits, people become thicker, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and the weight of the male average American increased by ten percent between 40 and 49 years, according to the data of the US Health Ministry.
The size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says that his rival is following a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body size of the newly baptized "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been conducted that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing contradicts Airbus' figures on the level of seats and says that it is not in the measure of the manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between flight tariffs and establishments.
The company also explains that, according to investigations, the experience in the plane depends on more than the width of the seat.
"There is really a need to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe to be successful," explains the flight cabin expert Kent Craver von Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate them what makes them profitable.
You know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the conflict, a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices over the next decades, which could have a sustained impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the conflict over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-motor long-range designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
The statements of Boeings on the results depend on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than in the case of currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore quests more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passport Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts said that full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers decided to make a closer arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper flight tariffs.
"Aightteen inches of seating would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert on cabin establishment, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world travellers of Jet sellers even contribute to the band size to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with highly compressed design for cheap airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but according to its own statement, no one has sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of adaptability of the cabins and has offered wide seats on the gangs for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be pardoned, but could deduct from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make fun when smoking the garbage
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
One single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further trials are needed, which can last a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches," says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified so that it contains the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus infects the liver cells selectively, which then produce a constant current of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, thus a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice, which were administered nicotine, kept their normal level of activity.
In contrast, mice without vaccination had taken a 'outtime', the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain.
The experiments are described in Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and unpractical.
However, the cost of the new vaccine is probably considerably lower, because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if he was absolutely sure to be given children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But more likely that smokers would use him to stop.
“Then they know: when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to dispose of the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was necessary.
Tripodi objected to having been influenced by Obeid
Against the former minister of the laboratory party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, a investigation is initiated by the state of corruption.
The former NSW Minister objected to changing the rules for marital lodging at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden participation in three lands on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) extended its investigations on whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of State to extend leasing contracts at Circular Quay, where Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tendering for their expiry in August 2005.
Now, because of the accusation, Tripodi had known obeids' hidden interest in the lands, after Tripodis had stated that former deputy rodsman Lynne Ashpole had spoken accordingly on Thursday.
In years of discussions that started in 2005, the government had urged public tenders for passenger contracts.
On the other hand, the patrons wanted longer periods.
In 2009, the passenger contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, who spent the Obeids $2.5 million per year, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Harbour Minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally voted for public tenders.
However, he refused to have made the changes to requests from Obeid, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced to reconstruct the government's passenger schemes.
One of the telephone records presented by the ICAC showed discussions from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Harbour Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the topic discussed in this telephone call the preparation of commercial pension schemes?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but that was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighters attack target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, confirmed a leader of government to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target had been, but said that it had been at least one.
According to Associated Press, the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year Israel has already performed air blows on rocket deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "truth tests"
In the framework of extended measures, the Government considers a "truth test" for foreign workers with 457 visas.
If the test is introduced, it would be used via a criterion that would prevent the 457 from being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the accession of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government's proposal of discussion was published after the former members of the Labour Party, Maxine McKew, had condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be regarded as insults by the neighbours of Australia.
“Large explanations such as ‘for foreigners to put themselves in the back’ and ‘for Australians to stop first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she said today to the Australia India Institute.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region contemplate an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures once taken by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who last night lived on talks about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still considered.
If the 'authority criterion' is taken over, a person requesting a visa may be verified in such a way that 'the application is real in the cases where the applicant is related to or connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company'.
Companies could also be obliged to make account of the number of 457 visa owners, after in the past companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri-Lang Asylant probably died of a heart attack after he had arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the British government to increase the benefits of the HS2 ice railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and North England already at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project 'will bring the UK closer together'.
Schottian Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very happy to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
HS2 Ltd has commissioned the British government to search for further route capacities and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together."
We move forward with HS2 because it brings enormous advantages.
Without it we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for 'indispensable' to be used for the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail connection is the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, but at the same time, the economic force of Scotland provides an argument for fast railway connections throughout the UK."
That is why we are delighted to work as a partner of the British government and to examine the options for high-speed rail connection in Scotland, which creates advantages for all and complements the connection Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish government already plans.
I am looking forward to examining the investigation report with the British Ministers next year and to decide together the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force provisionally in Australia
Australian flight passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones when starting and landing, despite efforts in the USA to lock the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers on their devices can read, view or play e-books during critical flight phases, if they are in flight mode.
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do this, but many people find angry that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they start and land.
Australian societies observe the decision to implement the U.S. airlines with a lot of work, but do not pursue any plans to amend their regulations.
The CASA also stated that the announcement would be considered, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply.
'CASA has no specific rules on the use of electronic devices in the aircraft' was announced.
The subject is subject to provisions which require airlines to maintain security at any time and to follow the safety instructions provided by the cabin staff.
Virgin has already launched flights with CASA discussions on an extension of its Wi-Fi entertainment system and has explained that one is open to changes but should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment) during the flight," said one speaker.
Qantas said that you would stay with the current regulations until further.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices are not allowed to be used when starting and landing, and we have no plans to change that," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations where passengers can benefit, and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons for that.
The decision has a different effect on U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, handbags and customer instructions.
"After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," announced the FAA.
In rare cases in poor sight, the crew will instruct the passengers while landing the devices.
The group also recommended that heavier devices be safely stored under the seat or in the subjects above the seats when starting and landing.
In front of the district of Schalke, BVB pendants with light rockets had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund announced hard consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras responded with a silence - first.
It was an uninhabited, almost already spectacular acoustic, which offered the viewer in the signal Iduna Park until the beginning of the Bundesligaspiel between the German Vicemaster Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart.
Most of the guests with their songs were to be heard.
On the other hand, the southern tribunal, where the faithfulest of the faithful and loudest BVB fans stand, presented itself exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle calls.
The podest of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the common fire, remained unoccupied.
And in front of the tribune, a large flag lonely wound with the title "Section Stadium prohibition".
Only as a gatekeeper Roman Weidenfeller as always the first BVB player entered the place, branded a short-term jubilee.
When his teammates followed, there were loud vocals and weeping scarfs - but at long last not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribunne.
Even that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again counted the positive experiences of the last days - Derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebration.
Only five minutes before the pinch, the Capo clogged his podest - and the up to that time tangible tension with hands evolved into a loud scream, when Dickel as usual asked the mood on the slopes in the stadium.
The last thing was like always the Southern Tribüne on the line - and finally here was again as usual the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came from the South Tribunne, everything was as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB hookers had fired into the spectators and on the place – and hit almost gatekeeper Roman Weidenfellers.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the tips of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and it is believed to Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the whole ultra-motion," the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbid that," he said.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnology.
In addition, the ultras have been shown different possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, says Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction until the end of the next week.
"That's gonna be cutting," assured Watzke.
You can be excited about how the reactions to the Southern Tribun.
Pond houses tree in Singapore, as the crisis has arrived in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armband, a ring, and a couple of ear rings in the shopping centre of Bendemeer in Singapore to pay the school fees of her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, there's all my money in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (approximately EUR 1,730) every month as an administrative worker and also work her husband, she explains that the monthly family income is not sufficient.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where the debt of the households increases – is so great that ValueMax, where she made its exchange, became the third pantry that was listed on the singapurian stock exchange this week.
The placing of jewelry is not only a faster way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an uncertain bank loan.
Typically, pound houses in Singapore require an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just about 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank demands, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, penalty houses offer the advantage that there is no need to review the creditworthiness or income evidence, and therefore loans are faster than possible for banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are addressed to patron houses after families feel the pressure of increasing costs of living and increasing budget and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and medium-sized incomes are looking at patronages in order to compensate for the difference in hammering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing budget debt, mainly through rising mortgages, described as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, according to the Agency, have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
Economic operators are also concerned because of the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing export weakness and a reduction in consumer demand.
"In the final effect, this means that people in the middle to lower segment (income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malay bank.
Historical peaks of the gold prices over the past two years have increased the trend of placing personal items as people use the opportunity to transform the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the items spent in the 200 pound houses of the city’s state are gold.
People say: “The price of gold looks good, let us pick up the gold chain of grandmothers and get back next month."
The largest Thai pedigree operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pound business is so strong that ValueMax, branch operators in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, not only wants to expand to the neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, says Ja Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances it by 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it received this week with the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some creditors were in the crossfire due to high interest rates, Ja explains that not only cheaper interest rates were paid than other borrowers, but not directly increased debt.
"Customs borrow items they already own, and the liquidity of personal assets does not increase the budgetary disagreement," she explains.
The socio-economic borrowing business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use penalties are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to spend gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social shift come to us.
"These include wealthy people who lend something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge narrows in the cash flow," says Yes.
Sometimes they just need money very fast.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The secret service enthüller Edward Snowden has fundamental interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly brisant NSA-speed affairs.
According to the Green Federal Minister Hans-Christian Ströbele, during his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia, it was about the conditions under which the former secret service staff would express at a German prosecutorship or before an investigation committee.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, said Ströbele to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government is based on the hard conditions associated with the savings package of over 325 million dollars for Tasmanian healthcare in order to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth would take 'indefinite measures' to prevent a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The financing for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has touched an emergency rescue package which we believe is addressing the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The 325 million dollars package includes 31 million dollars of emergency aid for elections.
Further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to gray star, should eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston, better care after stationary stays, medical training, psychic health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas of which clinic workers affected have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister held a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effective and efficiently as possible.
According to Wilkie today, the 325 million dollars would only benefit little if "they were not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the Federal Aids will make a major contribution to taking the state's public health system from the list of concerns," said Wilkie.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely be settled by the recent cuts.
But Peter Dutton, the health policy speaker of the opposition at the federal level, is the view that today's announcement is only a 'plaster solution'.
"We are in the position today because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said to ABC TV.
It can't be that a government gets almost half a billion dollars out of the system and puts into the Commonwealth 300 million and then do as if it were good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package is spent for additional bureaucracy.

Syria has destroyed its possibility of producing chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important chemistry weapons and poisoning gas munition facilities, the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while there was serious collisions in the north of the country near one of the locations where suspected toxic substances were stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had soon been killed three years ago since the beginning of the civil war.
The announcement of the organization for the ban on chemical weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
1 November, which the organization of Damascus established in The Hague to destroy or “inoperable” all plants for the manufacture of chemistry weapons, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The conclusion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has to begin destroying existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarine.
The announcement came at a time when battles took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, the experts say there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites here, as the Syrian Human Rights Observatory reported in Britain.
The activist group, who persecuted the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of which 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the side of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militia.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape from the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels for weeks in Safira, many of which have links with al-Qaida groups.
The Observatory said that there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underlines the danger that chemical weapons inspectors are exposed, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous weaponsmenal is a race against the time in the midst of a tremendous civil war.
According to OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, the team is “not convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixed/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has experienced its destruction.”
Therefore, ‘no further inspection activities are currently planned.’
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of Damascus places.
Because of security concerns, the visit of two institutions was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday the OPWC stated that the two locations had been "resigned ... and the objects of the Chemical Arms Programme had been transferred to other listed bodies that were inspired."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the Executive Committee of the OPWC.
"I take the guard against the braveness and the courage shown by you all when fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Surveillance Organization, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mostly Sunny Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad's government and its security forces, which belong to many of the Alavites, a breakdown of Shitian Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the Observation Group, Rami Abdurrahman said, on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he explained.
Anger on Judgment for Bombing Armies of Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who had died in 2002 in the bombing attack in Bali were angry with the judgment for the last of the instigators who had been put before the court, as Umar Patek believed that they should be killed by the law.
Patek, who was nearly ten years on the run as one of the most sought persons in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to a 20-year prison sentence for his role in the construction of bombing bodies.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many more were injured.
A debt was also made in a series of terrorist-related claims, which counted a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on a sanctuary evening in 2000.
The prosecutor had demanded a life-long imprisonment, even though he could have applied for the man, who, for his reputation as a master bomb builder, also called "demolition man", the death penalty.
The decision aroused painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the wounded by Patek and his fellow conspirators almost ten years ago.
With tears fighting, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow the other guys' footsteps.
"You should put him before a shooting command," said Corteen to AAP.
I have to live every day with not getting any other grandsons and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground when, on October 12, 2002, a huge bomb exploded in a small loadr that was parked before the night club shortly after 23 o'clock.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy's bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide offender exploded a backpack filled with spring dust.
After the attack, he fell into coma for a month and "star" three times, while he was hanging on a life-keeping system.
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbad and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before all others.
To let Him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bomb in court.
He took off nearly a decade of arrest, but was finally attacked in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US military forces killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden nearly four months later.
During the trial, a FBI agent said that secret services reports had made the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reconstructing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't stand," said Corteen.
Until recently, he has not shown repentance for how much suffering he has added to other people.
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is held with celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal against his judgment.
FAA: Air passengers are now able to use electronic devices in aircraft (but no cell phone calls)
From departure to landing, travellers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, listening to music and the reputation of films, but not calling with the phone, the new directives published by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the USA on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they were implemented, depending on the respective airline, FAA employees explained Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft conform to the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline staff and the rules for the storage of the equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines that would like to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in an announcement.
At present, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not start them until the plane reaches a height of three kilometers and gives the captain green light.
When entering the landing flight, the passengers must turn them off and do not start them again before the plane is landed.
According to the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA explained.
Most of the new aircraft and other aircraft that have been refined for the use of Wi-Fi in larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of flight companions, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it," commented Glading.
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like watchmen in this matter.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchange of e-mails, text messages, or download of data below three kilometres continued to be prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are invited to move smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still not a “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble similar online game, which the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave publicly a jet of American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the platform.
And more heavy devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight continue to be prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is not part of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift prohibition for certain electronic devices on startup and landing
Last month Mark Rosenker said by the Transport Security Authority National Transportation Safety Board, CBS News Security Expert, that mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
"Mobile is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential disorders in navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with broadcasters," says Rosenker.
A consultative committee of the industry, launched by the FAA to examine this issue, recommended last month that the government permit a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years the pressure on FAA has increased to loosen restrictions for use.
Criters such as democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become universal.
In some studies, it is mentioned that up to a third of the passengers forget or ignore the disabling of the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by travellers in 1966, after reports on the disorders of navigation and communication devices had become known by the UKW radios carried by passengers, which were then the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that electronic interference does not matter to them.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height is reached.
The airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interference.
The majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only give minimal radiation when you go around.
However, when downloading or sending data, transfer values are stronger.
One of the defenders of loosening the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E readers and made a test flight to find problems but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the passenger association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believes that the disorder through the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only individual reports from pilots that speak for a disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to set off the devices by passengers when landing instruments under bad visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as reasonable adjustments for travellers who would be fully equipped with technology today.
"We are delighted that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Released by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island of saved bird
A bird flying to the coast, which had been exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released to the nature by air rescue service.
The water hall was fought last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was popped up by the Scottish Animal Protection Organization SPCA in their Rescue Centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water hall was probably a winter bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds across the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
During her release, the water hall was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who care for prosperity and work in Britain want to change to our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 executives from the economy, representing approximately the sizes, sectors and regions of the UK.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found out that the majority of companies out of Europe have now exported and concentrated on countries that modernise and grow, while the countries stagnate in the EU.
They wish that new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil be favored by government, instead of holding up the long and effortful process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
In their view, the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competencies should be withdrawn to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, since, according to the companies, the costs of Brussels regulations would now exceed the advantages of being part of Europe’s trading zone – even 40 percent of the large companies agreed to the most traditionally Europe-friendly.
Finally, and this probably says most, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wishes to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade is not based on politics.
This knowledge, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy urges a "sensible change" that brings the issue of action back to the UK.
This is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of the remainder in the EU in a popular vote at 16 percent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for renegotiating the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power from a renegotiation to the UK.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the euro area is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows what an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels's approach to regulations is for companies.
Alexei Miller von Gazprom refers to Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasera
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board said.
"The present event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Straam gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe," said Gazprom Chairman, Alexei Miller, on Thursday in a statement.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A conflict between Gazprom and its pendants in Ukraine, in which the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe, ensures an increased risk of conventional routes, as can be heard from officially.
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are ‘forever’.
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at favoured rates when the whole project is operating in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinated countries should begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic framework data are voting, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in the European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Europe, the Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, pointed to the 9th real estate day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
According to Ulbrich, how German commercial property was sought, the view of the volume of transactions is shown.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the Plus was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Immobile investments offer an attractive interest rate," said Ulbrich.
The return between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been accused of sexual offences related to children before claims against child career Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Committee on Sexual Misuse of Children learned.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA explained that "in the organization one had never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case where a YMCA co-worker had been charged with child pornography for breaches, and another one in which a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall had been sentenced in 1991 for his misuse of entrusted children.
Hare said Gail Furness, a lawyer assisting the Commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know the second case.
He acknowledged that the opening declaration of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there had been external checks of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as the front front in child safety".
However, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Department of Education) in August of the year.
Hare, who began at the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had failed “from me down” in the attitude of Lord and did not ensure that employees had clarified their obligations to report infringements of the directives on child security.
Lord had been sentenced to the YMCA during his two-year-old work for sexual crime at twelve boys at the beginning of the year.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argued, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented employees from reporting Lord's infringements regarding the safety of children.
The staff said that they had observed infringements, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for her as a babysitter, put her on his shot, told one that he loved it, and let children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the chairman of the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very inconveniable.”
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have believed to repay their supervisory report.
Instead, he said, they had affected their friendship with Lord, so they would not have reported him.
Hare explained that he had informed the Board of Directors of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the 'Jonathan Lord Interference' was 'not reporting' by employees, and the board had agreed to him.
Hare said that the decision to insist on the employees to sign confidentiality obligations shortly after the allegations occurred had been taken by the managing director of the children's services of the YMCA, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence, but what had been 'over-easy' and badly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children in the period between 2009 and 2011 when Jonathan Lord was employed, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, Expert for Sexual Child Misuse, explained to the Commission.
He explained that there had been "intensive problems" in the recruitment, review, processing, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed by 20 December.
Tony Blair said that he would use the chance of returning as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening at the fifth anniversary of his withdrawal from the office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various internal policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided expressing himself to British politics, and his comments are usually limited to foreign policy and its role as an ambassador of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted from the London Evening Standard, saying: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely that this happens, so ..."
When the horse-seeing experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to shorten the horse of the year, they realized that there was a hard competition.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirps, which has not even been in the kindergarten and just made its first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee loosely drove through the three rounds and picked up the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equally large, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
During his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap in a french angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony that lay far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since then practiced each day with Shetland Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great excitement."
They had to tackle the entire participant field and went out with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all enthusiastic when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said: "The whole audience was like electrified and everyone fired him and clapped him."
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he has done fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares for.
As he started, it will not take long until he is on the "Pferd of the Year" shawl – and I am sure he will cut off well.
One speaker of the annual horse look said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
They're a great team together.
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee according to how well they had beaten and presented in the lead ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothing has contributed her part to it, that really fitted perfectly for the occasion.

A Chinese newspaper, which had requested the release of a reporter who had been charged for diffaming, was to be reformed, said a press regulator.
The New Express, located in Guangzhou, had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribe money to fake reports about a national company.
Now the New Express will be subjected to a 'comprehensive rectification', said the Regulatory Authority.
The Regulatory Order was issued by the Office for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Initial investigations showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said that it was decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter license.
In addition, “the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been ordered to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant responsible members of the New Express and to verify the New Express leadership team without delay.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion.
After he had been arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front side and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared in the state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and their ability to gain the confidence of the public," he explained to the public news station CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out of money and fame.
I realized that I was wrong.
After Chen's Excuse, the New Express published an apology on the front page and explained that one had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that concessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year, where the authorities were forbidden to force someone to accuse himself.
Drug tunnel with own rail between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for the drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electrical rail operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeter measuring tunnel as one of the most filthy passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of nearly six football fields in the zigzag pattern, combines warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless unmistakable warehouses in the area, which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unannounced, the authorities explained.
During the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured, the records of the court.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were accused of the ownership and the intention of selling marijuana and cocaine.
They are threatening prison sentences between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smuggler sets on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which challenges the drug cardle how to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves
actor Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themselves.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year-old Flynn.
The actor Orlando Bloom has spoken to separate himself from his wife, the top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "the life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and he and himself still loved themselves, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to vegetarianism, but is quite different from that.
For while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream gates, ice or a powerful Edamer, these muds are not on the food card of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the refusal of meat and fish, the vegan leaves from all the consumption of animal products - also honey is neglected.
What remains may be wondered, but at a closer consideration, the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable intrigument.
"Broth strokes are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, who provides a variety of special products for veganians.
Reuben Proctor also enjoys visiting the shop in the Domgasse.
For 13 years the native New Zealand countries have lived vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (nearly) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became Veganer.
"The conviction, however, came not only because of the food, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, the art leather prefers normal leather.
He realized that it is also in other everyday interests without animal products.
First of all, vegan is being an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor expresses the maximum of the Vegans, which extends to all consumer behaviour.
Instead of tracing castles, stirring eggs or rubber bears, the Veganer quickly discovered entirely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," says Proctor today, "actually vegan is not a resignation, no ascesis, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that you reduce the selection of food options with the nutrition leads Proctor more to the power of the habit.
And precisely these conditions also made some of the attempts that were so well meant fail.
"The addiction factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," says Proctor.
And turn in: "Certain delights are not to be fixed to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"You can also create the same effect in other ways," the Veganer explains.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, champignons and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue festival.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste delicately once.
Of course, one wants to have something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damages to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I don't take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share.
There are high-performance athletes that feed themselves exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are best, I often let myself check," says Proctor.
In particular, many Vegansimus Critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are nourished with feed instead of grasping on the pasture, it is questionable whether in the meat that is bought in the cooling rest the vitamin B12 share is high," says Proctor.
For Veganer there is also the possibility to take the coenzym in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are all right," he explains.
Proctor must not go far away for food procurement.
Basic foods are finally everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on the spot.
Just from time to time, I'll buy something special.
"Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is known for "usual" finished products.
However, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small knifes you can achieve good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheese disease, Proctor was able to amaze his father-in-law.
Family festivals give the Veganer a new spice.
That has dynamics when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise are as different as human beings themselves," says Proctor.
But, of course, he was already faced with skepticism.
Don't taste my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - In such questions you have to act as a vegan with a finger-point feeling.
"I don't deny people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to eat it.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not appear as veganfremd as suspected - and the Veganer is not as restricted in everyday life as generally assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many dining shops offer Falafel, or just a vegetarian Yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates on pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are doing so slowly.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealand countries can find out a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If enough demands come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop, such as the bird-free comb in Mannheim or the café.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least a vegan dishes on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Everyone can eat them, so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"Fleeish dishes are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part of the world impossible beforehand," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning.
In particular, when one learns to understand, which can also be contained in peanuts of animal additives as a painter, it seems that with the follow-up of ethics in so many hurdles and traps, one quickly leaves the courage.
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning agents.
"Afterwards, one develops a scanner view and knows which signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stand or to stup," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes consciousness.
Perhaps he does not fully manage to put down his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
The trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator made technical problems responsible.
The other 11 US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business without impediment.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger peninsulas with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indexes had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August this year, there had been two pans alone in one week.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent massively faulty purchase orders to the options markets because of technical problems.
As a result, the stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through the orders and delete them.
Two days after that, half of the total share trade in the USA came for several hours because of a computer pan at the Nasdaq stock exchange.
In addition, in the past year, the stock exchange of Facebook had provided for attention.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of purchase and sale orders, later established the SEC stock market supervision and thundered the company into a record penalty of $10 million.
Constanz: Radler drives 63-year-olds
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man traveled on Thursday evening, at 10:00 a.m., with a lady bike on the left path from the station square to the marketplace.
Suddenly, when a 63 - year - old man walked away from a local, the cyclist was no longer able to brake in time, according to police.
During the next collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, went further to the ground and pulled an approximately 15 cm long place wound on the head.
A rescue car team brought the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British Police Assange gives an delivery decision
Today, the British police have given a delivery decision to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said that the 40-year-old Australians had been given a "requirement to stand" calling him to appear in a police guard, and added, he should not follow it, threatened him the arrest.
Assange threatens delivery to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence, after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court has rejected its opposition to the delivery at the beginning of the month.
Since he feared that Stockholm would deliver him to the USA, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has called on a 40-year-old man to stand at a police guard at one of us, said one speaker.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on deposit.
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call.
Assange fears that he was delivered from Sweden to the United States and accused there for possible spionage accusations after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on WikiLeak's enthusiasm website.
Drivers with 210 km/h and hot beverage between the legs receive 1.000 £ penalty
A car driver was punished a penalty of £ 1,000 because he had driven up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Howie was guilty in front of the Colchester Court of Justice, without the need for care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month drive ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of £90 and a surcharge of £100.
Taxes for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Ministry of Finance has temporarily calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who in 2012 had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on apartments that cost over two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold homes as a company and not as individuals.
Already, the revenue from the tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which was 708 million pounds in the fiscal year 2012/13, the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: "After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against trafficking, it is difficult to claim that high-quality property is too low, regardless of the impact of the obsolete community tax system."
"But this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant in terms of the purchase of property in London, or retain owners from selling it," he added.
First-class properties – the highest five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London south-west belt extending from Fulham to Wimbledon have deserved the record value of 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging domestic market, where the southwest part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to Savills.
Scientists could take more light on what the tail of a dog stands with his mood.
Earlier research showed that happy dogs with the tail were more to the right (from the view of the dog), while it was the left side of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurosciencer of the University of Trient, said: “In human beings, it is well known that the left and right brain half reacts differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemisphers played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side tail rolling of their species, the researchers monitored the animals while these films were watching other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four beans and analyzed the behaviour.
Probably we will soon understand why the cock moves into the one, once in the other direction
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a naturally faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate different aspects, so we could control the movement of the tail more to the left or to the right.”
When the animals saw how a otherwise impressive dog moved the tail to the right (looking from the perspective of the wedding dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But the tailclothing was primarily left (from the perspective of the dog who flies), so their heart rate rose and they looked uncomfortable.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs had learned from the experience of which movements they should worry and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wedding with the tail in one direction is more linked to friendly behavior and the right side produces a less friendly behavior, then one responds on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, expert on dog behavior and guest fellowship at the Faculty of Animal Medicine at the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study in which was studied whether left and right was important for dogs.
Last year a team of Lincoln University found out that dogs turn left when they look at a aggressive dog, and right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research work at Victoria University in Canada, the following said: “Honds go to a robot dog rather if his ‘Schwanz’ turns to the left and not to the right, instead of becoming unrested – exactly different from that in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore affect that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"Although there are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halfs are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs do not form an exception," says Bradshaw.
But because their behavior is simply recorded, it will probably not take a long time until we understand why the tail sometimes moves into one, sometimes in the other direction.

Pope Franziskus appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Franziskus was first called new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who choose a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal that has reached 80 years of age is no longer able to participate in the Pope election – this is the case with a group of 120 “choosing cardinals”.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman of the Vatican, said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals known as a concession.
"Papst Franziskus has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistorium in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero by Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals will probably have fallen by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as needed so that the number of elected cardinals amounts to 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistorium next year is important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a certain overhang on the side of Europe, and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Cardinals Council founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding opportunities for reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Franziskus has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was “good possible” that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this position – this is all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically call from large places to cardinals, but Franziskus “she sits full of surprises – so we don't know who he is appointing.”
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seatlength
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Piccup trucks with the 2014 construction year to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seatlength, according to a communication from the U.S. Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Safety on Friday.
In some of the cars there can be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat loan.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines on vehicle safety in case of head restraints.
"When the vehicle is driven from the back, it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the inmates, so that there is an increased risk of injury," the news was published on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The recovered models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of the GM-Trucks started in June and represents the main model start of the leading US car manufacturer since insolvency-related restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra-Trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, explained GM on Friday.
In October GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup trucks.
The GM share rose by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange.
Distortion scream of an Obama cyclist
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been hampered by the blockadetics of Republicans
Blockade policy does not apologize for Obamacare’s website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election struggle were a sad memory of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year.
I'm currently reading a very sad book.
It's a book I believed it would raise me up during the devastating second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (to win) and describes Barack Obama's memoirs as the 2008 presidential election.
If I'm finished with my patient books in the evening and go to bed, then the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could rob the breath.
The choice became an earth-ruth victory and the news speaker held inside to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy, and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready to change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had a consent of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Again switching to the present is a bad awakening, as if you were torn out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed possibilities.
In the years since I first played my voice, something has actually changed.
But it's nothing I could've imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced absence of homosexuality in the army and the killing Osama is Ladens.
I also believe that the blockadetics of the party policy have struck too many attempts to bring our nation forward: immigration reform, a public health insurance option and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name only a few.
But after countless times I defended the Obama Government to colleagues and acquaintances, I came to the end with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The republican blockade policy cannot explain why you allow the hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private life of Americans and why whistleblower is punished, which reveals state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, has been murdered without procedures, nor why the public finance and expenditure limits will be destroyed during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, in which it states that the efforts of the White House to raise the media are the 'aggressivest... since the Nixon Government'.
And recently, it cannot apologize for the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that government work could contradict its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the Office of MEPs is not a predictable course, since a opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre form the public discussion.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that's most disturbing me.
I chose Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidate.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unarranged alternative, he seemed unable to define his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard so long.
However, with the reduction of the consent values for Obama to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so harder by this book.
It raises my longing for the many promises that have resolved in air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to inject a serious loss against Clinton in the elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his employees that they should return to course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't give you a stronger vote.
The views expressed in this comment are only those expressed by Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflicts of interest in parental leave
Milliardary and Mr Clive Palmer say that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters would become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnet, which is in a judicial dispute about the payment of $6 million to CO2 tax, raised the claim when he wanted to wipe questions from the table, whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbot would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she receives vacation or not," said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the election commission of Palmer, with 53 votes, officially declared advance after the recast to the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a revision of the process to tell the vote so that it would be easier.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which one marchs in, enters the data into a computer, immediately selects and then has the result at 6:30 a.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the voting tablets.
Do you use them because you can eradicate the results if you don't like them?
To vote with pencils today is incredible.
The Election Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic choice and recently published a common legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy was an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very serious".
A public office concerns the public service.
"We are not striving for any reward except for history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this Community," he said.
RBS suspends two exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its currency department, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indicative of the fact that the worldwide governmental investigation on the supposed manipulations of the currency market is rapidly taking on the journey.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the investigations in the world's largest financial market on which $5.3 billion switches the owner daily.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal around the Libor interbank business draws.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigations on this subject continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," said the Bank two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation of close persons indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier dealer to the UK Supervisory Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010 and was meanwhile allowed by his current position as European leader of the Forex spot trade with JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was allowed this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No one of these dealers was accused of any misconduct.
Bankers of Barclays and the Citigroup were part of the Uzher Instant Message Group, said the situation of close persons.
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of its employees, after the Swiss regulatory authority had explained Finma that it was investigating a supposed manipulation of the exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with the fact that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said with the situation familiar persons.
Banks combine instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has brought dealers into a field that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affairs and said it was almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and high-grade liquid exchange market, but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading dealer noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to the fact that “you can already influence the market with very low ticket prices”.
The message came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had terminated a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he had caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is inhibited," said Credit Suisse.
The building fence painted on the Bechtle base
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has enthroned the Bauzaun on the Bechtle base at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and spread the footpath, says a press release.
The planned coverage of the crushing house in the back part of the property was not allowed for security reasons because the site threatens to relieve.
Alfred Abel, who currently managed the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke to the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a transparent message "We are for it" was applied.
This, however, did not interfere with the action of some 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative.
Their motto on the large poster called "We are against Bauruinen".
So she wanted to point to the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In conversation with many passers before the "building site", it became clear that some citizens believe that it would be much better with the implementation of the city's project, although few have the same questions as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city continues to delay these answers, it says from the side of the BI.
As it was to be heard, the mayor’s public statements also affect.
In May, at the municipal council meeting, he had said that he was afraid of the out of the thermal bath, the population should vote in the decision of the citizens against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss Wiese.
Some appear to be very scared for this reason, others feel that they are a "plumpened attempt for expression" to the population, says the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte für Schiris: Mane no Schwalbenkönig
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high-form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg is, the sports director of the "bullen" was disappointed by the arbitration judges.
"There is at present a dangerous tendency for mane and alan to be pushed into the category of swallow kings," he took the two offensive collaborators in protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
Last occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, where the Senegalese became a so-called acting series for defeat - which was of course not as the TV images showed.
"A crazily wrong decision," said Rangnick, who called the arbitrator Harkam "to be overwhelmed."
Harkam had also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
He defended his German countryman: "Then I would have acted as Roger Schmidt in every situation."
Schmidt himself wants no contact with his colleague after the shelter with Hütter.
I didn't know why.
"For I am the one who was insulted," stressed the 46-year-old.
However, in view of the success run, Rangnick agreed to a praise hymn.
"There are only two words for that: good," he noted.
There's not much to stop.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
That's how it's going on.
Framework changes in the winter transfer time will hardly exist.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Except for a player, he wants to leave the club," stated Rangnick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health law
It is a great victory for the government of Obama: The U.S. Supreme Court decided today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces US citizens to complete a health insurance by 2014 or pay a penalty – is constitutional under the tax authority of the State.
The chief judge John Roberts struck on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the comprehensive law and also considered that the condition of the health law, in which state states would either have to extend the access requirements for medication or otherwise remove all state medication funding, would not be unlawfully restrictive.
The appeal proceedings against the law had been enforced by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes itself light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their dark valley.
Because of the low sunfall rate, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors in 45 meters height, a century dream was true on Wednesday.
"Endly!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland swarmed at the launch ceremony in TV2.
Some of the valley residents set up sunshine chairs, others set up safely half sunshine glasses.
So far, sun hungry had to drive with a cable car to a close peak in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to lead the rays into the valley with mirrors.
But this basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After a multiannual debate, the City Council finally adopted the 5 million crowns (about 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has provided the Italian Alpine town of Viganella winterly sunshine for several years.
Post hardly empty Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for the Sunday eclipse are still on different core and parts of the city, but you will read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP notes.
A request from the FDP confirmed that.
On Sundays and holidays only before the postal building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in the Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be empty.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still cleared on Sunday, the response to the request of the FDP will not be answered.
The Social and Youth Political Speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to hook back here.
The Sunday apprenticeship is an important postal service just at Terminpost.
"This undertaking is radical and unreasonable in spite of the price increase for letters on January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, Group and City Chairman of the Liberals, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are changed or even deleted here."
The post is mostly away from citizens.
"At least, the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschlot and Rosengarten have to be re-educated on Sundays," said Bittner and Rohrbeck unisono.
Also for the Core Town, especially non-mobile fellow citizens, a letter box with sunday illumination would also have to be able to reach.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans conversations with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, was also a Sunday illumination in Hofheim.
Your party has voted for privatizations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurt Parking fees should rise strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive.
The magistrate of the city this morning advises on a submission of the traffic descendant Stefan Majer (Green).
Accordingly, parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, it is not intended to increase prices, but to reduce the time interval of parking watches and parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Decree will have to decide.
The IHK Frankfurt retail committee considers it "no good idea".
The possibility of parking directly before the business is "a not underestimating advantage for smaller retailers".
The Transport Club Germany believes that an increase after two decades "is quite appropriate and actually overwhelming" for the long term.
Public transport also becomes more expensive.
Joy City: Fast Actions Overthrow Hosts
With a narrow frame, the Lords I of the TSV had to join in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb.
The Elblers stood with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it was shown that she could not, also in terms of age, fully support with the rapid actions of the city of joy.
With the hard and placements, the Gönningers did very hard.
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network center and were not on site in the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of joy in all interests.
In view of this oppressive and play-determining performance, the third sentence was gained slightly lazy and lustless to the 3:0 end (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2, there will be a much more powerful opponent on the field with the TV Baiersbronn, which could clearly endure in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Buchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B class, in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn, the second teams from Baiersbronn and the city of joy were confronted.
They delivered a hard fighting two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and score gifts, and even in passes, the precision was sometimes deficiency and in some critical game scenes, the overeifer prevented the view of possible point gains.
In this very well-balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto voted through the great physical use and a delightful commitment of both teams.
Nursing day at the small English hut
A group of engaged participants met at the small English hut in Ibach for the fifth day of care in the following of the Natura 2000 project.
Because of suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the hut of view into the valley, mayor Helmut said Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Emperor, described this area as the shine of the gorgeous mountain, where the landscape offers the ideal frame for beautiful views.
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the link between humans and nature.
He offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time, the tourist aspect could also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Protection of the Government Presidium Freiburg following the greeting of the Land Council of Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the Schirmherrship and wished a good success to the action.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide-looking area covers the aim of maintaining the now-increasing old all-menddweid field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grass hops cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free links to maintain art.
Tribukait said she didn't want to break a lace for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamless in this plan.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised unesco status and thus a continuous supplement of the achievements of the life project and the previous care days for the future.
Following these different presentations, Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been beaten in the front, the forester was ready to call, if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of Wacholders and of the care of a dry stone belt.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Leapings: Köpfer still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the small town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future school, children's, youth and senior policies, as well as its own towns can be called attractive city, no second mayor candidate has yet reported.
The only candidate for the succession of the Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer candidate for age reasons, is the 46-year-old bank buyer and business manager Dieter Köpfer from Löffingen.
The period of application expires on Monday, November 11th, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei accused of Nortel patents
The group, which has thousands of former Nortel patents, stricted on Thursday a lawine of complaints for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was exempt from him in the insolvency auction of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that the Nortel patent purchased for $4.5 billion, claimed Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. district court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is claimed in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents involve technology that brings search termes into line on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the complaint that thus meets the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which stands in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial command for the Nortel patent over $900.000.
Google increased his offer several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After the Rockstar Nortel patents had been overbored, Google Motorola purchased Mobility for $12,5 billion, a business that was also motivated by Motorola's library on patents.
"Although Google failed with his attempt to acquire the appeal patent at the auction, Google has injured the patents and continues to do so," the letter of appeal states.
Rockstar demands a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is deliberate, the accusation.
Egypt defends first freely chosen President
Mohammed Mursi puts off the moon, but his day of triumph does not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a "new Egypt" when he was defended as the first freely elected president of the country and thus came to the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been dismissed 16 months earlier.
With his official introduction before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi was also the first freely chosen Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He put the oath in front of the 18 in black robes dressed judges of the judgment, which has its seat on the Nile and has an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," said Mursi at the solemn ceremony that was transmitted live on the state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the USA and member of the Muslim brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who had mostly been taken into sight by the government since its founding 84 years ago as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoi shortly after 11 o'clock.
Only a few hundred trailers had gathered before the court to commemorate the new president, and in contrast to the presidial prunk from Mubarak times, traffic was stopped only shortly so that the auto convoi could cross the usually occupied road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replace wheel” of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the efforts of the uprising from 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak to the goal.
"Egypts today are a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," explained Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with red tie, to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he put the office.
Later Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he had to speak.
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel who played the National Hemisphere, which he listened in Habsucht.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
When he arrived, he was welcomed by hundreds of attendants in the university's largest hearing room with talks of 'The Army and the People are a hand'.
The University of Cairo, built as a bastion of secular education in 1908, developed into a high-speaking Islamic student group in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi put a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising, which last year led to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he praised to call back presidial powers that the military council had taken over from the Head of State.
However, by deposing the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he bows the military's will, pointing to the continuation of the power struggle.
Mursis speech on the Tahir site was full of dramatic populistic gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides for two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger Discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On today's Friday evening it is called "Pump this party", on tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25-party.
Of course, fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers crashed by ladder: severely injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder when switching out of a defective outer feeler and was severely injured.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to replace a defective heater feeling at the outer facade of a guest house.
When he rose to the ladder on the roof corn, this slipped away and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought to the Salzburg National Hospital with the rescue screw "Christophorus 6".
Rape in South Africa: twice life-long detention
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice a lifetime on Friday.
This was reported by the transmitter SABC.
The victim later died of the consequences of severe injuries.
John Kana had been found guilty at the beginning of the week of crime.
The deed had triggered disruption throughout the country.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought 14 hours for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The young people's sight was so terrible that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted to be in a bar during the process of doing the night with Booysen.
He also confessed to beat them and raped them, but he argued that he was responsible for the death of the girl.
At first, the police had gone out of several offenders, but left two suspects out of detention because the evidence was not sufficient against them.
During the process, the prosecutor also stressed that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape in South Africa is almost everyday: there are around 64,000 advertisements every year for sexual violence.
These are almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, they have significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa appreciate the dark figures in sexual violence but the 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the black forest ham
Jumbo looking for the "best ham in the world": For the TV broadcast "Galileo" the Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited.
The speaker makes clear at the beginning: the most important for haming are the pigs, turbomas are not a good prerequisite.
Can hams that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains Jumbo the operation of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany dear ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest  Schinken.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the inside of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can grab the micro.
Jumbo to strengthen fast-imbises in forest shut
"Here I'm being worked with huge quantities," the television makers, black forest hams as a mass product amazed.
16.000 chalets a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat share, color: Uli explains what it is about quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"There I am excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," said Jumbo cynically.
The level of private television is presented here in pure culture.
But watching is worth it anyway.
The spectator sees that the crushing of the couls continues to be handy.
Because: Black forest hams is traditionally found without bones in the shelf.
The secret of haming is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoking tower and smoke fires remind Jumbo visually of a "U-boat".
The trick: Tan branches here in smoke ensure the special taste of the black forest ham.
20 days in smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
"He's really delicious," says the conclusion of the TV star.
This will enable all stakeholders to live.
You thought travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenue from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now proceeds from a adjusted annual profit before taxes between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
When the current target values are achieved, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As managing director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre earned eight percent profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start into the second half of the year, especially in Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are in good direction towards record year revenues before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest results.
In Australia, the recreational industry has recovered in the second half of the year, making a slightly weaker market for business trips.
It was similarly good for Flight Centre's recreational business in the UK, while the business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered compared to the seasonal condition weaker first half year, so that a profit is expected for the third year in a row for the total year.
The shares of Flight Centre rose by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses of English literature, students will have to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th - century novel, romantic lyrics and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The examination also contains 'unseen texts' to stimulate more wide reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, pupils have to make an independent GCSE test for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as separate qualifications.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculums for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that were radically redesigned.
Other core containers will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisory authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new notation system and less course work.
In a speech in summer, Minister of Education, Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our testing system to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would be "requisite, ambitious and stricter".
Studies show that in English schools there is less time spent for mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hourly schedule, coalition circles suggest that the comprehensive mathematics test – combined with a stronger weighting of the specialist in rankings – will probably encourage schools to use more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "Problems of the Right Life", including financial topics.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ökumenisches Gesprächsforum
At the next Ökumenisches Gesprächsforum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle, the theme "To hell with Hell - Theological considerations to today's dealing with the last things".
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ökumenische Gesprächsforum is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical churches Salem, Salem Castle and the Landseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to look at the question in the forum of how people are now setting up the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much of this in the past centuries and had put them on those images of heaven and hell, "who are making our ideas to this day," then the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of perfection appears rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope for Christian women has been dispersed by the religious criticism," says the Referent.
She has provided us with so many question marks that the calling signs seem to have come to us.
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death."
This involves the question of that desire, "who dreams that everything will be good at the end".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
==References====External links==
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the West Fälische Wilhelms-Universität.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has established a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Klein Heuberg reaffirm their confession in the firm
In two services 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the Seal Care Unit At Kleinen Heuberg have been committed.
In the morning, the Laudato-Si group joined the worship group, on the afternoon of the Youth Chor The Spirit.

In different projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared the youth day in underpoweral.
Illmene: Second mountain bike race enthusiasts participants
With beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course over the hill chains around the lake.
This tells Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Ilmene.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 meters of height, were numerous everyone's wheelers who once wanted to exercise their hobby in competition atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
These two were able to sit down from the field according to expectation.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advance to the goal and defended his title as a total winner of the short distance.
==References====External links==
With the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team of nightmare that made it up on the top of the winner staircase.
On place two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Observation.
A delightful development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only with regard to performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years with the youngests up to over 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race, even more absolute topathlets started this year.
Four drivers were able to retire from the regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike-half-profi from the Black-Tush-Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, was two times world champion at the twelve-hour car.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has already called two German master titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 meters of height, there was a diaper hitfinal in the target run before the three-seen hall.
Pangerl ran over the target line as the first.
Only a second later, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall rating.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came into the goal as a third of the overall rating.
In the women's evaluation, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
The second place secured Areane Blersch from Binzwangen to Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle offers free medical assistance in remote villages in Cameroon
Browsing and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, just one for 5,000 people
Do vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him to 'CNN Hero of the Year'.
The winner gets $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle saw how his sick father always lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals who did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation spread to his brain and caused a haematom that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father into overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and isn't the first one.
There are very many patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
By contrast, the ratio in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people.
However, even if a doctor would be present to them, most Cameroons could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organisation called ASCOVIME, who travels to rural areas over weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday, he and up to 30 people in small buses and ride with the tightened medical equipment on the roof over unresistant terrain to the villages that need help.
It's not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dance, and the best accommodation that the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebration and bwelling – with its broad smiles and unlimited energy – is happy to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning the team starts with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per ride," says Bwelle.
They come from a circular of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crochets, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is necessary for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local decay.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or a apartment; after the intervention the patients get up and go into the recreation area to make room for the next one.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is eaten by the generator of the group and thus Bwelle and its volunteers work until early morning hours on Sunday.
It's an effortful pensum, but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday the team then goes back to town, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work it creates a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a breach of boiling that he had received now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he sleeps," says Katie O'Malley, who studys at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and voluntarily works in Bwelles Group.
He is always either in the hospital or is trying to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gather practical experiences they would never get at home.
"We can be in operation where we help to drop blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," explains O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated sanitary material.
However, if they are once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
"He is undoubtedly a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life of this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people do not know any limits.
The nearly constant work for Bwelle is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier and thus fulfilling a promise that he has given to his Father brings him great joy.
"I am so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain.

Excellent mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hate in his metier, the acting art.
The old man Santiago can't make anything in fishing.
That's how the two just complement great.
They almost mean to see the folds in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman Manolo speaks.
If Santiago is tired of life sitting on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and finally wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will strength.
Janson is on a wide range as a single actor on the stage.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so that his monologue is no moment boring.
His efforts to draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made up of blue illuminated water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann let the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
During the performance, he sets the active scene in the light: the cabin of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor, which with her songs and her magnificent voice sings Cuba's feeling of life.
The four musicians play rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descending to the Romans
A sewage canal from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne at about 120 metres.
Whoever visits Cologne doesn't pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters the two towers rage into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigrane church towers know that there is also a lot to be discovered under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne's underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite spectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city's fathers wanted a auto-righteous city, so the remains of the old walls remained only that which was not too big.
Most users of the parkhouse are hiking away from the Roman remains today and only put off their car.
But whoever looks closer, discovers a archaeological discovery separated by metal grinding staves in the D2 park deck.
There are about five meters high ruins of handteller-size stones.
"There are remains of the Roman walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze leaves the participants at the top park level to take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep Tray.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is hardly perceived.
Next station of the tour is the pretorium, and here the participants climb down to the depth.
We experience here the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agripinsium", which means in good German as much as "Cities of Roman Law and City of the Agripins, founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar for the emperor's cult".
And the pretorium is the former governor palace, the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine.
From the front room of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman waste water channel, which is preserved here at about 120 meters length.
"You can walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," schoolze picks up the guests.
A surprise still has school.
After picking the key on the box, he leads the group to a 16 meters deep, walkable tray.
"We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bathroom," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bathroom deep into the ground to get to the groundwater which was indispensable for the ritual washings.
Until today, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins fall back to the eighth century, varying levels of water are revealed by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square for which the construction work will start soon.
However, a few years will last until completion.
Being almost hacked: New edition of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rockermilieu is rerolled up after over four years.
A process of attempted killing, harmful body injury and damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt Landgericht (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety arrangements.
The defendants were silent.
They were supposed to have been active in the Rockerscene and then belonged to the Bandidos.
In June 2009, the prosecutor advised them to have put in and hit three men in one car together with unknown complicities in Finowfurt.
All victims were seriously hurt, a man had almost lost his leg.
The victims were supposed to have belonged to the competing group of Hell's Angels.
One was supposed to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It seems that a pursuit with several cars was preceded.
According to the accusation, it was about district fighting and a powerful demonstration.
The two defendants had been released in a first procedure at the beginning of 2012.
At that time a court speaker said that it could not have been proved that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feather.
The offenders had wore masks and had not been recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof abolished the judgment after the revision of the prosecutorship and rejected it to the Landgericht for the renegotiation of proceedings.
One of the defendants is currently in an open way because of another offensive offence.
It was mainly about the reconstruction of the courses in Tatnacht.
As a witness, the Commissioner was invited to find out at that time.
In the center were cell phone calls of the defendants and other people who had heard the police.
Difficult is that Rocker is almost always adhering to a law for her before court - and not pronounce.
The same applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had packed out.
The prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor of Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new tracks had appeared since the last procedure.
Eleven further days of negotiation are set up for the process.
The removal company doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the trees of people on the passenger and back seat, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Of course, some cocktail or sect may be responsible for this!
What's closer than going to the next drive-in to give yourself a little bit?
I admit, I'm glad to join when it's going to the fast food holes at night or early morning.
A few pommes, a cola, a Burger - and then nothing like home and bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-governors become noticeable.
Because what has to be missing that with steady regularity you throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
In particular, the weekends have thrown paper bags on road edges and on parking.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags with home respective to the next trash?
It's not just that the paperwork is embarrassing the landscape.
Dozens have already covered transport facilities such as guide planks and caused accidents.
About that what thinks said "wheeft society" but not imagining, probably she doesn't even know what this word actually means.
When you travel more often in the evening, only with several people in the car, you know how a back bench can look like fed nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage tower.
There would be a few bags more or less of nothing - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the food remains of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and municipalities will have to blush away - and the fast food chains must demand for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal in health policy
After severe criticism yesterday, President Obama made a withdrawal of his often repeated, clear promise: "If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands received an announcement letter from their insurer, the Republicans were accused of the President in the last days that he had deceived the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relatived his original promise.
"The majority of the citizens who have a working health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the terminations, Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look for a new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus receive a better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"They come a better offer," he said.
The government noted it as surprisingly that the five percent of the population who have completed an insurance would have to surround another rate, since their contract does not conform to the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to directly say to these Americans that they deserve better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the Representatives House in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform has been “miserable” since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as all others," she said.
I'm determined to recover your trust.
This pronouncement of an inflicted Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at the last hearing at the House of Representatives was taken after a discussion with the Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri. It was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the Affordable Care Act's 'architect' did not voluntarily refrain from a state-funded insurance to conclude a price at HealthCare.gov, which she now wanted to sell millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Support
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to American news station CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had attacked an air weapon support point in the Syrian Latakia a day earlier.
The goal had been "rakets and associated equipment" that the Israeli government had feared that they were intended for the Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the support point in the harbour city of Latakia had been shot from Wednesday to Thursday, and the Israelis were responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, on which Russian defense missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles were seen, according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport spring heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters quotes an anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes Israel had executed the attack but was not safe.
A speaker of the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We don't comment on these reports."
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver ground air missiles to the Hisbollah earlier, partly successful.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that every attempt of Syria to provide the Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean that the crossing of a "red line" would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented consent that the US spionage had 'inappropriately gone too far'
With an unexpected consent, John Kerry indicated a disappearance of the US defensive attitude towards their surveillance programmes by saying that in certain cases the spy had ‘inappropriately gone too far’.
The Foreign Minister also admitted that Barack Obama, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for setting on "Autopilot" when the explosive explosions of whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the spying activities of the NSA.
Due to the transmitted information, the US government has moved into a diplomatic storm of disarmament from its allies.
In a speech transmitted by a video connection at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "I and the President and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that have almost expired by autopilot, simply because the ability to go back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War as well as of course to September 11."
As a first high-ranked member of the US Government, he then admitted that the US spionage had exceeded a limit, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, this has gone too far too far."
The President is determined to make clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse takes place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people in this process are not affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives were saved by their monitoring operations.
He added: “We have to do with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed to kill people, blow into the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch it off and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to disperse the concerns against the alleged American spying and convince the Europeans of the need to continue working with the USA in the anti-terror efforts, as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs on Thursday stated.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop taking part in anti-terror organizations because of the frustration of the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is very important for the US's national security interests that the Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism," said Murphy, who sits as a democrat for the first time in the Senate and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes.
Media reports, which recorded millions of telephone data in Europe, have burdened relations with some US associations, although the head of the secret service said this week that the reports were inappropriate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato associations and exchanged with the United States.
Other enthusiasms quoted from documents passed by Snowden that the NSA had monitored the cell phone of Bundeskanzler Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national secret services, James Clapper, defended the spying in allies as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of other participating MEPs should be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route is still being developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some 'intensive words'.
He said that the European governments would have to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programmes that they themselves have used for years.
"While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus protect the rights of Europeans, these must also be seen with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," says Murphy.
At the same time, for John Kerry a trip to the Middle East and Poland will take place in the weekend to deal with the wrath of the US-American strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the U.S. surveillance activities.
The use of Nicolai Müller in the FSV Mainz 05 Bundesliga game at the FC Augsburg threatens to prevent a persistent injury to the jumping joint.
Mainz bounces for a use of Nicolai Müller.

"We will decide on his use in the short term," said Trainer Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have its six hits best gate guards.
For the Mainzers have already to refrain from the injured performance carriers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australians appealed against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days prison in Phuket because she had falsely claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the judgment and was released on deposit.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first charged by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15th, after she had told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men held her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived in her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she knew the story.
Until the court proceedings, she was in police custody on site.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security prison at the edge of Phukets, instead of in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy-Liga who went to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunis explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have her back to Australia.
"Of course, we are very worried, but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible," said Tunis.
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is free to pay a deposit of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports, it was read that in the meantime she makes vacation in the holiday resort of Krabi in South Thailand.
On the side of the court, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand, after the recent murder of the traveling buyer Michelle Smith in Phuket, could be trying to improve his attacked tourist image, and that is why it comes to a free appeal.
