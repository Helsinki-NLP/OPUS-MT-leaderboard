What is it supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech social democrats in Prague do not know a full-minded place, nor the "conditory".
The new councillors of the capital of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the City Representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has taken part of the new Council from the ČSSD a little "stamped down" as they dominate the notorious snake that has inhabited in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were on the rod.
The codated vocabulary, which was introduced by the Prague political elite in the expired era of Mayor Pavel Bém, has been rejected by some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils showed something in the dark with regard to these new terms.
At least they claim that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"No idea."
"I'm rather a newman in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new director of culture, responded to the test of the "Paten-Wortschatze".
But also Mr Karel Březina - a political veteran - responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term "Golfloch".
"That's the only expression of those you're presenting me here, I'm using occasionally."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of snake."
From the vocabulary published by the Actuálně.cz in June this year before the ODS election, the editorial group picked out six words, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The social democrats should define the terms "full-place", "greatest Prague Gulfhole", "go into the conditories", "starsnacken", "treat of the capital" and "bleak".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague's school - promised his participation in the conversation first, but did not even deduct the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how civil democrats talk to each other, I don't judge it."
"For me, how we understand ourselves in the framework of our programmes is important," he argued.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký, in the headline mentioned above, would not have realized that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the Ex-Obermeister Bém, Roman Janoušek was talking about.
Kaucky says nothing at all, and the only term he corrected during the test was "the largest Prague Gulfhole".
"That's the tunnel blanka," says Kaucký, but added to the safety: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokely, "I'm sure I'm going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" is then properly encirculated by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Governor of Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
But both social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and what it says "to go into the conditory".
"I think that it is to go into some Prague gastronomy business," Plachý is quite close to the mystery solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
However, in agreement with Březina, he admires that he had created this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that that vocabulary would be his own.
If the test participants are judged, there seems to be no similar incredible snake among the social democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use shortcuts or nicknames," says the chairman of Prague's ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called Salopp "Hulda" by his party members.
"In school I was called Bříza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me this," tells Karel Březina his nickname.
The Deník Aktuálně.cz newspaper has tried the name and see - it works.
Counsellor Weinert is friendly to the party members of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who made the attention to himself before the elections of the party sponsorship, is called "Igráček" (known Czech Lego-Figur).
Nicknames are the only one to allow the social democrats to use in the inner part of the language.
Hulínský does not supposedly like it if he is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague Chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the Chemical Champion Rights" is said to have to do with that Petr Hulínský has acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "hexes" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped into witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social features.
They belong rather to the older generation, they do not find work - for example for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women becomes "to witch", she is strictly isolated so that she can't become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Mans are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Also young and healthy women remain spared because they are helping to work and bear children," describes an order sister the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home of more than one hundred women who have been emptied by their communities.
The local government now decided to oppose this abnormal "social action".
And for this reason, a brochure was issued that would stop the "hexe sequel".
But the thing's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read", the newspaper "derStandard" pointed to the dilemma of written information.
However, it is also going to be accused of becoming witchcraft in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured them over with petroleum and simply burned them.
The server BBC also reported on this incident.
However, the offenders claimed that the matter would only be a meeting of unhappy circumstances.
According to their version, oil is fired, which is used for ritual anointing.
And after the group had tried to "dive out a evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without regard to their education.
"The standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Friends of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to deteriorate the witch hunt, the Gambian President has, last year, mixed the President himself properly.
"President Yahya Jammeh made a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they were supposed to have a share in their death and would now try to kill the President himself by black magic."
"To this end, he called on Shamane from nearby Guinea to help those who, in companionship of police, soldiers and the President's body guard, deported women and men from Gambian villages, and brought them to the farm of the President in Kanilai," stated the Amnesty International report.
On the farm, the inclined people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only because of the international pressure, the nearly a thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: he is heated in the oven - still pays higher rent
An older entrepreneur leaves the customer center of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebaron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a cardboard with three new rental contracts to three apartments: for its own and the homes of his daughters and his son, who just bans a prison sentence.
All three were increased in the framework of the so-called "deregulation" just the rent.
Instead of 3500 crowns monthly rentals, the son will have a 2-room apartment with a kitchen of the second category 4100 crowns in the next year.
"And there isn't even flowing warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he angryly tipps with the finger on the new lease contract of the son, to whose signature he has a power of power.
"But what - I have signed," he explains half-polluted and half-resigned.
The civil society BytyOKD.cz, which described the new terms of rent as "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December to publish an instruction on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just wins off.
"One says this, the other," he makes a dark face.
The Ostrava region becomes the large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year, this deregulation is ahead of most of the rentals in the Czech Republic, whose tenants are not paying a market-based rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG guard in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning on this Tuesday.
Just next to the door, the bodyguards of a security agency and with her a caller.
"Don't rent 2011", a special keyboard on the touch screen shines.
Shortly tipped and the device already spikes out a numberboard.
We have hardly encoded the number "157" and already pee it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later you'll be on the line.
Something later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room seems not to apply at all the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair applications, insurance matters and similar things.
From mid-November the envelopes, with the new rental contracts, flatter the most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio into the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty proposes an increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special switch for the new rentals in the customer centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch replies after a moment when the "customer" escapes as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining dwellings are a brisant theme.
Before the elections, Parliament's Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD had quite loudly addressed this issue, no wonder today the newspapers are full of it.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even ne besch. WC-brille could change them," the man mentioned in the beginning makes himself air.
Up until now, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly on the switch to convince themselves that they really receive the promised rent reduction that RPG promises to them when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease contract until 15 December are also to come to the enjoyment of a half-reduced february rental.
Until now, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is all but overloaded with demands.
"From yesterday's 360 clients were only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 because of this," the switch officials appreciate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on both its websites and wall panels where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree to the new rent, it is determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach," explains RPG on his websites.
"Nobody goes to court here," says one of RPG Byty's employees, and a man on the street in front of the customer centre gives her at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pensions, of which I stay 5,000 for food, where I should take the money for a court war," he says.
Then the employee becomes uncertain.
"See Male."
"Lord Zaorálek tells them about the media that they shouldn't sign and so the people are still waiting for it," she says.
The regulated rent ends mostly in the Czech Republic to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty according to the increase in rent is an economic necessity.
"The existing level of rent is not even enough for the maintenance of the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - just the negligence of the apartment fund, which is criticized by the tenants infringed, is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to the owners of the house.
While RPG has been able to invest four billion from the hired rentals in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, it is estimated to be 5.2 billion in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the polster seats in the harbour of Havířov, a few red lighting information is always on.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less concern 31 200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Immer means this at most 7.50 CZK per square metre and month", can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only in 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increases the rent by 38 percent.
"In these cases, the increase in rent prices of 19.66 CZK per square metre is extremely lower", RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments, the rental stays at the same height next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation does not push the rents into the height, but takes place gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another commitment: All revenue from the rent increase (see chart) wants to put the company back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in heat deterioration.
But - these are to be primarily benefited by those who sign the agreements on rent increase.
The architects saw one - the office also belongs to a kindergarten
The Avriiopoint office building in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini children's garden here, with all that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available for the employees of Arch.Design since last year.
The projection and architecture office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of renowned Brünen buildings came from the first designs for the new Apriopoint building with the premises for his company mini-children garden.
In a wise outlook, because most of his 90 employees (ins) are in the baby tree age and the company is concerned that the project antennas return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the possibility of shortening the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social programme.
Construction engineers have so much easier to put their demanding profession and child care under a hat.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they have been able to win funding funds from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operation Programme for Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the Czech Republic’s State budget.
Thanks to this funding (subsidy of 2.8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment were provided and for the duration of 2 years qualified staff and operation.
After the utilization of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini-children garden for 3 more years at its own costs.
The preparation of this project took place a whole year, with the Company Economy Rating actively assisted in the implementation of the application.
The children care for fully qualified staff - a nurse and a childgarten teacher, the children's garden can visit children without alternate restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And as it comes to a mini-children's garden, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day is changing over several children.
The kindergarten company is flexiblely adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-children's garden is still comparable to the framework programme of pre-education.
The children do not only play here, but above all they are given excellent lessons - from basic findings to pre-school education, in addition they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer available to the children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive corporate environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus avoid stress in late picking up the children from a far-distanced kindergarten.
The parents therefore use their working time more productively.
No wonder that there are also natural and loyal employer relationships.
Arch.Design thus entered among the Czech companies who offer significant benefits in the acquisition of new employees, which are family friendly and through such programs strengthen their personal marketing.
A bone house is also fascinated after 100 years. See the interiors of Gaudi
The roof is like the back of a prehistoric ice, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are scraped fish millers.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house with its organic forms was named "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of shrubs and widespread soft lines, all these are typical features for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with fantastic lines, tender colors and textures that remember nature and living creatures.
Only when you see more precisely, you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and thoughtful order.
During the night the whole facade works even more plastic, dramatic and special lighting enhances the shine of colors.
The same vibrant lines and swallowed shapes also dominate the inside of the house.
Wellen-shaped wood copies the window frames, lands, ornamental elements of doors, even guck holes and beads.
The Batlló house in the district of Eixample on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia Nr. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, originally stood on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batlló rental house did not create Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Especially on its rice board, the decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate owner and also the use of mosaics at the facade were his idea.
However, many other artists and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fertile cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in Park Güell, where there are also other works from Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after his completion, the house was won by the local residents of its organic forms because of the nickname "Knochenhaus".
In turn, others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "according house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of Saint Georg, the cartridge of Catalonia.
But other sculpture elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed for the house a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the time.
Something bizarre already murmurs her 45 degree tendency.
During his creation, Gaudí consistently ignored all the construction regulations at that time and by no means had to do with them.
Before the start of construction, he obtained the corresponding construction permit from the city, but the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, the city fathers were so horrified at the completion that they requested remedy.
Among other things, the Council also opposed the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public citizenship.
However, there was no longer any change, at the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the city district, Josep Batlló made an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and she was prompted to him.
The owner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the 2nd floor gallery was a company salon, on the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment were located.
The ground floor was paved to a jewelry business.
The entire six-story building runs through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
By the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were removed and replaced by curved and swayed walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of rooms.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salont doors and thus a larger society could easily plaud without having to refrain from some intimacy in confidential conversations.
The house received by Gaudí's reconstruction except a new façade also a quite unusual roof and two other floors.
Impressive is also Gaudí's game with the light as well as the blue and white glassed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the hobs.
The game of these two colors gives a maximum level of light to all floors of the house.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The Casa Batlló house, which was included in the Unesco World Heritage List in 2005, can visit everyone today.
On the first floor the most spacious and most beautiful apartment is made available to the public.
Only in the year, the owners of the house decided to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were kept, and they were extended to other common and roof floor rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building monument is not a doll, it is 16.50 Euro, students, pensioners, groups and owners of tourist tickets get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices at other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Those who want to meet the real atmosphere of the house with their dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rose? Women have different wishes than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the ground floor - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be harmoniously complemented in order to meet the needs of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the health condition and not least the sex of the slepper.
Just as important is the interior in which mattress and rust have been subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house that is not regularly heated, latex matrates are not well suited, as they need much longer to "were warm".
In addition, they are considerably heavyer than usual polyurethane matrates.
And - they should be used regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation channels in the core and still lie on a solid plate, humidity is attested: so it is not excluded that it is under its mould.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layers are common, will hardly be used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Even though all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"They simply need a soft layer of Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam - a Form Memorial Polymer) for their wounded shoulders, heels and hips."
"I also recommend, among other things, those who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system so that they can badly receive the "information" from the joints and the skin," says Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in polsterm oils.
That's why I've already bought many ice hockey players, but also other customers these mattresses with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem because such mattresses offer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico, among other things."
And you don't have to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the advantages of the Visco scum.
This "wonder" actually works very easy.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise, it swallows itself to the warm body.
Nowhere does it mean, in the night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The vis-coolastic foam also offers protection from decubitus.
When selecting the mattress size, you should still add the length of the foot soles to the body size, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who is 180 cm tall, needs a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeve should be available at least 90 cm wide, i.e. 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comfort is half more and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal width of bed: "If you are on the back, you should still be enough space for the lightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the winning master of the Polsters and Space Equipmenters, who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture and also presents this topic to specialist schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs its own rust and its own mattresses, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains left but to mount the roast at different heights and that is not possible at all bed frames.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be found on the shape layer and the fine polster.
"Don't feel the feathers with your hand or when you put them down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully padded beds with mattress and underground like grown Siamzwills have nothing to find in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated, and the reference cannot be washed, what is already going on today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress will slowly become a huge (and concealed seven) after five to seven years.
As a result, experts also reject advertising logs that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even life-long warranty in matratzen.
Every thing has her if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, the hygiene of washable, detractable belts should not be shy, yet it is recommended to use a mattress shoe that can easily be washed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are usually made with round zipper closure today, so you get two halfs after opening (in essence for washing and washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often acts like the inequal struggle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a roast?
Get out of it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for one night.
Likewise, they would prefer to use the plate with ventilation holes (if there are no in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine-polsters.
Polyurethane matrates are not included on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (or combinations of latex and coconuts) are suitable for non-adjustable stainless steels with 14 to 18 feathers (Lamellens) and are always paying rosters with a larger number of latitudes, i.e. 28 and more springs, with lordosen support in the Lendenwirbel area and the possibility of regulating the latten hardness.
No mattresses with feather skeleton are included on adjustable roasts, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffs of the springs, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This concerns a special attachment of the feathers, which enables you to press or tilt the springs in such a way as to allow the punctual insinking of the shoulder of the sleeve.
On the contrary, for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "heren mattrates".
It is also thought of the ladies - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-lastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or roast with point-lastic contact paths with so-called multi-torsion feathers are determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (to large and full) head cushion for the right mattress and right rust, most benefits are lost again.
Here too a fist rule: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the school-term buckets can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm pillow appears, as the Scandinavians like.
In the side position, the head cushion (together with the shoulder discharge zone in the rust or soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have meant with the original (heu-filled) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers use more and more natural materials or at least their amplifications.
Matratzen also means the new magic word "Bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, it is used to produce polyurethane foams increasingly natural oils - for example, ricino- and soybean oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is the name of matratzen, which consists of materials purely of natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance when sleeping.
Here too one makes a difference between man and woman.
While the men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, the bearings for women have "heated" effect.
Extraktes from red pepper shots stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Matratzen of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffs (hardness) of chickens and visco foams create multi-son matrates that know exactly where head, hips and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, one has 7000 crowns and more.
However, health carpets are usually burdened with lower VAT, since they are considered to be a medical aid.
Gumotex was granted this advantage as the first Czech company.
One sees saving the mattress and the rust is not so easy.
Sometimes there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses at the price of one.
Thus, the brand Magniflex offers the mattress duofreeze with rigged Visco-Schaum Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one gets free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoalastic foams with open cell structure and high density in nearly cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the start.
Tempur becomes soft at heat, in cool environment it retains itself.
Thus it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure optimally.
It is therefore not only ideal to prevent pressure fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoal foams are used not only for mattresses but also for other health products, such as for special pedestrians to facilitate legs and vessels.
Indigenous manufacturers, for example, use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to control the kids
The fear of your own children grows and thus considers more and more parents to monitor them by GPS.
The system, originally invented for cars, can be just as good people, which would also be helpful in such cases as recently when the nine-year-old Anička Janatková disappeared.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it should not be larger than a bracelet clock.
Many people have put the case of the disappeared Anička into fear and fear, so they look forward to means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairment of their privacy.
"We strive to tell everyone that this is not about herum pioneering, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood that it comes to the tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS location devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that, in particular, there can be misuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in your pocket without knowing it, but we haven't had any such case yet."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
He believes, however, that the child should always know what purpose the "chess" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, children's psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear such a thing, it just gets rid of him.
"Also very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they do not want to be controlled."
"Soon the mobile phones brought great expectations with the parents, but they can be switched off as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Mrs Bočková.
In their view, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"With planned kidnappers, the kidnapper almost always controls whether the child has any electronics with which it could be placed."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such surveillance devices were more widely used, they would also seek them, as their sale would be safely accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always a step forward," says the psychologist.
However, it admits that similar devices can be very helpful in a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Roberta Čech, from the company RC Monitoring, which offers placement services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can also help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals."
"Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, an inclination measure is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and stay unmoved, the device immediately sends a warning with the indication of the position," claims Mr. Čech.
He believes that similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to play a special software.
The problem of the current placement equipment is that it is either equipment in string wooden box size, similar to the trailers or smaller phones.
There's always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin of the Macro Because, in the present time we are testing devices that look like normal digital watches.
"This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize that it is a surveillance or positioning device.
"Or he notices that only after some time what the police give a time ahead," he adds.
No matter in what direction the development goes - to armbands or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So the combination of placement function using the GPS system (such as the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could turn around all of the Czech Republic but only two years
The Czech Army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition torque, with plungers.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition to the army camps.
It is already soothing to know that the forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition door - two, but not more than four years.
The army bought the ignition door from the share company STV Group, e.g. for lush 40 million crowns.
In his reason for purchasing this huge amount of ignition, MF DNES General Steel replied that the soldiers would consume at the 60 kilometres of ignition every year.
According to the searches of military pyrotechnics, which MF DNES addressed, this indication indicates that the whole army would have to complete very intensive pyrotechnical training every year – from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not excluded.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition doors be justified halfway.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that to the training of each new professional soldier is fully sufficient for two meters of ignition, then the army has created a calming stock for the 225 years already mentioned, even in the light of the increased needs of the pioneer and special units.
Soldiers of the fast-use brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense of Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting practices of the missing means are severely restricted.
To be silent from the lack of underwear.
"I don't enter why they're buying a lot of ignorance from us."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer we want to meet as a dealer," says STV Group Jan Děcký's sales manager.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defense, founds the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of ignition in order that the army would have been covered with this "munition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year period of use of the ignition and police and army pyro technicians only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four mentioned years are also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed, in order not to be accused of the criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the term of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and not threatening the lives of the soldiers.
But these tests are not for nothing, but cost more money.
Another argument from the Ministry of Defense is the quantitative discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition.
"They cost us sixty percent less than the last 244 kilometres of delivery," spokesman Pejšek informs us of the position of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: The annual consumption of pyrotechnic ignors of the police, the munition from World War II or the Soviet brother’s arms has been almost 1,500 metres over for a number of years.
And the police always order such quantities of this ammunition that it can consume before the end of the period of use.
As a result of the safety of the pyro technicians, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus reliable ignition cords is also open.
Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defense has huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from times of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand people of Czechoslovakia prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the Pyro technicians who addressed MF DNES, the Czech troops are expecting the same problem in a few years in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of ignition, which it has bought today so "favorable".
To date, the contacts I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious placement in the competition "Small entrepreneurs of the Year" helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Lucáš Pytloun was winner of the last year's competition "Small entrepreneur of the Year" from Liberec.
The story of his success is like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there was no good overnight opportunities at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad and using a bank credit he created a building house with five apartments.
Remember that he was a university student at the time in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous task.
"The then price-quality ratio annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit into the house, which he then rebuilt step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have also signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé to which we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties at the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already reported themselves," says entrepreneur number One of the previous year.
"Great share in this license sale for the operation of hotels has just had the victory in the competition "entrepreneurs of the year," Mr Pytloun adds awarding.
The victory has brought him greater acquaintance, yes popularity in Liberec and surroundings.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they congratulated me even afterwards, and I have to say that did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend to all who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't need to win right away, every visualization is good.
He says that he has benefited from the contacts and acquaintances that otherwise would not have come.
"With some people I have met thanks to the competition, I have regular business relations to this day."
The fame associated with the success is, in his opinion, also a little down on each of his employees.
And he's got the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that will be granted to general recognition."
I do not really see this as a personal success, no, that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just something in the foreground," says Lukáš Pytloun modest.
I wish my followers a more quiet year than we had it in Farmet
The victory souphoria was quickly dissolved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind itself.
The prize for the first rank of the Vodafone Company of the year last year took Karel ŽŽárský, the farmet company owner.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made from the small tool building in Česká Skalice to stamp a company from the ground that makes hundreds of millions of turnovers.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encouraged me myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history, the effort was to do something useful.
And when the state offered a small workshop to his father, Karel Ž
Shortly later, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years they have risen to the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only through the success in the above competition and its medialization it has also entered into the consciousness of non-competition.
"Not only that our customers now see the Farmet brand considerably more intensely, our foreign partners also began working together with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country to add greater value," says Karel ŽŽárský.
Last year, however, farmet was not only the sign of victory.
The assessment was due to the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time shaking the citizens, but especially companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"Of course we couldn't miss this situation."
"The turnover decreased by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even take it into dismisses," explains Karel ŽŽárský
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But it was managed to handle the situation and keep the company in black figures, even if with less profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to withdraw - in the case of investment in research and development.
"We built out of the grant a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Ž
Everything is evidence that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnovers are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a quieter atmosphere," says Karel ŽŽárský.
An opinion survey cleared by unfair rules
The opinion survey on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneur competition for the fourth time.
Some rude rules have already been able to get out of the world.
To the doubtful winner of the next year's survey "Absurdity of the Year" the obligation to create documents to authorities available online.
More than one third of not four thousand entrepreneurs decided to vote.
Thus, the Social Insurance Board requested a paper extract from the trade register, even if the official had been able to pick it up by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion survey, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require any excerpts from the trade register in future in case of social security payers' checks," said the spokesperson of ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose and purpose of the opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all the regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to fulfil and to lift the crazy ones.
This year, for the fourth time, is part of an entrepreneur's competition organised by the HN (HN) and enjoyed a growing popularity in the public.
If the three thousand people participated in the vote last year, they were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hinder business activity.
"As regards, for example, the number of income tax forms, we take a higher rank in the world," says Karel Havlíček of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and business managers of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurship in recent years is the proclaimed objective of all governments.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank's data, Czech Republic takes the 74th rank in terms of business conditions, compared with the previous year, one with eight lower placements.
The competition Absurdity of the year was first called in the year and plays each year after the same scenario.
Everyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the editorial conclusion of the competition at the end of September.
To register, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the organiser of the competition searches for seven candidates for the "anti prize" and allows the public to vote on the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It victorys the absurdity that most of the votes get.
For this year's opinion survey, more than a hundred, more precisely 105 meaningless regulations and regulations have been notified.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition, for example, are provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways must be paid toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must provide every two years.
The list of this year's "seven" is published on the sides of the competition.
The call for competition at the Prag Wenzelsplatz at the beginning of November is part of a happening, which also regularly participates in political and public life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the association of small or medium-sized enterprises and commercial operators of the Czech Republic and Petr Kužel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic at the highlight of competition with the party.
"Where the state throws the entrepreneurs crumbs between the legs, there can be no real economic recovery, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessarily difficult for entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister for Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create mad arrangements from the world show effect.
In 2007, the most entrepreneurs were disturbing the duty to report to the commercial office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intent to want to travel to an exhibition stand or to Kirmes.
This obligation was repealed by a novel of the Commercial Law.
The obligation to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report services to the Working Office of employees for up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
In 2009, the regulation, which imposed physiotherapists, was elected to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger risks in the speaker room.
This Regulation was somewhat mildened by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator duty was lost.
A new category honours societally responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fiveth anniversary of the competition of the Economic News (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
"We want to support such companies who are aware of the consequences of your entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of Vodafon, the caller and warrant of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the Year".
To this year's first year of this special subcategory of Vodafon Company's main competition, companies registered, for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspirational and boasting enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically with regard to the subject matter of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This concerns, for example, disabled people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which does not promote the formation of formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, who has been the main sponsor of a Foundation Fund for Disabled Children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also takes care of its healthly handicapped employees, who make up 70 percent of their employees, for which she was recognised with the title "Responsible Company of the Region of Central Bohemia", and in competition with Vodafone Company of the year, she occupied the third rank within this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft conquered, including a flowing and also reduced to an average of 35 hours a week and this without proportional wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company purchases mainly from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its environment and works in accordance with environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimise the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration for the environment," explains Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem, in turn, is located in the health of his employees, and therefore it has acquired them to all notebooks ergonomic armchairs and keyboards, and it also promotes homework in its employees and in business operations it uses Carting services which are offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Emergency", which provides concrete assistance to the Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, representative of the company.
Not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlsbad region is worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
"We provide our employees with contributions to food, working path, increasing their qualifications and holidays," says Josef Strapáč, from the Baufirma Czasch from Bruntál, the winner of the Moravian-Sleesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year, all districtfinalists of the Vodafon Company of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire submitted to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competitors failed to answer the questions, they were excluded from the competition "responsible company of the year", but in the main competition Vodafone company of the year, they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration only on this competition is not possible, since it is only a subcategory of the company's main competition of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anticorruption police took arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was deducted from the detectives in handcuffs.
This claimed to have tried to manipulate a just-going public competition for the settlement of refund claims in such a way that the property offered in competition would be a specific interested person.
This is said to have paid Luboš G. for this half a million.
"I can only confirm at this time that the police are persecuting a person because of the delicacy of fraudulent crafts in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, Chief of the Pilsner State Prosecutor of the newspaper "Právo", she could not grant further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police.
In what way he could manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in view of the fragile official information.
The spokesman of the Lubomír Černá soil fund pointed out the question of Právo that the police had actually arrested in the Pilsner side of the soil fund and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and not about one of our employees," she conceived.
According to the public competition, Ms Černá had the correct name "Requirement to offer claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the Bodengesetz" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the land offered.
"These persons, in the context of the call, offer a higher value of their refund claims to be compensated by the transfer, than the exempted property value."
"According to the requirements offered, the order of potential acquires is determined, then the ground funds transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the Sponsor of the Fund.
Luboš G. was obviously available information, who had registered on the call and since he was entitled himself, as he had bought a number of refund claims, he offered a real estate interest that he would withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat refinement.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money in his arrest.
Luboš G. had too good contacts with the Pilsner soil fund in the past.
So he also played a role in the Causa of the former head of the Václav Sankota soil fund, which was criminally persecuted because he issued lands in spare refunds to which location decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G., for example, purchased land intended for building public roads, more precisely where the construction of the access magnets was planned for the Borské pole industry area.
Later, he invented these very favorablely with the Magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the property.
At that time, the town hall had to pitch the hard heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the lands.
The housing costs of the households increase by a few hundred per month
Households have to expect not only higher costs for all types of energy from January, but also higher water and wastewater charges and for remote heating and some places also grow rents.
Since January, families will have to pull several hundred crowns more from the wallet monthly than before.
Electricity is up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and some places also deserve remote heat delivery.
Only the electricity expenditure costs the housing households several hundred crowns per year.
The current prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers, so the debt is the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, in particular from photovoltaic plants.
Gas is only getting moderately more expensive, but it is precisely when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here too, there are a few hundred crowns more to be expected per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for remote heat from city to city vary.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more for remote heat monthly up to 50 crowns, more than 1000 crowns pay more per year families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague are threatening 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague continues to be one of the lowest in comparison with the whole of the Czech Republic.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges are to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, in 140,000 rentals, the so-called rental regulation will be expected to be taken away from January.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by a hundred percent from January.
If you do not agree with this lease, the company wants to take judicial interests.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with Fernet and Rum Beer is out - it just works too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also a good whisky, which one stole the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after which drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen need to be treated most frequently.
No exception are children who have to sleep their cats repeatedly in the hospital.
This is reflected in the experiences of doctors faced with similar cases in the reception of the children's departments of clinics.
"Bier or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long until you're drunk."
"The trend today is clearly heavy alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief of the Children's Department in the Middle Bohemian clinic of Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it is possible to escape the father a bottle from the house bar, and if not, at least Fernet or Vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage that you can mix him with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him a right.
"The most common thing is Fernet or rum."
"This is today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"Slibowitz, who is taken from home, was also the subject of Slibowitz," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to the chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital hospitalization are no exceptional appearance.
Before the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Paeditrie Department of the Hospital Motol, where the rescue cars drunk pupils from near and distance.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began at the age of 12, when she was first delivered with 3.5 promille alcohol in the blood and in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at the exhibition site in Holešovice on any dance party."
"The interesting thing was that her mother didn't seem strange that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," wonders the chief.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when infringing with their own sprayers is considered to be one of the main causes of growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, a real dependency in the true sense of the word is not the case with children.
"Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependency on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who enjoy alcohol repeatedly, mostly a negative family-social background is characteristic," explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to the spokesman of the Motol Hospital, Ms. Jurinová, some 40 drunk children were assigned to the local department for child and youth medicine by mid-November.
However, only cases with heavy alcohol poisoning that required hospital stay are included in statistics.
Drunken children who are brought home by the parents after ambulant treatment or, where appropriate, by the police are not registered.
Apart from the cases in which children only drink such a bottle of scraps in the school bank, Mr. Pelikán believes there are three annual amplitudes on which a hundred percent is left: Walpurgis night, New Year’s New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"The last one for two reasons - either because of grief because of the bad testimony or for joy on holidays."
"I have experienced seven drunk children at once during the Walpurgis night," said Dr. Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to fight with an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches of the morning afterwards, which are affected by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be distributed in the hospital with a liquid infusion with glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
"They're obviously better off, because after the "gorgeous" experience in the evening, they wake up with good mood without hurting somewhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Dr. Pelikán, in which he sometimes corrupts the patient’s good mood by telling them the costs she'll cost the treatment.
Because the transportation with the rescue car and the night in an acout bed come well and gladly on a few thousand crowns.
"Within and again I used this as an educational tool when I preceded directly to the children at the visit, what cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays over to earn the money for one such fet," added Dr. Pelikán.
However, his opinion is that the health insurance companies do not take regression procedures to demand the costs necessary for the healing of the drunk children by the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hand - in Spain
Two light fighting aircraft L-159 from a total of five who exchanged the Czech Ministry of Defense against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
They have so far only been seen in manövers or flight shows.
It is about the two-seater version L-159T1 operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are single L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the agent of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken it over last week.
When she expedes the aircraft physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defense, is not yet known.
In turn, the one-sided fighting aircraft L-159 were separated from long-term stored aircraft and this was without further deposits and investments from the department's reserve.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in the current state and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to get out without two-seat fighting aircraft, since the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 on the reconstruction of four superfluous L-159 to the two-sixth version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second plane wants to take over until the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to enforce the fighting aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the Treaty, it is clear and clear that the company is EADS customers of aircraft L-159 and that they should be used to train pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore the case of the buyer, in what way he realises the matter," said Pejšek.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange trade of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns last year had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defense had not written a tender procedure for the purchase, but directly addressed EADS.
The defence office then argued that this exchange would support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army purchased Aero 72 machines, from which she used only 24, the rest she wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa planes would also have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission, in fact, defended the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last one is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer pointing finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose pointing finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is supposed to be related to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer and this, in particular, for men to sixty", said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the cancer research institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be subject to a prostate cancer test, especially when there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, adds Mrs Eeles.
During the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain pursued more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
For more than half of the participants in the study, the right-hand finger was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men the likelihood of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of the men whose ring and pointing fingers were equal.
However, in men whose pointing finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, in men up to 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned above, which are already in prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of gender hormones that the child was exposed to in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer pointing finger.
Earlier research revealed that the testosterone is accelerating the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said that he was familiar with this study, yet he did not consider the relationship between the finger length and the cancer risk to date "completely proved".
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like the largest part of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the streets and walkways lies mostly tight snow, the winter servants were on the axis all night in many places.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague.
This said Novinky.CZ of the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto club (ÚAMK).
At kilometres 91, a truck crashed, at kilometres 93, two trucks collapsed, with this accident there are injured people.
A few cars are also in the street graves.
There are also problems at kilometres 185 of the motorway D1 towards Prague.
Two trucks have also collapsed here.
The drivers should leave by kilometres of 190 or drive over Brno and get up at kilometres of 182 to the town of Kývalka.
There are kilometers of studs.
Also on the D11, an accident has happened, and that is exactly the case when we travel to Prague.
In Prague itself is a several centimeter thick snow ceiling and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Car colons, for example, form in the district of Prosek, also the street Štěrboholská is completely obscured.
The safest means of transport are in any case the metro.
The trams drive with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peaceplace.
At 8:00 a.m., the Prague Crisis Stage meets.
There are also problems in the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast train connections because of snow confusions.
For example, there are problems on the Prague route - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should need to inform themselves about the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed since Wednesday 11 o'clock at night until 5 o'clock in the morning.
Most streets in South Morning are only with increased caution accessible.
To Vyškov three side streets are completely inaccessible, in the vicinity of Brno, some snow confusions form and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow milling on some higher streets.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely locked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here too, you will need to use snow-saving milling.
When they get fable again, they can't be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of white carpaths.
On the streets, which can only be scattered with inert seeds for natural protection reasons, is one to five inches of thick snow ceiling, led ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of new snow fell, mostly in northern Bohemia - some to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Sleesian region, up to 15 centimeters of new snow fell.
But in the Czech Republic it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
The American troops used a new "intelligent" weapon for the first time in Afghanistan, which is so far known only under their code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and move the force relationship for their benefit.
The new gun is something like a super-suite cannon.
Their projectiles are guided to the target by laser with a meeting security of just a few meters.
The special collars of caliber 25 mm, which have been developed for this gun and which contain highly explosive explosive fuel, work practically like small granates.
The shots can be programmed in such a way that they can explode at any point of their ballistic aerodrome, not only when they rise to the target.
This means that they can be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the shelter.
From above it is usually not protected, so the mortal steel fragmented rain from above can easily exclude it from fighting.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new fighting weapon is the first infantry weapon that makes itself use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier goes basically like this: he looks at the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he wins a precise visibility point after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to print it.
"Let's say you've measured 543 m."
"When you press, the gun is charged and shoots the gun to the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being shifted
The company Fujitsu moved its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their work from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu moved its office in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry series specialized on computers and their maintenance informed on Wednesday, in July next year, 400 women and men will move their jobs from the previous office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg in the Astro Park, which is a large office complex on the Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokesperson from Fujitsu explained that there should be another 100 jobs in the Group in the medium term, which were previously distributed to the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the large-scale offices in the Astro Park were more likely to meet the functioning of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu had been only a tenant.
The managing director Bernd Wagner said: "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment of the losers.
The Frankfurt Economic Decent Markus Frank (CDU) said that it was once again a "Global Player".
This is a "great location confession".
Fujitsu passes to the city that the settlement is an important pulse for lower wheels.
The Bad Homburg mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city had been informed early by the management of the intention.
"We have, of course, offered our help to the company," said Korwisi.
However, friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at Mariebader Platz.
Finally, economic reasons would have given rise.
Now it is about preventing a long empty position in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the Town Hall and the neighbouring "Small Vertical" were one of the most controversial construction projects in the Kurstadt with the other buildings at the Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
A joint project of the city and a private project developer was created between the station and the town hall and a new city centre, which provided criticism both for the massive construction of the areas used before partly as a parking area and for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, launch Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected with Siemens, obtained the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were purchased in 2006 by the Frankfurt Deutsche Immobilien-Kanzen-Gruppe along with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid one year later.
The Fujitsu consumers in Tokyo call themselves the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but much more employees count Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, Fujitsu Technology Solutions is a subsidiary in Frankfurt-Niederrad, and the other subsidiaries at this site are intended to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, the Astro Park office has rented 7000 square meters.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped base frame - the Central Association of Electrical Technology and Electronics Industry has its seat.
Amazon blocks server - threats against assanges
Wikileaks is increasingly in distress.
The Amazon Internet service provider has banned the revealing platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is a political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks-Grunder Assange is supposed to stay in England.
The Wikileaks enthusiastic platform is becoming more and more under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
The prominent American senator Joe Lieberman, however, called other countries and companies to the Boykott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileak's founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol flag list, is supposed to stay in the UK according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks is pushed by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the Free", the enthusiastic activists informed Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Recently, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had accessed the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to handle the high access numbers to the documents when publishing the secret diplomatic defences.
By Twitter, Wikileaks added to the step forward: "Excellent - our dollars are now spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they must stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using his servers by Wikileaks, after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had employed research, CNN reported on the Office of Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a Boykott, reports the British "Guardian".
"I would have wished Amazon to take this measure earlier in view of previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to refuse the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, immense and remarkable approach puts our national security at risk and threatens around the globe of life," said a senator's communication.
"No responsible company - whether American or Australian - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to spread stolen material."
Wikileaks-Gründer Assange, searched for by the authorities in Sweden for rape suspects, stands on the Interpol flag list.
According to a report from the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australians in the UK keep themselves aware of Scotland Yard's exact location.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as the intrigue of its opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange fears his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had requested that the responsible for Wikileak's explosions be accused and executed for betrayal.
In Canada, a consultant by head of government said Stephen Harper - obviously ironic - on television, assanges should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, there was a drop exchange.
The spokesman of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "shameful and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently known spionage requests to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we take care of the opinion of a guy with a website," says Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The American government now puts the protection of its databases to the test level.
As a Special Representative, the Vice Director of the Center for Anti-Terror Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House informed.
Travers were responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms", which had become necessary after the release of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that they would be in danger of the security of dissidents and active ones through the Wikileaks publication.
"We did everything to contact them," said Foreign Office speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that should be necessary."
The Ice University
At "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice conditors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the Gelatier and from the Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German a little old of the ice conditor, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
The Gelataio picks the ice cream from the cooling floor with a spray, stretches it into the wafer and then sells it.
To know that, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, he does not pass the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-university has established the manufacturer of ice machinery in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest access and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several day special courses around chocolate ice and internships in the home ice cream.
Some in the Midlife crisis dream of a new career, others just dare to the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil from Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial Ice Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a company consultant and wants to get something own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice cream in her bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because their children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Partner Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
Decisive not only is good taste, but also the silent simplicity and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget the cream of the national and even Southern reconstruction during his training: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romantics."
The first step to production seems quite simple.
Luciano chips the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools immediately to four degrees.
Then he turns up a crochet on the machine and comes out a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice varieties.
Immediately, the lecturer is surprised with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you leave your own appetite of experiment?
Luciano warns against being misled by the spirit of time.
Anyone who speaks of ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guarboon yarn flour.
Of course you can make ice without a stabilizer, only must it be sold within one day, otherwise it sucks together, and the customer bites on loud ice grains.
Some variations to the basic mass are allowed.
It's going to be fun with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit division or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"Suppliers will all try to turn to you dozens of aromatized additives."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which with eggs becomes yellow cream and with cocoa powder for the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the course participants are allowed to go to the ice machinery.
Luciano allows them to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocca and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aromas or other natural additions.
The same experiment is also subjected to the fruit ice species.
More flavouring substances, more fruit purse - tasteful is not necessarily better.
Haselnus ice does not necessarily taste more nuiser if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice creates the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mix highlights the taste of a Gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Eishing is a computation task: If Pfirsich purse is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extra percentage of sugar is required for lemon ice.
Luciano produces a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winters thus measure the oxle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the machinery.
Making ice does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only helps the device for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation despite, little pans aren't left out.
The Brazilian Gustavo tightens himself and his classmates from top to bottom with fruit purse, when the over-dimensional rod mixer droves him out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's just a question of time until something like this happens."
Controllers in onion light
The European Food Authority Efsa was undermined by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This argument is now formulated by the Expert Group Testbiotech, which is understood as an independent Institute for the Effect Assessment of Biotech.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," said Testbiotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert for years were also under contract at the Ilsi lobbyist association.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has contributed substantially to the Efsa testing rules for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, then criticized.
The Efsa regulations are deliberately in line with Ilsi's position papers and thus deceive the manuscript of industry, which is actually to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech contends with a conflict of interest.
Thus, a high-ranking Efsa manager has recently changed the pages without conditions or transition time to the Swiss Agricultural Group Syngenta.
The Central German Radio (MDR) has also recently revealed personal connections between controlling EU authorities and industrial lobbys, which has made the Agency of the Environment and EU Parliament clear.
However, the Efsa cannot detect any conflict of interest.
One can react to all serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high technical quality, says an opinion.
The experts working for Efsa do not require that they have any contacts with the industry.
But they'd have to reveal these.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This itself describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics, including for the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobby order.
In this case, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently authorised without any feeding attempt in animals and the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, makes genetically modified maize on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins but not the whole gene plant, which does not deliver reliable results.
"If you don't seek the risks, how can you find them?" then complains.
Angelika Hilbeck also looks like that.
The scientist has been researching genetic technology since 1994 and is currently working at Zurich University of Technology.
The industry in this area, as in the USA, is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who aren't confused with Groups.
Critical studies would usually not be published for companies.
"The industry controls security research," says Hilbeck.
The track of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was forming Stuttgart station, the tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It cut.
The story is known: in September the excavators were approached and began to break a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: Zig thousands demonstrated against S21, the milliard degradation of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, a large part of the wing was in ruins.
Cracked in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer shell lime, a soft rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got some of the breaks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't leave."
He swarms: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and conceivable."
When he sucked one, he smelled for cigarettes.
He doesn't know what he's gonna do with the breaks yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The track of the Stuttgart stones leads to a forest at Tübingen on a former munition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone range.
The 44-year-old acts with old stones.
He bought all those who drove up at the abriss in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be mealed to rockets or disappear in the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden booth that once was a wardrobe.
He was shamed and threatened when in September he was in the newspapers that he bought the rest of the northern wing from the canceller.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the abbreviation.
And once it happens, it is the most reasonable if the stones were used on.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the 80 kilos heavy quader, piece price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, but some also in the hope of returning him in a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought Rongen, 25 large truck charges.
About half still stores in the forest, the rest has long been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardener, house builder.
They would have come from everywhere and have dragged away what could carry suitcases and trailers.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long turned into "Mäuerle" or in restrictions of herbal bones.
" Actually, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He climbs into his terrain car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of empire.
He studied and canceled, later biology, then he was interested in computers and eventually became stone dealers.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany he collects his treasures.
He says he is the largest old-stone dealer in the Republic.
He's braking.
In the snow there are artificially carved sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresdner Marien Bridge," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
It's going up the way through the forest.
It points to a lot: red sandstone, former part of the Karlsruhe station.
And continue.
"Beautiful travertin."
The quaders once belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckar Stadium.
Overall in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from St. Blasia Dom, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple bottlenecks and oxen cars, it becomes quite awesome.
"It would be a scandal if you were to shredder such a thing."
He hasn't become rich, not stoneful at all.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today, and also in the top of the forest, a sculptor, a smith, a glass bladder and a gardener have left themselves.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," says the restorator.
He's gonna have to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to save.
Talent struggle for high potentials
There's a regular Andrang on the buffet.
16 students press for salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the machine-building and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to get to know with VW developers about the car of the future - and along with Volkswagen.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies are now entering close struggles and, such as VW, are working on cooperation with universities.
Her mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the hearing halls before they come to the labour market and are recruited by others.
And since the universities don't issue any statements about the performance of their students, the exceptional talents are tried to see and bind in practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group throws around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ball pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig cares for the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: "The students enter into contact with the industry and gather experience."
"VW can at the same time get to know students, look at interesting candidates closer and consider who would be in question as an employee."
Such cooperations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
New is that the students are so offensively buried.
"Sometimes the focus was on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably become even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
With the exception of which they have to pay for themselves and especially for highly qualified workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will grow even larger according to VDI forecasts.
For the KPMG economic audit and consulting company, novel Dykta goes on to the talent hunt.
He organizes complex recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern snitzel hunt, where participants must find their way on the basis of GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can look at KPMG companies and meet the company.
Those who are allowed to take a decision in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of many applicants fly into the USA.
The protectors, according to Dykta, are growing increasingly at the hikes and steaking around the high potentials at the universities.
"We want to get rid of the mass with the race."
"Only a simple sailing session was too little."
For talent hunters Dykta seems to be the invoice.
"We have contact with all participants of a similar action last year."
"Some are shortly before their conclusion and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct boiling at the campus, small and medium-sized companies also go to the pirsch very classical at professional measurements.
"We try to reach graduates at expert measurements."
"Etwa on the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, staff manager of the Solar World Solar Technology Manufacturer.
The Bonner company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stubble knows about the childhood problem.
At present, 35 posts are available on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy venue positions."
"That takes a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors indicate that you can make internships with us or write his diploma work."
The solar specialists do not claim expensive advertising operations.
For this purpose, the company tries to advertise with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
"A large group can often not offer this," says staff manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job searching.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good rising opportunities are further crucial factors.
Solarworld occupied 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study at the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute creates an annual top list of German employers.
To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the conditions for employees.
Staff manager Stübe also hopes that the placement of the job seekers will be awarded pluspoints.
"I think that applicants are looking for external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers about more authenticity.
And that means, according to warriors, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as a employer leads over its own employees," he says.
In the sectoral year, the internal employee Branding, i.e. employer trademark education within his own staff.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you handle your people well and identify them with the company, they would accommodate all of them with friends and acquaintances for their employer.
"That's like a game with bande," said Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drills
Before the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drills in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been adopted by the Government in Washington - and thus finally revoke its previous plans.
New drilling remains previously forbidden before the Atlantic Coast.
This was informed by Minister of Interior Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drill platform in April is trigger for the strict prohibition that will apply for at least five years.
Before the unfortune that eleven workers killed and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico on pressure from opposition and industry.
The supporters thus want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Whoever is responsible for the devastating oil fever in the Gulf is not finally cleared to this day.
The criticism is the center of the UK energy group BP, which is faced with billions of demands.
In the course of December, an Inquiry Commission on Obamas will present its results.
In October Ken Salazar had lifted the drill stop imposed after the explosion.
Afterwards, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drill projects.
With stronger controls and more stringent security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new disaster.
Currently, the competent supervisory authority, which had been in dispute after numerous corruption claims, is fundamentally reformed.
At the same time, Obama announced to close lucrative pollutants for oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of funding in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before by stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the largest brake for the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a current industry survey by the consultant company BDO - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be suspended up to further - to reduce growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of raw oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari's right.
"Don't beat you," the ecoactivist calms the journalists: "You will still get enough oil mud from the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to illuminate a boy who is lying up to the chest in the water with the graces surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water gloss, the scene is almost beautiful.
It is not possible to see that under the surface brown oil sweating.
Earlier she collected shrimps here, Esther Badom tells on the shore of the Bodo-Jetty fleet.
Meanwhile, the slow flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, a roasted pipeline brought a lot of raw oil into the vast moisture area.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to rod six hours to reach fish-resistant waters: The Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Nigerdelta, is considered to be one of the worst ruined regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangroven mumps passed by river flows, the whole extent of devastation becomes cautious.
Instead of light water, the motorboat grows brown brews, who dives his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees rage like black larvae rods from the ground, sadly let the palm trees to be found together hang their weeds.
Bird swarms, as they are otherwise used in moisture areas, are searched for forgiveness: As soon as the outer board is silent, the splendid peace of the former paradise is spread in the like a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari Finster: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first exploitors from Europe came into force, here organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa the first resistance, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Still today, the company is deprived of returning to Ogoniland: While from the entire Delta region of the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling springs and 7000 kilometers of pipelines are pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken, too unstable the Group is the situation.
All couples of hundreds of meters rage stalked artifacts like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christian trees" are called the heads of drill holes too tenderly.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded up to Mark.
Every time a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant current of raw oil runs into the water.
More than two billion litres, according to experts, have been fought into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil, as it drove to the sea before Alaska at the Havarie of the Supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
If you are responsible for the persistent eco-GAU, you will argue about it.
While the shell group makes sabotage and organized oil diesel responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protectors see burrowing drill heads and leak pipelines as the main causeer.
Shell lays down far lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner suggested the Group in 2008: the rate of defects on the lines alone is "a multiplicity higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks out of the distance like a abandoned, oil-proof workshop under the open sky, the mangroven shapes show up: they are splittered and oil-proofed up to the neck.
Among one of the many barrels that are partly connected with tubes, partly spread out arbitraryly on the ground, a fire flapps: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the raw oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the chief of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the catch pot, later drops out at the end of the line Kerosin and finally diesel.
So Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel à 300 liters daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
Deltabe residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The low diesel price with nearly 40 Euro cents per litre can still undercut the illegal cookers: for their raw materials they get for nothing.
It comes from "Bunkerers", which seize the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, according to experts throughout Nigerdelta, the country loses at least 16 million litres of raw oil daily.
However, only a disappearing small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is illegally disregarded: the share of lion fills organised criminal networks, among which politicians and high-ranked military should also be included, in petrol ships and intensify it on the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental catastrophe is more due to the movements of the population or the lax production method, considers the activist Akpobari purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and would not have thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's basis of life, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, the relationship of the Ogoni was particularly to Shell, but so destroyed that only a deduction of the Group would be in question: "Perhaps other nationalities, such as the Chinese, may be better identified."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"Highest time you disappear," says the muscular oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil distributors are caught by the special unit of the forces, they are not threatened to be arrested, but perhaps a painful lure.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers mainly from the nord want to benefit from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way," says Akpobari.
Ermitters discover dangerous construction error in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In the investigation of a not landed machine, investigators have discovered a possible construction error that could lead to a "astrous engine failure".
The Qantas airline now wants to complain to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the not-landed Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November apparently had much more happiness than before known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has detected a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines - and now warns against a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the event of an oil hose connection, it could produce fatigues and leaks, said in an opinion published on Thursday by the ATSB Authority.
This could have resulted in "a catastrophic engine failure".
The engines produced by Rolls-Royce were affected in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
This includes the Qantas Airbus, which had to land in Singapore on 4 November.
The Australian airline has now initiated legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It submitted a complaint at an Australian Bundesgericht in Sydney, which allows him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas Chief Alan Joyce said that his airline would demand damage for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine, parts were dissolved and the load surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire a cause for the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines must now be exchanged worldwide.
Australian investigators announced to carry out further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleets on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his 11 A380 temporarily on the ground.
At an A380, Lufthansa changed the engine as a precautionary measure.
The double-storey flyer is the world's largest passenger aircraft.
Landwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Overnight almost throughout the country snow has fallen.
On many streets there is chaos, trains and flights.
At least three people died in car accidents.
The winter frosts Germany: At iron temperatures, almost the whole Republic is snowed in the night - which leads many places to traffic chaos.
In the north and east there are partly 15 centimeters of thick snow covers.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was permanent, but the constant new snow was not finished.
In addition, fierce soils fought over the East Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime and Hydrography (BSH) awaits on the East Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning on storm floods with water levels of 1.2 meters above the normal level.
In Saxony, snow decays on the highways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the Meteomedia Meteomedia Observatory in Saxon Switzerland, alarm level violet was claimed - the highest level at all.
In part, there fell 30 centimeters of new snow, fresh and strong winds caused confusions.
There were several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2 snow and wind led to stocking traffic and storm.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutsche Bahn, significant disturbances occur in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and in northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, crashed trees on the rails or destroyed upper lines and weeks are the main problems.
In Saxony, distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld an ICE had to stop his journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firemen and rescue workers with wool covers, food and drinks in the train.
Snow winds fought over the streets.
On large German airports, the snowwinds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokesperson, some cancellations have already been reported.
According to a Fraport speaker, 40 flights have already been deleted in Frankfurt am Main.
Winter service is permanent.
Although only a few beached passengers are at the airport, there are still nearly 400 field beds available for them.
On many streets there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died at the collapse with a train on a track crossing in Ostholstein.
The locomotive was injured slightly.
Near Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered streets: even here, a truck was recorded on a rail crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
In the train, four passengers were injured – the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after her car had skipped on a smooth road at Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists have a good message: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore already bubbling up with light soils.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is sucked by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - usually up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its mark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus Buyer is looking for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The Deutsche Bank has just made its company's seat beautiful: the twin towers in the Frankfurt Bankenviertel have been modernized; the bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now, the financial group seems to want to recover the costs for renovation - and seek a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" calls for a speaker.
The speaker did not mention reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check if it's more meaningful to own or sell real estate itself and then to rent back," he said.
Thus, Germany's largest credit institution has already re-established its corporate headquarters in a short time.
The Bank had not taken over the double towers for EUR 272 million by the investors of a home-owned fund until mid-2007 and then renovated laboriously.
The energetic reconstruction abolished the data according to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to industry experts, the value of the towers now renamed in Greentowers is estimated to be around EUR 500 million.
Whether the buildings are sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, it is still open, said the speaker.
Thousands tear for dead mates
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the shaken miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies could still not be protected because the safety situation in the casualty shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, there was a violent explosion in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were disposed of under days.
One probe had been dropped into the casualty, but had not discovered any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could descending for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer any chance of survival for the mates.
The bodies couldn't be saved so far.
Now family and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island at radiant sunshine.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honour of the shaken mountains, 29 tables were set on which helmets, lamps and the names of the mates were to be seen.
Also pictures and personal objects, including clothes and surfboards, found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags wound to half a mile.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come "out of the depths of the earth" again to the surface, said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the celebration.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with his son's death as long as he had not seen his body, Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was shed in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the Memorial.
At the first explosion on November 19, mountain people of British and South African origin were also spilled.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases were penetrated, it would begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
To hell, warriors!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn relocates with his fighter epos "Walhalla Rising" old genre limits.
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned "Walhalla Rising"?
A prisoner Viking warrior with only one eye (Mad's Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tortures and, with almost superhuman forces, turns his opponents in order - sounds ideal for young male spectators looking for bloody action, especially because our hero likes to use rabiat killing methods and his enemies already rip the wooms out of the living body when he has bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says the whole film about no word, and even the other figures can be hit at most to one or two sentences or a few painful death screams.
Otherwise it is swayed and swallowed in the cruelly beautiful hill countryside of Scotland, which offers the Viking world of about a thousand years ago the scenes.
Ideal for adult Cineasts with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
It's nice, if a movie has several target groups, harm only if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn is regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher", but he refuses to make his works accessible to the Arthouse with a little more humor to the mainstream or a little less brutality.
Most of the artificial cinema friends are supposed to be shrinking from the irrigating brain mass and the wools.
The action fans die at the latest before boring, when Einauge, for freely interpretable reasons, breaks up with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and stirs an eternity in Flaute and Nebel before the team appears to arrive in America and swear there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found any cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially because of the magnificent pictures a pity, but also because behind the pretentious to bleeding facade is a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this movie, it's not about dialogues or a stringent act, it's all atmosphere, a film-made fever room.
And there is no escape for the spectator.
Refn gives him hardly a moment of relaxation and snares him with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack very slowly to the throat, but especially with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blunt boy who is faithfully sided with one eye preserves something like innocence, and all others are driven by anger.
Most of the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained but who becomes the warrior of hell for enemies and temporarily ally, perhaps the ambassador of the Devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for the devils anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The Nuclear Energy Authority IAEA has new references to a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country is refusing to take a position - it still allows controls.
At midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters attack a mysterious, spice-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the nearest larger city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor, which Syria claimed to have built in the quader with the help of North Korea, is hidden in a valley that departs from the electricity.
According to a lettering by the US Foreign Secret Service CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, which was commonly known as El-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce Plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technique from the fifty-century is hardly tempted.
The CIA presented a video presentation with unscharp satellite images.
By computer animation, she invaded the components of the reactor before the destruction, the reduced copy of the North Korean model from the nuclear center of Yongbyon.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor had been standing shortly before commissioning, it said, but was not yet covered with burning rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is hardly more known than then, yes, the puzzles became more larger in time.
The former US president George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, before the attack, the CIA was quite sure that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence ministers in Europe prefer to be more cautious and speak only of a "reactor" even if they think the CIA presentation is "plausibel".
They lack hard evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was to have a reactor before himself, a high UN diplomat answered in summer only lapidar that IAEA has "generous material to ask questions".
Although the Syrians hurried down the shelter of the alleged "unused military building", they planned the site thoroughly.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team found traces of uranium produced by humans under the former Chief Specteur Olli Heinonen in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the time immediately after the attack, which should be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown contractor - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always deemed to never operate a secret nuclear program or have built a reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
However, after analyzing the particles, the IEAEA rejected this as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus refuses to discuss it - as well as about satellite images.
In addition, it prevents the inspectors from a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the broken building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," recently the Prime Minister Ehud Olmert officially reaffirmed the position at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been unsuccessful since June 2008 and "develops into an increasingly serious problem of credibility for the Authority", as a high Western diplomat admits at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna - finally, a serious breach of the nuclear weapons locking contract is in space over which the IAEA guards.
The IAEA seems to see three other institutions, which are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor - and not yet exist.
To date, the inspectors have not disclosed which installations they are, which function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IAEA intern, and are derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and found a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely with this reason, Syria of the IAEA refuses access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA was sent by the USA to expose military facilities.
Because the Nuclear Tectives had become aware of the facilities by means of a tip from US secret services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that between the three places and the quader on the Euphrat material was transported and transported.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production".
However, there are "no indications of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come and where the plutonium for the bomb should be separated from it later, to these central questions, there are at least plausible suspicions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could store valuable traces were stored in three places.
As if the hundreds of truck charges were disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to have information about where the shark has remained.
The salt mine al-Tibni, located on the other side of the Euphrat, located just a few kilometers from El-Kibar, which has examined Syria in 1998 for its suitability as a stock of radioactive waste, is considered unlikely to be the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently brought her into contact with the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the orbit show that Syria did earthwork at the three suspected places and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This can be a coincidence, but has hardly contributed to eliminating suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - only shows the effort of the inspectors' interest.
However, Damascus also blew this proposal.
If western diplomats in Vienna still had been insufficient for a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter had no high urgency, for example, US ambassadors Glyn Davies has been bringing special inspections into the game for a few months, one of the tightest means that the Vienna Atomic Authority has to carry out controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who should propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but he still he hesitates.
It is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, there is a need for a majority in the IAEA Governor's Council, and some of the 35 countries represented there are nothing but an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat gives: "What if they don't find anything at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still unnamed directorial debut in summer, there is annoyance.
The script wrote herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
During the Yugoslavia war, the woman, a Muslim, is in love with her Serbian rape.
Bosnian women's associations have immediately protested, so some of Sarajevo's plans were transferred to Hungary in the short term.
In the meantime, the film has been rotated in Hungary and in post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN Refugee Service UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie himself is an ambassador of the UN Refugee Fund.
She is not diplomatic - she offered women a meeting in Hungary before weeks, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps have not existed, and Jolies' attitude toward the victims tells her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Fund, her organization recommended that Jolie be released as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, has, after some hin and her, granted a turning permit for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author himself regrets, she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked with a lot of effort in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give all the sides involved a voice.
However, it remains vague in its contents.
This is how a second synopsis of the film in the network, which sounds quite different: the loved ones knew in it before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds quite different from the variant " rape sacrifices are angry in torture servant".
That Jolies' film actually starts before the war - so much is safe.
The pressure on her, says Jolie, is "unfair and is based on misinformation".
Now you can only make the hackers of Hollywood peace: by putting the script, as many as before, illegally into the network.
Nothing like gone here.
This evening it's finally going right around for the Irish.
No trace of sorrow.
For this, the home team dominates too much of its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
The fans jolly with joy with cracking loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pool in the Southern Cork bursts because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance in beer cups - and meet.
"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there 500 Euro victory plus tickets to Las Vegas for the world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this brilliant drinking game and the retaining computer scientists, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to enjoy deviating from the boring question of what the future will bring.
On his plan is not fun in Las Vegas, he will be conducting application talks in January in New Zealand.
"I have a furious feeling in it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I still have no work there."
After all, his friend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "She had backed her wish job as an event manager, perhaps a good sign," says the young man and laughs.
Because of bad perspectives at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish are likely to leave the country in the next time, experts from the ESRI Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin are predicting.
By 2015, they even count on 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of immigration similar to those under which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upheaval, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, Tristesse now becomes wide again.
The economic crisis is particularly uncertain about the young, well-educated Irish, for which it was so far only upstairs.
Job loss and social deterioration seemed absurd in the tree years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are more readers from young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the brook in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country loses a whole generation."
"The last one, please turns out the light."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Union, sees a gloomy future, because the government only practices eyewise and does not offer the young people any future prospects.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they do not have a strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-olds.
She observes how her co-ordinates hang from an unpaid internship to the next.
Their greatest concern, she says, is it to have to emigrate itself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the topic positively.
McLarnon organises the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a round-up service on work abroad.
"For professional beginners, work abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career manager," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galeering service, but also brings freedom and fun.
As it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for half a year.
Because there was nothing to do with the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are just moving up a fashion house.
In January we continue to go to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home has seen O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra layers to pay the loan for his home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, when he hits the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I deserve money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never anymore."
He laughs a little shy and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with well-kept gardens, in the entrances park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros for four years ago - 100 percent credit financed.
"There were crazy times, there were simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have kids I have to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start new."
The construction engineer doesn't like the mourning complaint he's currently hearing.
"Nobody has to starve - our situation is far from as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"A while working abroad, that's not the worst thing can happen - perhaps we feel like Iren only."
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simple."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let the future open and just see how it's going on with life elsewhere.
A few years of work in London, he's already behind himself, and why shouldn't he and his girlfriend work well in New Zealand?
One thing, however, is still a matter that concerns him in these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He's afraid it could get into a livelihood party.
"Not too many emotions," he says and drinks a big swallow from his beer.
"Well, that sounds frightening."
"Let's rather call it a way-go party, quite loose, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America becomes stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than the United States.
The Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly evident in this year's survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased strongly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong collapse last year, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populated countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which reduce the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of the respondents explained that they are satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. These are as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (diagram 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of its government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to increase democracy.
This may be because of the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were captured by a stronger social network.
(Reports by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America from this week in 2009 only slightly increased the poverty rate in Latin America and again dropped by 32% this year.)
But there are strong mood differences from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of the divorced President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva reflect in a widespread progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the beginning of the survey, many interviewed people in Latin America have seen a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Graph 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been victims of crime last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the values have decreased and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of private and market economies: about 71% of respondents reported overregionally that the private economy is essential for development, in 2007 it was 56% (see graph 6).
Approximately 58% explained that only the market economy can make progress to its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have retained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has ruled many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most of the countries of Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
A selective sleeper
No one had expected the elections to be perfect on November 28 in Haiti.
But the facts exceeded the fears of the electoral workers who hurried the arched country to help.
Overcrowded election hours, multiple votes, elections in the Rinnstein, destroyed election halls and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Election halls opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless in January, struck around looking for a possibility of choice.
Some finally gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected top riders, demanded the withdrawal of the electoral results due to a alleged fraud.
There was partially violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, head of the UN mission in Haiti, referred to the election as "as quite good in many interests".
According to a careful statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, as serious as they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is supposed to be obliged to the unpopular separate President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected vote is available for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former first-Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invaluability claim.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no consent in the voters, explains from the voter to the winner of the vote, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims still live in tents, a small participation was feared.
On the election day many Haitians were prevented by lack of organization in voting.
Shortly before the beginning of the election, approx. 250,000 clauses needed for election were not yet distributed.
It's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government an important step in reconstruction of Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, learned a wave of sympathy, which pushed her popularity rate up by 20 points to more than 50%. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, whether this helps you to re-elect in the next year depends on whether the apparently saddening Cristina Fernández is more compromising than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who, even after the choice of his wife, managed economic policy, often set up budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidency to spend the extra revenues according to their own opinion.
On the paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the convention last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further decays.
Some regime critics from the series of ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (when one parliamentary officer hit another faced and others accused the government of the bribe) the Congress failed to adopt the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," says the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, which gives the President an even more opportunity to spend money according to its own opinion.
The economy is running hot: it will probably grow by up to 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage requirements of the trade unions - are at almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, explained growth and poverty fighting for its main objectives, not the inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, shaken the private sector and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Census INDEC, which then enjoyed official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate way now?
She called on the private economy and the trade union leaders to talk.
According to official statements, wage increases should be limited to 18% in the next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth rate by a large devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may, for this reason, want to reconcile Argentina economically with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with securities owners who rejected the country's former re-debtedness in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be insisting on an agreement with the borrowers from the Paris Club, which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The churches had always rejected an inspection by the IMF, as otherwise usual.
But last month, Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" when creating a new national consumer price index. It looks like this would be the first step towards purifying INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after the term of office.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which mostly has enough of churcherism.
When the Argentines return from their summer holiday in March, the wave of sympathy that has been brought to it will be dissolved.
If she wants to win another choice, she will have to decide whether she still and quietly lifts many political decisions of her husband.
Poor applause for China
Taiwan's chooser slowly approaches a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of his great brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all voters, were open to choose in the five districts of mayors and city councils, which is considered to be a wide-ranging assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of railway-breaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese native for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only scarcely.
Although his KuTitang Party (KMT) sets out three of the five mayors, she received no majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which supports greater independence in Taiwan, received almost 50% of the votes that KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, the share of his party has fallen by approx. 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual events in Taiwan such as truck convois with criminal makers, flag-swinging mass envelopes and only tightly clothed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious attempt to kill.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary president of the KMT held a speech on the eve of the election on a KMT candidate,
When a man shot him from the crowd into the face. Line was wounded and killed an enthusiastic spectator.
The bizarre referencer is not clear whether the protector would kill Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Depending on this, the attack according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, has affected the choice and brought the DPP into a bad light, which has brought the KMT more voices.
Perhaps China was the largest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland have not been discussed.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for social housing and the creation of jobs.
The Taiwanese love their factual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relations with the Government in Beijing.
This time, however, the DPP also avoided exciting the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
On the other hand, Ma wants to be confirmed that the majority of the Taiwanese people support China's policy.
The Government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy to bring Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a retailer to Taipei to prepare a summit for investment security and medical cooperation.
Surely it also wants political integration, but the most important first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has been newly invented.
Two years ago she was strongly weak: the former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison because of corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he committed absolute independence.
But under Tai's regentship, a new generation of forged politicians developed and the DPP fights for the votes of the professionals and the youth.
Tsai found great consent as the Presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea-smith as a contact point between the DPP and China, but this presupposes prejudice-free discussions.
Tsai publicly explained that her party offers a "confidential alternative" to mascipal approach to China.
Chen seems very angry about this change.
From his cell he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have done better to exist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged Pragmatic Su to refrain from the Presidential Candidate.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is hard to choose its possible candidates.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to lead their election struggle without it.
The main reasons for his impopularity seem to be unemployment and the increasingly horror between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan supports re-accession only limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic cooperation with China inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no back again."
Grammy nominations: The jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you take place on the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the ceremony at the Nobel Prize Award Award 2009. Now the 26-year-old Jazz-Bassistin and singer has been overwhelmingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has been a celebrated star since her album "Esperanza" in the jazz scene in 2008, nomination appears a little unusual. However, it corresponds to the Grammy Rules, after which an artist may have published at least three albums before publishing the album with which he was known in the public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her vibrant voice and a good sense for pop, radio and Latin music, you can easily compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success is next in 2003 as a jazz artist in this category of nomination spaldings.
In addition, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated in the category instrumental albums. This favorite of critics experienced a giant success.
Among the competitors Iyers include "Moody 4B" of experienced Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of Keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbed favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where else albums can be found by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret societ of the wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue was well deserved in the category of great groups. He thus acts against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octette, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead to the classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53th Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five votes, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra, with three votes.
Among the nominated links to Southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonicians and performed in 2009 in the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, located in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandolinen Concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concert Building Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" from Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" from Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" were nominated by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" from the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Orchestra and Choir of Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivans "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, parrot for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's symphony No. 4 was launched and recorded in the Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonicists under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen on 4 January.
The 30-minute piece is named "Los Angeles" and devoted to the former oil magnate Mikhail Chodorkowski, who sits in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concert" received a nomination in the category Instrumentalolo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolinen artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category orchestra presentation for a recording of the works of Strawinski with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violin Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated as instrumental alsoists.
This year only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sofie by Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, Sopranistin Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moschee in Temecula gains approval from the Planning Committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often hot public hearing.
Criters urged the project to promote both terrorism and traffic break.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre corresponds to the local provisions and will become an aesthetic sightseeing.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, it makes me proud."
"It shows justice."
"There are only few opponents," he added.
"You're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides, according to the Press-Enterprise, were quite uniformly distributed.
The debate was continued on the newspaper’s website.
"There is no more America," said a comment.
"It's another planet of the monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"Americans are at the end."
Planned Islamic centres have also led protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In the Temecula Valley Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for violencelessness.
His community with about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wished a larger and better places than the camp they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 mediterranean mosque is supposed to have two minarettes and about 13m high.
It is to be created on the 17500 m2 land at Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbe could allow new forms of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign bacteria species that can live from arsene, e.g., opens new opportunities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements considered to be vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to wax either phosphorus or arse."
"This makes it very special, although it is almost a kind of 'fremd' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
Six main elements have so far been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, as the scientists found out, the bacterium in the California Mono Lake continues to grow even if it replaces phosphorus by arsene.
"Therefore one wonders what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, so bear.
The study covers microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculations on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can start biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily permanently prescribed", said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novum because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not random.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiological Institute, which led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to the high arsenic content.
Since arsen and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes who are both exposed may replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of the arsenic is primarily based on the chemically similar behaviour of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for the organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsen works differently from phosphorus. It comes into our biochemical system where it is almost all spilled," explains Anbar.
The researchers expelled the GFAJ-1 bacterium of increasing arsenic concentration. It adjusted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it also can survive in arsene shows that an arsen-based life form can naturally occur, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsene is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsene is not new. But there has not been a functioning example yet.
Arsens appeared more frequently in the early years of the earth, she says, so science has assumed that early forms of life used it.
"This gives reason to the assumption that life could have developed differently than in the early earth's age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research work was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dog found in Compton
The other two of the four exhibition dogs stolen before a Bellflower motel were found from Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriffs.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when Unknown stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express-Van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, the government statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, Steve Whitmore, a spokesman of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well up," says Whitmore.
"You're in good condition."
"They were returned to their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not provide precise information on the location of dogs, nor on the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still running."
"We don't want to say this anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We follow some traces."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They took their two dogs in a district animal home in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Representatives of the sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old Rüde, and Didi, a 10-month-old Hündin - were uninjured according to the government statement.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to present Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, stayed missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace had to participate in the competition.
As Peek of the Times informed on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the nearly one-month tour of the couple of dog show to dog view.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stay in Motels and park their delivery car in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - one boxer, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with them into their motel room.
The thickly Akitas and Corgis stayed in the truck because it was cooler there.
They left the window a spare wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Pek promised everyone who could give a reference to the Corgis a finder wage. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet decided whether a finder's wage is paid.
The lion bruises again after judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New Yorker bankruptcy judge often blessed the "prepare" glorious plan to cut off the debts of $5 billion and to ease the 86-year-old entertainment company the way for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of the US bankruptcy law, so that the new start of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglas Entertainment, is no longer under way. Barber and Birnbaum will preside as a leading business leader to the slightly speculated studio.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to approx. 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 actually enters into force only if JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned bond of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings $75 million, leads the company. The funding is to be financed by mid-December.
In May 2009, the restructuring of the studio began to help the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company leader who struggled with interest payments of $300 million per year, to solve their financial problems.
In August the managing director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring expert who became known by his activity with Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve the financial concerns of MGMs and pay out the more than 140 luminaires of the studio lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company for purchase at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion claimed by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started from the front when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which after months of debate and internal disputes was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived the bankruptcy in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid for the management of the company $375,000 monthly, receives a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan of seven or eight films to enter the movies in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which should be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who funded about 18% of the MGM loan, tried a merger of the studio with Lion Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both players can rip a significant hole into your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game corresponds to about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 doses of play-doh.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently, I was looking for three electronic toys under $80 three national toy dealers - a whale market, a toys "R" us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had entered into force. This year the technology toys are more powerful and cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, a broader offer is found on the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cell-powered toys on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattle, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are plucking figures, as large as sea pigs that sing a note when you press on your belly.
Press once corresponds to a note, by multiple presses you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you start pressing once, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers exchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to its novel jackets with bicycle blocking, it masters the Moon Wall.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you must remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole lot of question cards that can make a car ride to a class hour, with a best checker with auto correction function as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series with a new, brighter screen.
None of these versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for the games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not larger than a string wooden box and have a own LED screen.
The game aims to put the blocks together to words before the time expires. It is great for an improvised accounting competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2 Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the Code Online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
This can be rolling shoes or a puffle stove.
The latest head cells-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is not larger than the head of your tooth brush.
The beetle moves quickly to 12 vibrant silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a bitch of fun.
And he stops a lot.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China become more gentle
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over a city square, checked his nervous subjects and gave commands with military authority and defeated voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary racisms and their hook on violence - impress the spectators.
"Look up!"
"Look straight!"
"Tell them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are like that!"
Four girls, hardly evolved from the teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and pants were stupid.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight row.
Four proper hats sat perfectly on the blue-white striped hair.
"They look on average for me," Mr. Tang notes lowly.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to pollute the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new candidates must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey greens.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence by lower stars: According to 50 officials in 2009, he was a non-proprietary infant car and stared at the operator until he packed in half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image fundamentally.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the urban police stripes. They have been specially selected because of their appearance, good figure and youth.
They're supposed to give the rough police a softer, feminine aspect.
But, unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are allowed to enforce urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media are routinely showing another picture.
In January 2008, officials in the Hubei Province shouted a spectator to death when he filmed them with his mobile phone as they slipped a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be crushed without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai water melon dealer suffered after a hand mass with five officials brain injuries.
A video game of violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officials trained in China when attacking road dealers.
"Chengguan is frightening the government," said the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper demanded "really thorough cleaning".
Skeptics are the current approach for significantly insufficient.
When the district sought eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women should have real tasks or only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to job ad, women from 18 to 22 years of age were searched with good figure and "harmonic facets".
They should be above average - more than 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the 26th year of life.
According to officials, the activity for women over 25 is too physically exercising.
"The most important is her image," said a unnamed district official at the quasi government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job, first depends on their outer appearance, such as size, weight, facets, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities".
"Women Chengguan are like flower vases," he said and added, "but they also have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district's city administration, does not want to agree to this description,
However, it was admitted that in China size limits are not unusable for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform facets.
Whether this is equal to good appearance is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disarmaments do not need to apply.
"We cannot use lame or buckligs here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, patroled on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bags and a well shaped mouth.
It does not feel as sexistic that so great value is placed on its appearance.
"Find out I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic view.
Your colleague with the bubbles, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, since they have ambitious career plans than simply shaking distributors through the gases to prevent them from making businesses.
Every morning, the strip covers about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many bread and tofu dish as possible on foot or on their bike before they are hunted.
"Herr Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you so often!" said Mrs. Xu to a distributor who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his nudel kitchen on a bicycle car.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotone than effortful.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20 who studyes sales in recreation.
"All routine."
One reason is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of dealers, such as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report them to their male supervisors.
This is intended to protect them from public oppositions that are often exposed to officials in China.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, had killed Chengguan officials after the rumor.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the night incident, 14 government vehicles were thrown down or burned.
Xindu has been spared by such violence so far.
But disruption cannot be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square, on which the female officials patroled this morning, gathered more than 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired instead of in a workshop, contrary to the rules on the citizen's steering.
The owner called Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of retirement, the officials walked the way to their vehicles with a wrath of face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male strip, remained behind. He turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're going on in a verbal way."
"Sometimes, but also physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
"The most time the people begin with the fight."
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Senator John Ensign, attorneys of the Ministry of Justice, freed the charges raised against him with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to give her husband a lobby activity after his affair, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal objection against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. Until the scandal, which provided for headlines throughout the country and put his career a damp, he was considered a potential presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
According to Senator Ensign's office, he was "highly pleased" on the judgment after the one-year investigation.
However, the Ethics Committee of the Senate could still impose a disciplinary sentence.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been suspended and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. They believe that there were sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, which were first opened in October 2009 at the New York Times, led to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral helpers, helped to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as treasurer during a election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends in order to provide Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogation he took over for them after the attitude of Hampton's lobby work.
Since Hampton was still in Ensign's election team recently, he was not allowed to take lobby work for his former employer or the whole senate for a year.
According to Ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, which were close friends before the affair, disagreed with the so-called prohibition of the turning door lovacration.
According to the published indices, "it seems to be an agreement and the infringement of the rotating door stats," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specialized in the defense of clients who are in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethikants said that the Ministry seemed very cautious in incorporating political charges after a variety of defeats persecuted by the media with great interest, including the decision last year, to drop the charge against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct of the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrible," said Melanie Sloan, the chairman of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who has brought several charges against Mr Ensign before the court.
"This basically means that high-level government officials can now assume that the laws are not applicable to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that on Monday he received a telephone call from a prosecutor and another on the next day when he was informed that the Ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensign's defender had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated again in a statement on Wednesday, the Senator had acted "in accordance with the law".
Mr. Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he made to the prosecutors.
"I'm not well going into the discussion details between the Ministry of Justice and me. Just so much is said: "We think we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to terminate the investigations for a separate appeal by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 by Mr Ensign's parents had violated the Hamptons against the Bundeswahlgesetz.
The Election Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money had been something different from a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found thanks to Mr. Ensign lobbyist work.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that after Mr. Hampton had passed on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's staff chief, John Lopez, had a talk with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was "camping at the Ministry of Interior" for a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also arranged for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Minister of Transport to agree on a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
Last year, when information about these affairs came to the public for the first time, Mr. Ensign apologized with his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had stood in the fourth place in the Republican ranking.
After many months of failure to notice, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he had a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police research, his press speaker Jennifer Cooper, the Senator hopes that the ethics commission will follow very quickly the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up his investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calling makes attention to Twitter
A half dozen of them were tipping away into the cranes in the courtroom.
In the minute clock, they sent their reports on brutal witness statements on Twitter.
At the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter notifications about the process of rape and bed chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end when the judiciary pronouncement of the jury's death sentence falls.
However, Mr. Hayes lawyers have already filed requests to the court, which will provide reasons for a appeal and which will cover the courts in years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - even by the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has come to a "circus atmosphere" and a so widespread, immediate penetration of touching details, so that the jury had been inadmissiblely influenced by public disarmament.
This opposition could cause the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"As I experienced it during this process, I believe it is really a danger when the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes chief defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, briefly and straightforwardly rejected the requests by decision last week when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court claims have found that the reporting of famous cases causes doubts about the fairness of a process.
In his historical decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States abolished the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopathene from Cleveland, who was supposed to have killed his wife, and said in his decision that because of the New Media there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the court hall".
Some believe that the television series and the play film "On the Flight" are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court claims that Mr. Hayes' verdict will consider half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication paths from the courtroom, which were still unimaginable at the case of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes persecuted by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, Professor at Stanford Law School, who has examined the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, she is arbitraryly defeated.
Professor Donohue said that some appetition courts could be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the processes fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many who present the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss years and thus delay a condemnation.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes could have been pre-convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them cruel actor photographs during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photos of the victim, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years, and her educators, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, they would have filled abusively.
The defenders say that they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, and argue that the judge had falsely exchanged a juror who was a critic of the prosecutor and that he had impermissible pressure on the judgment when he had made the unavoidable decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a judgment that they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the Governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously refused the flames of emotions about the case.
"There is such a daily Andrang of the media peppers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "you haven't seen before in New Havens and perhaps even in the country.
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the allegation that these direct messages were more aggressive than reports that are slower repaid, was a technical enemy view that embarrassed the reporting of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeal courts were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes needed the adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers strengthen this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard was repealed on the basis of the reporting and made it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the separation?
After a campaign of vibrant words and negativeness this week, little courtesy broke out in Washington.
Is it the forum of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the summit of the Congress brought no breakthrough in the major questions that were to be addressed during the so-called "lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a period of government in which no more decisions were taken.
After all the things you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two sides or a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a Partial Point Collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficiency Commission on Wednesday was also civilised, despite the political differences which continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction will result in mutual respect over a period of months, which divides the ideological gap that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that there was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise will be called upon, while one is trying to consider the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after another party warfare.
Consequently, the meeting itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Finally, the November election Washington has voted mildly for at least a short time.
"No question, the soundfall has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center".
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections arouse partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "Lame Oneck Session", Republicans and Democrats have little choice to find a solution."
Bush's tax reductions end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even everyone, whether temporary or lasting.
Similarly, there is a compromise on the increased unemployed, although only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favoured tax reductions for the rich, while refusing to support unemployed workers.
After the meeting in the White House on Tuesday, optimism has increased that these questions can be agreed during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brooking Insitution warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session does not necessarily have to lead to a lasting cooperation of the parties when the new 112. Congress will be held in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-compliance is more likely, perhaps even indispensable.
"After doing the things that have to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this scepticism is divided by many - that leads courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens from today until 2012, as a prefighting, or shadow boxes, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party cyclists whose education was useful.
How worried the Republican leaders may be that they are too pokery, they know that they must try to keep their promises to reduce government spending and to put out the health reform.
These party lines are already clear in the first reactions regarding the recommendations of the Commission on the deficit, which include tax reform and the increase of some taxes, as well as the increase in pension age and the reduction of government expenditure.
Deputy Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own opinion, have urged so much to put the deficit question on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan an official recommendation and they are very struggling to reach this number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the Board, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the struggle between the White House and the Republican people at the Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party conflicts when the Republicans challenge Obama with regard to the state budget, taxes and the health system, then followed by a phase of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that despite the partyality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a sackgasse as happened in 1995, both parties must take care of the public response.
Anyone who is sentenced to lose will have to change the course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be a optimistic viewpoint.
Participality and polarization are today greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congress republics than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure precedent for a much wider choice in 2012.
As a result, many Americans welcome the courtesy that is being presented this week.
But on both sides it will require much more effort to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
Dispatched US document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "cleptocracy" and it gives a part of the bribe and protection money they collect to the Kremlin. Thus, in February the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both police and the State Security Service are extorting high protection fees so that they can maintain their expensive living standards in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal bands.
Every shift of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "Vertikale of Authority" - takes its part of the money that the ladder migrates upwards.
The memo sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that in the meantime had been cleared up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known building company, have repeatedly rejected corruption claims over years and he has won numerous blasphemy complaints against such accusations.
In September, he explained to a Russian television station when he was asked for a documentation that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. This has led to surveys.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the report of the Ambassador, individuals are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the Moscow Government and the crime has led to some calling them "disrupted" and concludes that the government acts more like a clinic Council than a government," says the Memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of the criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "dach" or protection), which extends through the police, state security (FSB), service authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands at the top."
"FSB, MVD and the Miliz are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors are following at the lower level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups in some areas close a gap because the city does not offer any help."
The report continues that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and arrests the police small businessmen.
A source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get the protection of MVD and FSB (and not of organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, the protection by criminal gangs is no longer as demanded as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest, none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - because of some pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men who go into the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the office crates," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is no part of the political class because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of forces, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Throughout the country, it is estimated that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks at place 154 of a newer study on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed from "the least corrupt" to "the most corrupt").
The revealing of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in Moscow's time, will certainly cause misconception within the Russian government, although, as Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow's errors, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a counterfeit and reacted angry to the revealing that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't have expected this to happen with such an arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to confront with the past
In a weakly illuminated, concreted classroom with dirty and bleaching walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everybody here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Serng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the slaughterer", the commander in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in the northwest of Cambodia remains popular, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitulation of the Khmer Rouge towards the government, long-standing followers are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells children of former soldiers the history of the Khmer Rouge for the first time.
And in July a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it sentenced the former chief of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years of prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Rouge Veterans Alnlong Vengs grew, made their efforts to reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodia society difficult.
"There is still refusal and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For her life was glorious under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It splits home families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died of disease, revision or hunger.
When the Vietnamese arrived and the Pol Pot-Ied government crashed in 1979, the remains of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement broke, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their base in the west of the mountains and jungle of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a peace agreement funded by the UN led in 1993 to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to cross the government, which led to the capitulations of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 of a natural death, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested by governmental forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in the prison of Phnom Penh in 2006, where he waited for his trial.
When their goers no longer protected them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the devastating poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Although a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they laid their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, uneducated farmers.
"These people have benefited very little from captulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng
"They are anchored into the utopic agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old who had joined in 1974 as a teenager of the Rhmer Rouge, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before he settled in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice builder.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we need to take care of ourselves."
The Khmer Rouge Tribunal, which is ongoing, has also awakened concerns here.
At the beginning of next year, the court will try to raise Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife and Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the abominations, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has helped little to soften the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have been concentrated on The Chaem, 64 years old, which had been in the late 1970s during the Khmer Rouge regime district chef in Manteay Meanchey Province.
In 2007 she had told representatives of the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had managed the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project where thousands of forced workers probably died.
On a hot evening, the Chaem returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun had long shadows on the fermented grass, the Chaem refused to discuss their past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court invited them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned against the fact that the situation would become uncertain, the court would charge more suspicious, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so as everything can understand."
The center created the first school book approved by the government on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-sided "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connections of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family refuses many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are horrible because they are not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the school book and the court gain after and after influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Top in the Dangrek mountains leads a path overwhelmed by shrubs and with plastic dirt to a rectangle of black rose, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here on a tyre hip after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile seller on the roadside, said she don't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place, where she will put a bush of mature bananas - hoping he will bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to collect non-waveable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that one will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting by the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
For years, the US government had tried to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But official of the US Government told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements with Belarus have been reached to remove 187 pounds of weapons-resistant uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
This prepared the stage for the agreement on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the topic, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April that had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit of 2012.
"I was really enthusiastic about the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear safety summit (from 2012).
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure everything precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US Government has helped six countries to get rid of its highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko explained that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How highly enriched uranium - hundreds of Kilos, which is fundamentally weapony, and less enriched uranium," said Lukashenko then.
"That's our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it indicated interest in the meeting of an agreement.
The first call to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly radiated, say officially.
It was loaded into a special train, which is more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, say officially.
The second start was decided on Monday and was carried out by airplane according to the officials.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with a large part of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and coordinated to build confidence," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who works on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-increasing Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-fighted uranium this year and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012, according to the Joint Agreement.
The relations between Belarus and the USA have been tended for years, mainly because of Lukashenkos, disregarding human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues welcomes the United States of America and Belarus to announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections of the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaida prisoners over Spanish state territory to Guantánamo, as shown by a telegram of the US Ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected by Wikileak's documents and reflected on the daily newspaper "El País" (cables). It is added that the former deputy head of government, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign planes that are flying Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which aid was charged for human rights defeating practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the report of the Council "had hit Zapatero in the farewell" and confirmed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over the Spanish state territory."
"You just want to be informed," not to be "unprepared," reports Aguirre per cable.
The former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed to the Ambassador that the Spanish government would not want to pay great attention to this matter, although the government has little opportunities to influence because they lay in the hands of the judges.
In January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González gave the message that he would not block the judicial initiative, declassification of documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on the CIA flight.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," said the Ambassador after a discussion with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "official coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly between governments," said Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, where the Ambassador of the USA and the Spanish Minister of Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "the Spanish judges were madly concerned with their independence and did what they thought appropriate," he gave his employees instructions to "prevent upheld rhetoric comments to leave the tensions.
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach in this matter.
"Unlike their general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt that the Government of Zapatero's actions, which could be interpreted as possible infringements of human rights, has tolerated or deliberately ignored, will strike capital, even if these enthusiasms could negatively affect the government of the USA," he stressed.
The child murderer admits that she complained on the Internet about the "mood" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when this was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, which she leads from the young, she keeps contact with a cousin and at least one girlfriend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
In order to understand these, you need to know their love life, which reconstructs the ABC daily on the basis of witness statements from their family members.
In 1998, the 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial.
She held a year.
Shortly after she had resolved her relationship, she became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his former never let him perform a DNA analysis.
She soon entered a different relationship.
The elected one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to take care of the labour market, the little woman stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of their news, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke and separated them.
In March 2008, she is on Menorca alone and writes: "Alberto is very strange and rough because I came to work."
"When I told him, he liked it well, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day and not to be free, to do and let what he wants."
Later she mentions a message that she just received on the phone, "I want you to come back this month or get me a address I can send the boy to you."
She complains, "If he doesn't like I'm leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May she speaks of the return to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only stay there until the nineteenth, because I have to imagine a job on the 20th, if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she takes her firstborn when everything goes well.
"He will be with the one with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him again with someone except with my mother", a doubtful intention when one considers their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month was supposedly murdered on the 10th.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand, he's with me and the place likes him a little, but on the other hand, he must go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"Where he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the girl."
On 17th, memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss of César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos to e-mail. If you see if he wants, he finds me such a shit."
On 30th, one more thing: "The boy's fine. He goes into a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots me money."
On the Internet, in Anime and Mangablogs, there are communications from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the jailer".
"Terror a la galega (heading)."
The last man who lived with her, an eased hunting overseer, explains to have conscience bites because he feels guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Judgment Prisoners in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
The mandatory defender, Carlos Maceda, said that she could not remember the expiry of the fact, "and she did not intend to harm the little one."
However, before she had said that she had drowned César in the bathtub and put his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutorship requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in the Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP already looks at the parliamentary elections - preferably or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party has reached in these elections is usually twice as high as those in the elections in Catalonia.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 61.473 votes at the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the regional elections in 2006.
On the last Sunday, the PPC reached 384,091 votes.
If this rising tendency - result of the redirection of the PSC’s vote and the binding of the voters of the PP - should stop, the PP's analysts predict that the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congress delegates, while CiU also gains four (which now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 members (from 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental significance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a Member - at present it has three - while ICV could hold or win a Member.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date will be with the municipal elections in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to bring an end to the socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the socialists will not achieve a majority, nor have their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican Debakel, it is not deliberate that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, where it must achieve 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in their voting share in the four provincial capitals and could become a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced to be able to play the main role in Tarragona's change, where they had ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
And Lérida lies the PP only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, has a good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election struggle they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels, or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant growth.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and strives to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell produced thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistaners and the Nigerians arrested by the police of the police of Barcelona formed the Jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "motion to liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was author of the Attentates in Bombay, who demanded 106 deaths in 2008 - with passports.
The Spanish Interior Minister has a great significance to these investigations, which goes so far that he assures that with the "Operation Kampai" the counterfeit device Al Qaidas was "swakened" worldwide and "should be able to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and subsequently sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "fighters" could punishlessly cross the borders of European and other Western countries.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that was active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units have also contributed to the research in Thailand, and it is not excluded that in the area of the EU there will be similar offences in the next few days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanians Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand where the Pakistanian Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested as well as the Thais Sirikanlaya Kijbum.
They had led from Bangkok to the cell established in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole passenger passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued on the names of men from 25 to 45 years old and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have a visa stamp.
In investigation circles, it is stressed that, although the author of this offence, Laschkar e-Taiba, was one of the recipient groups of the passenger passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand, it has not been proven to be a link between those arrested in Catalonia and the offence in Bombay.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that several thousand dollars had been sent from a money transfer company some days before the attack of Catalonia, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command", which ended the life of 106 people.
The police confiscated a comprehensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Caacho, held the opportunity yesterday to present Artur Mas personally its terms of supporting his term of office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which is not different from those already held during the election campaign and can be summarized with the priority of economic recovery and the failure of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement proposed by the regional leader at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party was sure to turn to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 Members who won her last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel indispensable. For the candidate of the bourgeois-regional party CiU is dependent on the fact that at least one of the opposition parties contains the vote at its office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter in the coming parliamentary elections are dependent on a possible enthusiasm with the PP. However, the discussions that Mas is currently taking place with the other leaders of the Party are about Catalonia.
As regards the PPC Party Chairman, it calls for "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomous Region, similar to the Basque country, and which even wants to submit a referendum to the Vice-President of CiU.
Both political leaders are common to make the built-in political devices of the regional administration slender and to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Mas's office are covered by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolor's Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Altenpflegeheim confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of Olot's Oldenheim do not exclude that her nurse killed over eleven older people
The responsible of the old nursing house La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference, in which they showed the damage of the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was responsible - to the establishment.
The head of the old nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced, "La Caritat wants to charge the responsible (for the deaths), but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution must not only take a loss of social reputation because it did not detect the career's criminal acts in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the victims of the family.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime went back on August 2009 and that he continued to kill since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the old nursing home - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their ages and diseases were carried out by telephone.
The director of La Caritat nominated this point around and said that "existent measures could never have been the reason for the incidents."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the dispute, there were no indices for infringements of a person other than the accused person."
The "Deadsengel" was already baptized before 11 murders and explained that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and that one and a half months later the second old lady was murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime in which he had given a mixture of different disturbances.
The director of La Caritat said that the access of the staff to the medicines was difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the tranquillizer cocktail used the nurse in six of nine crimes in order to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will show whether Vila lying and actually chose a less grievous death for his first victims or whether he burned them out from the inside by giving them Bleichlauge, as he had done it according to confession in three women who he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, there is no faith in the nurses' statements, not even in the number of dead murders that could be quite more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it would not make sense to change his procedure suddenly after eight successful murders.
They say that they made them available for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents to the justice.
Threats of the European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors responded sharply to the threat of the ECB president Trichet yesterday, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity."
The risk levels of the european countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself and that the euro has hardly put to points which causes concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of a illiquide market, which, to the extent in which it collapses again, is due to the closure of short and highly speculating positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
Today a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, which would require the ECB to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank called on the termination of the plan for the purchase of state debt as they were ineffective and the removal of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only one week of unlimited access should be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least to March" and to maintain the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity by at least June.
We also expect that the program for the purchase of bonds will continue and give a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets will be thrown back from yesterday and if nervously persisting to withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As was the case at the ECB session in May, where the Bank reaffirmed that the purchase of state debt papers should not be considered and the markets would then collapse, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot with which she provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The government's capital management issued only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of markets according to the words of trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possible more 15 000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks are ruled.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after it has not recognized the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government will have to receive parliamentary consent to its new budget on Tuesday, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel made its discourse on the summit of the Heads of State and the Government on 14 December. There, political unity is required to show that we play the same party together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish Government President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Rental reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis four seasons of years.
The Zapatero and Trichet double effect explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish Central Bank was rapid and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the trichet effect. Therefore, we put on a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our re-debtability.
For Spain, the application of an aid plan would be a self-sacrification.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need, and the Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March, and interest rates are extremely expensive and access to markets would be closed in the long term.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the motto of Caesar's wife: "Now not only does being count, but also the shine."
Just courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen fights the Society Assembly of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fade away.
David Álvarez, founder of the company's gulf, will fight El Enebro's Society Assembly, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely insignificant". His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José prepare the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their fight to control a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not seem to be willing to submit in his dispute to control the institutions of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the Shareholders meeting of 18 January this year, which has already been registered in the Commercial Registry.
The Society Assembly of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Madrid Commercial Court number 2 for the 16th, triggered a new thunder strike in the gun of the Álvarez family.
The call of the Judge to appoint the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convenience of the Society's Assembly.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of applicants - their five children - to allow the unanimous congregation of 18 January to be acknowledged by means of judicial tricks, fraud and legal abuse", as official speakers explained.
This argument is the basis for fighting the congregation afterwards to declare it as "absolutely nothing."
The same protagonists who were hiding in discreet silence tried without success in June to convene a congregation on a judicial basis.
With El Enebro - assets company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
However, the founder of the service group, according to family protocols, demands the right to use more than 51% of capital.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the treatment of the complaint for which no date has been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
The cars are improved with a real-time software.
Since the end of the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this read universe has been characterized by the speed of surprises and successes.
In the beginning, nobody gave attention to the newling and despite his steep upward performance during the last season, all took the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso at the end of November.
Without wishing to lower the capabilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the engine of Renault, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in his hands has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that brought the German company to the market for purposes that do not have to do with authorennes in 2007.
This computer program called PLM was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
It is intended to be a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi and the most famous commercial vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Siemens Industrial Division, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and perform the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and the tests.
Russian worm suggests that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the racing stables who could introduce up to three or four improvements in a season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 highly qualified young people are now employed. They carry out analytics and any possible changes to the racing car with powerful EDV systems.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull's racing cars, except the engine, for which Renault is exclusively responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production plants and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team can spend for its races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars in a 50 kilometers away from London.
It is two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are strongly restricted.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The staff comprises 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls' true Formula 1 - Hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer puts in the services of his participation on the race tracks, further protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose knowledge is equal to zero.
The technologist of the work, Steve Nevey, emphasizes that five years ago one could say that the progress in the F&E field for racing cars contributed to the victory of 50 percent and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology represents 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey recognises that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "not predictable gladiators".
HP will open 20 own stores with local suppliers in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) presented his first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty businesses with 80 to 100 square meters each, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the 16 existing sales areas in the multimark company, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairman of HP España, Helena Herrero, mentioned as an example of the rebuilt store at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, ownership of Pont Reyes, working with the HP for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales posts in Europe by 2010, of which 20 branches in Spain.
The first were dedicated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mrera did not want to reveal the coming new openings, but did not exclude Madrid from being the next goal.
The deputy chairman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy for loading opening is always the same. They rely on a local operator with experience and industry skills.
The North American company group advises this and takes over the exclusive charge equipment (with interactive products for mounting). In Europe all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of the shoppersonal.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising system and stressed that the exclusive sales agency network was intended to "optimize the customer service and the advice of small and small businesses on purchase and afterwards, even the packaging."
The Barcelona store has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An online service builds a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small enterprises and private customers, as the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'clause'
The management board member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
However, it forecasts that the interest margins which the banks try to compensate with increases in fees and loans prices.
Sabadell is expecting to catch a million private customers in three years - one still on the subject.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year Guideline in 2011.
The aim is not only to survive without taking advantage of public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by a million private customers - 700 000 if you deduct the customers who will lose the bank - which is the big challenge that this bank is facing, because it has so far dedicated more attention to its business customers than its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share in private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, namely efficacy, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will present it together with the annual final report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish goals in these difficult times, as all the plans of the banks have collapsed worldwide through the financial crisis.
Sabadell will conclude its four-year-old guide plan of Optima this year, initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended by one business year.
The customers who will leave the savings boxes are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed, 2011 would be a "sworn" year "with great range".
The manager assumes that Spain will only be "slow" from the crisis.
In addition, it would be "very difficult", in two or three years "creating work" - basic for the survival of banks.
Even if it assumes that the war for liabilities - which are punished the interest margins - is being deprived, the risk allowances that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions for the recovery of liquidity will already be depreciated as a compensation for decreasing profit margins.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on loans."
"We didn't turn off the hahn, but the interest differences are very high," admitted Guardiola.
On Thursday, Banesto issued the order to its branch network to restrict long-term loans and increase interest differences (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the stategy to "increase the fees", but "within a competitive framework."
Sabadell's Guideline is based on organic growth, even if the group does not exclude corporative businesses as always.
Not for nothing, he assures that in Spain "great companies are necessary."
"The next year everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "increasing" and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will use red figures.
He believes that the FROB could replace the money market in case of capital flows.
After ensuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he endorses the argument of some bankers who already prophesie a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that, in contrast to the incidents in June, it could be made possible to finance short-term repo transactions and thus to cover the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the savings boxes
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility that there could be a merger wave of the savings boxes and stressed the speed with which the industry is restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings stores began, several savings stores did not participate in the first phase. They held the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Sparkassenverband (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, insured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"The majority is completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was "made as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limited expiry that was set in earlier times, not now, under the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition of 45 savings stores with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million per year is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he stressed.
Olavarrieta said, "There were some unfinished opinions about the slowness of the process that revealed insidiousness and unwiseness," because "Banco de España urges us to conclude immediately before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems of Europe and "perhaps" of the world and added that those who doubt this "without deeper knowledge" did.
The manager noted that in the current economic conjuncture, we have to "make no concern" about the situation of the financial institutions and the savings banks, which have experienced a "very important" concentration process that will be carried out "as quickly as possible".
He also reminded the Spanish banks that the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July had been very good.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time set conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has submitted new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and small enterprises, regulating time-work companies, or repealing the 426 Euro support for unemployed persons who are not entitled to unemployment, until privatisation of 49 percent of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, as well as 30 percent of State lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as a responsible person who had provoked the current crisis.
How to understand these processes?
It should be preceded that Merkel's position is not a mistake of its public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany takes a fundamental new perspective on the design of our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large majority of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe, there are three possible ways to speculate from the crisis in Germany.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south should leave the euro area.
The second: The re-introduction of the German Mark - although it is now more likely to sound to Science Fiction - is supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third party: a reform of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; penalty of the countries overcoming the requirements; possibly the adjustment of payments in some countries, as well as the extension of the costs of potential adjustment to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been characterized for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government took a constitutional reform from the sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the interference between what Germany considered necessary (strength tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country when Merkel pushed out the decision to save Greece painfully.
At that time this was criticized strongly, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel will come up with a clear position, calling for a reform of the agreements of the European Union in order to allow the rescue of a country and at the same time committing private loans to carry part of the costs.
This position was devised as an anti-European position, as it drives the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, although somewhat sweet, has been adopted, and in the next months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to exceed.
It says all that, even if unpopular measures now need to be taken, the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist from this date onwards.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area where the countries infringing infringements are severely punished, can be forced to explain themselves incapable of payment and, in this case, to take part of the costs of the private sector.
Germany shows us that we need to take a tough growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the payment balance, as it was suggested by Spain in tree times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do badly not to understand.
It is not only about driving the government deficit down to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will pass more quietly.
And that we will use the possibilities offered to us until spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in its own house has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't look like it would change something.
Among the possibilities considered, the fact is that we should not exclude the euro area full of serious countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it has warned us.
Sports and rules
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show invention spirit, but not the will to avoid a sanction.
The elimination, which was supposed to be set up by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos), in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed about whether it was an unsportal act or not and whether both players might have to be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (her team had clearly won) and played several fouls so that the arbitrator showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction at the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter into the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee punished the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate about the depicted case goes back to the fact that a team of the Football Club Real Madrid (who in his hymn nobleness and honour presents and has punished his players for similar events on other occasions) played the main role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added a episode more to his long history than theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these acts constitute a regulatory circumference. In fact, this approach is adhering to the statutes of sport, but seems to avoid its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be examined.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the counterparts, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not a aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid that the infringing players take an unjustified advantage of the counter team. This also did not happen.
The paradox of the act of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand under wrongplay or rule circumference, because the circumvention of the rule has not been carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as striking as possible so that it is punished by the arbitrator.
The players waited and cheerfully accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringers took from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be stressed that the rival has not been brought into an unfavorable situation, nor has the advantages of the game been heated, because the obvious result of this action was that his own team had to continue playing with less players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because then the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, up to a certain degree of uncertain advantage, as the team could at some point also dismiss. Furthermore, the players with this approach receive a sanction and pass into the second card cycle, in which they are excreting cards with a card less than in the first cycle.
This is not so clear whether it is a real advantage.
In the end, such approaches do not object to the sports spirit, including strategic decisions, in order to make the utmost use of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to deal with sanctions (this would actually be a clear case of rule circumference), they wanted to choose when they were subjecting to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding a penalty or fleeing before her.
Although the border between invention and regulatory environment is blurred, I believe it is a clear case of invention.
I have the impression that polemic has been created due to two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provoked rule transfer.
The damage that has been attributed to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Offers for the customer catch for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year drops a lawn of reservations to the days 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and Christmas lottery, there is also a group dinner during the pre-feeding time that can be delivered to Barcelona's restaurant and leisure oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis, they solve a prize-offensive to catch the customer segment that represents the great mass: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, confirms the entrepreneurs and associations interviewed.
In order to make the accounting even more complicated, the calendar (silver falls to a Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of 13 December, with the result of a lawine of reservations from dinner at two top days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped the group dinner for household reasons.
In order not to refrain from this tradition, many workers pay it from their own pocket.
As the economy is, lowest prices are required, confirms the chairman of Barcelona's restaurant, Gaietà Farràs.
To date, the representative of the Dachverband does not dare to predict how the holidays will look this month.
"The people think about it forty times before they reserve."
"They want to go out, but they pay attention to the prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who "provide quality at good prices with good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are most demanded by EUR 25.
In the event of a survey in various central restaurants, it appears that the evening of December 17 leads the providers to the collapse.
The group Soteras says that the demands for this Friday with the intention to spend less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, who has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the personality of the calendar to preferable reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
With AN Grup, which leads El Mussol, Attic, Ququ and a total of 23 locals, optimism is not lost, since the second quarter the revenues have been blossomed again and good, even if concentrated on a few days' views for the Christmas business.
Sources of the group highlight that the 18th day will also be an overactive day with groups of friends who celebrate Christmas.
In the six group menus, a Christmas menu was added for 30 euros or more than price heat. You have the impression that the customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return you want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you see green sprays spraying, so the employees are invited again. This impresses the impression that the group dinners are re-established.
The deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel, and notes that the reservations are totally "liveful", although the customers are "supposing a maximum".
However, the fun of celebration has not declining, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani Nuclear Programme raises great concern in the USA
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "fast than any other country".
Illuminations of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks Internet Portal, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistanian nuclear programme Washington.
At the edge of the clarifying and juicy details that offer the documents on the content of the conversations and the thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between both countries is not strengthened in terms of nuclear security, but, on the contrary, "minded", and that the instabil Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistan nuclear program - that the weapons are not compiled, but are stored on their individual parts in order to make their destruction difficult during a possible attack - prepare Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks include the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear plants to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable dispersion of the nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implied in nuclear and missile programs is not only considered by the USA but also by Russia as excited and reason to take care of them.
"Pakistan has to set up strictly believers for the monitoring of nuclear plants; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to rectify people who work on nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev from the Russian Foreign Ministry in a discussion with its North American officials.
The new documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet Portal is that cooperation between the USA and Pakistan in the field of nuclear dissemination is slowing down and the increased pace in which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," explains: "Averages there are no transparency; we do not receive any answers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Secret Service for South Asia confirms that "through the economic disaster Pakistan produces nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
The ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to the responsible, that "Pakistan's army has to stop its silent oversight of terrorist groups."
On hunting for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revealings.
Interpol gives a red warning to the persecution and invention of assangs.
All that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can only be clarified difficult.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "finding and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest arrangement.
She's not new, she's from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the latest exploration of more than four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australians must face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures "the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
At the request of Sweden, the international police authority, based in Lyon, France, issued the order, but was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities.
So the things are. The 188 Interpol countries are required to identify and find assangs "to arrest and deliver it provisionally."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States, according to the organization, consider the red warning as a free letter for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - in particular if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to occur.
Assange's lawyers, who published a letter of gesteen, informed that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by means of a video conference.
They also recall that Assange applied for the departure from Sweden and was compared by the prosecutor who was granted the approval to Stalin with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," the letter accuses.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia defeats her son’s innocence - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silent.
On Monday, he gave the director of Time per Skype from an indefinite place from an interview. During the discussion, he requested the withdrawal of the US Secretary Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the arrangement of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus breached international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House’s Secretary of the Press, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation "shameful and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put on the opinion of a type with a website," he explained to the sender CNN.
Obama himself has entrusted a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, with the prevention of new documents.
The attempt of the speaker of the presided Barack Obama, Assange to pay less attention is contrary to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Congress delegate Peter King, who will be chaired in the National Security Committee of the House of Delegated Parties from January onwards, asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of setting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organisations, "to confiscate their funds and to follow anyone who supports them or contributes to them."
Tom Flanagan, advisor of Canadian president Stephen Harper, had gone further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "moorded".
"Obama would have to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned plane or something."
Anyone who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who made information through the government, he is guilty of betrayal, and everything that is not executed is too mild punishment," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercós is looking for peace in the ERC with a swink of eyes to the Carod Nearest Peace
The Republican leader allows the party to vote secretly on its continuity in the Office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralist government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for the twentieth time of an internal revolt in the series of after the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes of votes in the directionless ERC.
The party president is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for the closest of the former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that today the influence of this sector is as weak as its mentor itself and will not give him the same headbreaks as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with one eye, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the beginning yesterday, ERC’s more than 200 regional council members were able to express their secrets about their remaining in office.
With choice tablets, not with elevated hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss the president, they could do this without fear of repression.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of splitting as well as the impression of submission among his person.
In several interviews, he confirmed that he would feel uncertain with half the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod Neighbors demand more from the President than only to make its office available to the party. An inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the conventions.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force withdrawals, they will agree with the Management Board a plan of action from now to May.
For this purpose they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the Strategic Reorientation Document that the Board will submit to the Council on 18th.
Their intent is to break Puigcercós. In return, this promises to move the congress in the autumn of 2011, which the party's tip already considers to be a fact.
The party president of the ERC is of the opinion that the "Polyphony" harms the stability and strives for all time to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the official Conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovció considered it to be a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange against different objectives".
He counted up five, two of which are in the foreground.
First of all, the "renovation" of the Board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is to include new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great novelty.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally give up the principle of assembly as a functioning.
In this way he fights a reform of the statutes to allow the conventions to be held with selected delegates.
From the end of the assembly model - an exception to the Spanish party system - Puigcercós's team, which already fought for it at the last two conventions, as possessed.
Actually, the party leadership was commissioned at the prevailing 2008 assembly with the review of the principle of the assembly at a convention that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still out of place, as infogle of the internal rest of the past years has not been advisable to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors, the time could have come to reconcile this matter and finish it forever.

China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of China, at the COP16, said that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon tracks and it would maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country on the COP16.
During his first public appearance at the 16th World Climb of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon tracks and to change its industry.
He explained that in the last four years his country has invested $245 million to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, he said that China would not change its goals but would work on this matter together with the international community.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institutional development and pilot support.
In all aspects progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which contained the objectives of reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China the governments of the state had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he stated that some multiannual plans have been launched or completed, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those who received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the programme on the effective use of energy, which has been introduced over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
It also runs a provincial project on climate change, another to exchange traditional light bulbs through energy saving bears and another to weaken and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be much larger than generally accepted.
He pointed out that the greenhouse gas emissions per capita in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while it was 100 tonnes in the United States. China is responsible for a total nine percent contribution to pollution.
It also makes unprecedented progress in the field of energetic use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent in the last five years and another one is to be done by 2020, he said.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party Chairman has the right to contact the National Order Commission and to demand what the right to him is.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former president of the PAN had the right to contact the National Order Commission and to demand what the right to him was.
In an interview taking place before the complainant Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he explained that the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Herr Espino has the right in his case to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in order to make a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not time to think of 2012 and that an alliance to the Presidential candidates had never been sitting at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional was strengthened by the internal vote on 4 and 5 December in which his successor was elected.
"This (a alliance in 2012) is a subject that was never on the negotiation table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, he was successful and fulfilled his purpose," he stated.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "no fear of internal competition; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the one or the best chairman that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years. Therefore, he surrendered the stake "to the one that the Council would decide."
"I am quite unconcerned and open. I would be proud to transfer the office of the party chairman to each of the five."
He predicted that the revival of the party, recorded at the last elections of 4 July, would reflect itself in the next elections, although "it wasn't time to think of 2012."
"Now it is about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he emphasized that the three governments, which emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. That is why "a lot of hopes and longings are set in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the height of the requirements."
When he was asked about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón for his disc course under his four-year government, César Nava called on the followers of the PRI to reflect over the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin defending them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He believes that the owner of the Federal Government would like the expressions he could make in his discourse at Auditorio Nacional, because there was no mouth prohibition in this country and even less a censorship.
Obama is working in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this law," the President of the United States twittered in the popular social network.
Today, President Barack Obama supported the country-wide mobilization to support the Dream Act - Law on Legalisation of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog in the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this law," said Obama.
His short release contains a cyberlink to a more extensive document, which urges the public to enter into contact with its senators, as the voting of the law is in the near future.
"With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The message was disseminated after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except extending the tax reductions from the times of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockade, which was announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican Senators, could affect the coordination of the Dream Act Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the spread of nuclear weapons.
Questions about the blockade of the Republicans of Dream Act and other projects, the president Robert Gibbs said that he trusts that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set up for the other projects.
"I think we've got a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must be dealt with before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The chairman of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act - law, with which the initiative to legalise undocumented students could be voted in the Senate from the next Thursday, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the law of the American dream, would legalize about 800 000 young people who immigrate into the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, during the last five years living in this country and registered at higher education or armies.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, so they are dependent on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the proponents of this project organize an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, of which the majority support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar from Indiana, announced his support of the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act have to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats are to decide to turn back to the initiative.
Among the most popular Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had voted for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put your finger in your wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust to the Language' was a walk in which the participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated the Spanish-speaking literature and used the subtitle of her question at this time (on another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentine writer sucked to the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table that was moderated by Marisol Shultz, where Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and the Shultz then characterized as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for to learn what a "wond" is, and goes from a doctor to a doctor, from whom she does not answer but gets hints for the guide of her story.
The infectologist leaves her conviction: "Geduld is not my strength, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the dreamatologist who took her breath in the middle of the gang, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst uncovers the secret: "The wound is really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the story sifts and concludes that it only learned from the wound that it is really open and does not exist.But it is convinced that the desire in the language and its traps is mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented an enthusiastic story, which he called 'Lob of Invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
He tells of a famous magic woman who touched the clouds, brought back far traveled men or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The story made a turn of turning and reported of America, the great novel that did not lack his own chronists from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the flood of the stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), ridiculed the premature witnesses who appeared in the stories that were true, but in other ways the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, even the feeling of shame was lost."
However, he emphasizes, "is it the mad and liars who imagine things the best," and there, reality and lies approach each other, where you don't know to which side the story belongs, where the fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was in the row, the writer commented and praised the diversity of the interpretations to which the FIl had contributed to the round table 'The finger in the wound'.
The Cuban and Puertorican woman devoted their contribution to the great wound of societal violence, which affects her country, as well as the whole of Latin America, as a result of the fights for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, undeliberately planned commitment," she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and liability that builds between the author and the readers like a "chemical reaction".
The evening the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "the fingers of the engaged writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-lived world, the intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also go out on dogmatisms, and will forget, "that behind every confirmation is a little no and behind any denial a little yes."
"To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to nuancize: and nuancing often means to put your finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful ones who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noticed and invited to rediscover the sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles are confronted with their respective trainers, and their encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced Aufs and Abs in his career, but three times he has had crucial games, and so far he has kept himself well, so this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentineer has played up with the medal to the second champion, he has left a step behind the winners and, surprisingly, he has played successive final games with the same team.
The Santist Stratege reached the first final game as a trainer at the "Torneo Apertura 2002", when del Morelia had the swings in his hand, with which he learned a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003', he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to relapse, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros went unmistakeable after 210 game minutes, but at the elephant he came forward with 3-1 and got two options to insert his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two final games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. That's why he doesn't want to be persecuted again from calamity and free himself from the evil magic to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that for him the most important is the game itself.
"I want to become champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my affection, which I give myself, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important," commented the taxman when he was asked about the lost final games.
The last final game is still strongly in his memory, he assures that he has learned much from it: "The only lesson that we can draw from it is that until the arbitrator does not pitch the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players also, for the last time we were prepared with two elephant meters to separate, and I believe that this is a doctrine until the game is not finished, there is no occasion to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by elephant shooting, it does not worry, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the elephant shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense desire to keep the title already in the hands, which left us something for this end game, and we hope it will not come to it this time."
It is in Romanso power not to be just second champion and for the first time to cost the glory that the titles bring.
The USA amends the rules for the receipt of a visa
Persons must present themselves to the Visa Requests at the Consulate Council before their discussion; costs will be reduced in such a way.
As of 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying a visa in the Embassy of the United States and in the Consulates will change.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves in the Consulate at the Visa Request Services (ASC, the Initial Letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant which are verified by the consulate before the discussion.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the processing of the visa are reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the date agreement, the processing of the visa request and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterparty of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visa for time workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa shall not have to talk in the consulate, they must only present themselves at the nearest ASC where they present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Since the biometric data are collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second date for the conversation in the consulate remain less time than before.
Those who request the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer have to pay the service charge of $26.

NASA announces the Fund of Outer Earth Life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living in all.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States announced tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The Fund will be presented by experts in astrobiology at a press conference in the seat of NASA in Washington tomorrow at 13.00 p.m., which is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When calling for the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory find for the search for extraterrestrial life", which caused speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there could exist in hostile environments, which have been thought to be uninhabitable, human creatures. The hypothesis was raised that they could turn into intelligent creatures, as human beings, if their living conditions improved.
It appears to be a microbe found on the ground of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all the thoughtful forms of life, as the lake is strongly arsenate.
In any way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a resource of survival. Considering this ability, the chances are increased that there could be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
If these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proved that "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that differs from the one we know."
The Space Agency will announce the real scope of its find tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference.
At the conference, the geobiologian Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, studying the Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) in the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to the earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
The reform of the organ law on the Congress introduces the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and a opposition block was already installed, led by the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who proposed to be independent. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the opening session in the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo were waged against the reform of the organ law, as they were thus excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled the Congress.
These four Members, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only who voted against the president of the presidency, quoted by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political marginality with these reforms.
He pointed out that in the next days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. They went out of their political will and if they did not, they would be unjustified by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"But here I come (the opposition coalition), that's what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they don't even take consideration to take into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that after being monopolist, the Congress should now be "duopolistic".
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal two-party system in the Congress."
"From the beginning this group starts with five MEPs and they speak with other colleagues so that they can become more," said Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT led to PAN and PRI that the Congress had now turned into a 'Put' for two.
"Before it was only one party, now they divide them to two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the MEPs and to assign them their place to the negotiating tables.
"The five who are currently divided into different groups have decided to unite in order to take our place on the negotiating table because it has been reformed and agreed by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check over a little more than 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid to the owner of the electrical material company in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued on a amount of 200.144.56 peso with number 9258447 on last 16 November was issued with the purpose of "open accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent that more money from the community would go to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because she sold at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you owe her, and as a result the number of checks that are still being issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought from her, only the debt is paid, just as with the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
In the last quarter of the year, the last cheques "dive again": 24 September, two of 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last of 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid requesting other administrations for its services, the Treasury assured that its services would not be re-established.
After the review of the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on July 25, the Noroeste newspaper announced that from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks to Camacho Palazuelos.
It also took place stores with Jumapam, where she entered cheques worth more than 3 million peso.
Tourist places need to be penetrated
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourist industry requested special attention to the authorities, the areas that are in a bad state and throw a bad picture on the harbour city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada dealer association, recalled that at different occasions it was required to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find to new jobs or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the streets and walkways had been negative, as tourists came to the veil and saw the disorder, and they would turn to the nearby stores.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they would not carry out the construction work in this way slowly and unplanned."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the breakdown of the tourist would have made the attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance of the city.
"The community has to take over its responsibility and avoid doing so again. How to do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of improving everything afterwards," he said.
"We long for a clean city, because not only because it is a tourism area, it needs to be maintained, we also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration needs to change its strategy to maintain the city in a good condition."
"There are other places that look unpleasant and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito from Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertisements to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps tourist attractions constantly in shoe," he added.
"These provisions have not been given enough attention, and this kind of incidents expose what is obvious to all: Maintenance is urgently necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán because they would not be properly used and made a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought along with the city on the front. Making the city clean, proper and attractive for tourism should be priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that must first be cleaned up and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and to provide them with the inventory we advertise for this destination.
IP calls for results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, suggested that the MEPs should take over the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
The Mazatlán company is calling for a worthy Parliament, free of agreements between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and faces major problems.
The 60th Parliament was devoted yesterday, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI MEPs, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PTs, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM. This is a total of 40 people representatives.
The new members of the Congress are expected to work cleanly, to feel obliged to society and to the different social groups, which are dependent on responsible parliamentary work, and that they do not repeat the same patterns of partyality and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Undertaking Coordination Council, proposed that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility to give an example of a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
"We hope that the MEPs truly exercise their right to act freely of agreements between the parties, because it is common that they make agreements with which they represent their own interests, turning into carnival comparatives of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We make sure that they carry out a trustworthy work and put themselves to society and their groups above all, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Hotel Association of Tres Islas, says one of the major challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is the drive and joint work for the state's economic growth, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote the creation of jobs."
With regard to the tourism industry, he asked the new MEPs to give them the necessary role in the government budget to promote the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second few resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchanges and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agro industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated to funds, the state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Searching for Holy King
Puppen, cars, bikes and other toys want the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for parents to meet these wishes on the next three-country day, because the budget does not consist more and not less of twelve people and a goatbow.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up the hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and the clothes that they so see.
The family inhabits a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no firm work.
"Sometimes hard times are said because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... I'm going with the gören to sell on the street, already in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle while her three-year-old sister Isabel wanted a barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted a 'monster car' for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana is proposing clothes in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, "I would like this monster so much," but I answered him, "let us wait, boy," because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were at school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size of 12; the ten-year-old Isaías is the size of 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Heilige König wird gesucht' by spending a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, in the context of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis around the ten house searches in the administrative region Estrie were carried out.
Fourteen persons were arrested and will be charged with different charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the most predominantly drug production was supposed to have served.
"Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment served by production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom were from Sherbrooke, the main draggers of the drug ring.
The arrested persons should have appeared hours after their arrest before the judicial building in Sherbrooke.
They could be accused, among other things, of the accusation of the production of cannabis, whose possessions for sales purposes, of the complot and of the service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a long-term investigation activity, which was going to take place for over a year.
"The information received from public hand has enabled us to carry out these arrests," explained M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers of the regional investigation unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Office and Memprémagog had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be pursued easily
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the government, is intended to address the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be taken into account after the three opposition parties have announced on Wednesday that they cannot approve the proposal.
"I lean up against this charter with a strong emphasis."
"I hold with a party that has put you at your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the end of the weekly Caucas session before the assembled MEPs.
The Liberals claimed to hold the draft law, which allows for each person coming from a ship that is identified as transporting illegal immigrants for up to one year, injures the Canadian legal and freedom constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, Chief of Bloc Quebécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law because he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait for what the government does," M. Duceppe said.
The criticism of the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has rejected the critics who demand that their party be held steadfastly enough to the secret immigrants.
"The Neo Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and we try to enforce this by means of another draft law, the C-35," Chow stated.
We therefore do not support the draft law of conservatives because he seeks the debt of refugees and keeps children caught for at least one year," said Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians urgently inform the MEPs that they do not tolerate this type of secret immigration, these criminal activities affecting Canada and treating the country as a footwear."
"They expect Canada to take hard measures," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its draft law, which could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative person has said to the QMI agency that the government would call for a voting so that every opposing MEP would immediately explain to its voters.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new, standing unit for the fight against corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to demand the establishment of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea does not come from yesterday: Quebec had consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropole has a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Nevertheless, the Wednesday announcement has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite Robert Dutil's presence.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, critics and member of the Québécois Party, qualified this announcement in pointo public security as "out of the hat furnished rabbit" and "rightly brushed solution" at a table end.
On the other hand, Minister Dutil had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the future unity in question.
"They will see the result when we will announce it," he reaffirmed.
"You are aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest persists in trying to prevent the formation of this investigation committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only way to form an investigation committee is to resign Jean Charest," Yves Boisvert, Professor for Ethics and Political Systems at ENA (stately University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this sackgasse, he proposes to Quebec to grant a special mandate for financial audits so that it can investigate related research on corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to expand the mandate of testing," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could grant the same power as Commissioners, which would allow them to commit people to the statement.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest boards of the government.
The Quebec will also demand from Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better geared to this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the Supreme Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisdiction in this way is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of Public Security, confirmed his colleague of the Justice, Rob Nicholson, at present with certain novelties related to this file.
During the Operation Printemps 2001, which covered the groups of motorcycle policemen, 131 persons had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been novelised.
As a result, Ottawa has enforced the law against Gangstertum.
Rivers under strict monitoring
Several river runs continue to be under strict guard due to the high rainfall that has occurred since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, there was an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventively evacuated.
In the evening another earthruch took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, strong rainfalles of 40 to 70 millilitres have dropped over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 millimetres of rainfall was expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouai region were most affected.
There had been a total of up to 100 millimetres of rain showers.
Since these precipitations have to be added to the snow melting that has already accumulated in certain subdivisions, the transition of several water runs is feared.
On Wednesday evening, warnings about the flooding alarm concerning the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in the region of Lanaudiere were issued by the Quebec Security Service.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière will be the object of overseas monitoring and continue to be observed.
In the region of Lanaudière, the severe rainfall has moved to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a fall-back bridge was pushed down due to the strong rainfall.
Ten residents had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais the crossing of certain lakes has caused the locking of several streets, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service continues to be in alarm and monitors the situation precisely, says Security Council Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, Quebec’s highwater centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially corrected
The Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial relapse in front of the Canadian Supervisory Board for Radio Standards (CCNR) because of its controversial statements on social care and Haitian as well as because of its insignificant speech on radio.
The CCNR believes that M. Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 FM team would have included the right to express their own opinions, but that certain statements would have included "inaccurate information on the social care and unlawful negative representations of the Haitians as well as such unrestrained speech that is not appropriate to the broadcasted broadcasts during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which includes the dissemination of the names of two persons committed suicide, violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR received several complaints concerning the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasting missions.
The first decision was lodged as a result of a complaint of the "Front commun des personnes assistées socials du Québec".
The activist organisation had complained that the amounts referred to in the consignment were inaccurate.
The moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
With regard to the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had the opinion that suicide was an expression of figness.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had drawn the conclusion that the message provided was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the questionable consequences of the "Dupont le midi" mission would have addressed a sensitive theme in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was not punished with any offense against his person.
The last point was the statements concerning the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had made a media-efficient dispute that caused a lot of reactions in this regard.
The CHOI moderator had explained not to have donated in favour of Haiti aid, as one would not be sure whether the needy would really receive the money donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not misusual, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
"I have already cut off my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
"My file has been a virgin for one and a half years," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board shall dictate the dissemination of an unrestrained expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted "in addition to its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, should have communicated its decisions once during the main end-time within a period of three days, are minor.
A king of the Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlet, brilliant in "Sanda" (Vollkontact Kung-Fu), in the kickboxes and in the Thai boxes, is now increasing in the search for new challenges to the Tatami and the box rings of the world.
"I started in Algeria 12 years ago with fighting sports such as Kung-Fu and Kickboxen," Zemmal, who has been located in the metropolis since 2008 to develop under the professionals.
I personally search for the fight of all places, since for those who present the soil struggle, as the mixed fighting arts present it, are rare in North America."
Recently, his sign as a security officer and the company UPS employed had given his rivals bad news, in which he made two gold medals of the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) during the World Championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, held between October 23 and 30th.
"I have gained the victory in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he said.
"At the moment, I'm preparing for the world population in San Shou in China."
"There were those fighters from every category who had been placed at the last world championship among the first four."
"I babe picked up in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"In 2005, I became behind in Vietnam."
"2007 I finished the tournament in China at the fifth place while I became third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm I will become the first one this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, where fuses and footsteps are allowed as well as soil werfens.
The two fights usually play on a platform, more rare in a box ring.
The most renowned box fighter, which has come from this kind of fighting sport, is the American Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, probably known in the world of fighting arts.
If Nacer Zemmal retained only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the super tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and most respected one in China," said the sympathic poundshell.
"It's a little like the equivalent to the Lumpinee stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal won his first battle in the half-final of his category (80kg), before losing it in the finale.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the half-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer themselves the forehead to crown a single champion, the king of the Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has agreed to grant $450 million contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this lawine of more than 100 contracts, there is a consortium consisting of companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely the project leadership, to a total of 295 million dollars without arrangement.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a accompanying appearance of the decision by Hydro-Québec, to the private sector, to overreact to this important hydroelectric project of a total of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the "Énergie gérance" consortium joined the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that implies the risk of distortion of competition and an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of a carded game and defences competition."
"This means that instead of carded games are being carried out in a secret form now in an open form," said Sylvain Simard, PQ representative at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the public's interest can be used in this way.
Minister of Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, had responded in the afternoon by remarking that this treaty would have taken place in a carded game.
"I stay faithful to my line," she waged by strengthening that the PQ was "unreasonable" and it "missed her of hardness".
She said it was the least that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to bundle their experts on a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity with regard to its utmost work.
The construction process is in progress and is to be established until 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competition struggle, and there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is no longer an exception even for relatively simple projects.
Last week, as the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted, the model of the consortium used in the field of construction engineering and consultancy is the subject of government statements.
A brief crossing of the Quebec company register allows it to designate more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, among which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult are included.
Each link, and there are several dozens, leads to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As far as the "Énergie gérance" consortium is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the many James has been subjected to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has given this fact in particular account since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has caused the nose about the facture that the contract on the project leadership was approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be faster."
"So you have two ways: either you take the people who are on this Mart and tell you, you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that not the price is crucial, but the fact of the individuals," said Laporte.
This contract granted to the "Énergie gérance" consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received from the Québécois Party.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" included more than 100 engineer and consultant contracts, which were approved by companies or their branches, including resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had acquired 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had said that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had claimed that the PQ was equally associated with the companies that they "financed" before she clarified that it was rather their leaders.
Barometer Responsible Consumers - The "green" label is not trustworthy
Greener but unrelented skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but also little in the marked brands or ecomarks to control its choice.
In a media-efficient universe, there is just as much shame of information for a more responsible consumption: the barometer conscious consumption has a lack of credible information to complain, an inadequacy that makes itself known as a brake of his commitment, as shown in the first reading that was held yesterday.
Although they have promoted the consumption of so-called socially compatible products in 2010, the Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admit that in fact, to give as little faith to the environmental gain of companies as the green company advertising, the measured instrument, elaborated by the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthyness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves as environmentally conscious, says the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by just 14.6% of the Quebec population.
The information about responsible consumption seems also important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently maintained by nearly one third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, empty and doubtful character of the information defeated the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, one third of the Quebecers is disgusting about the performance of the green products and services they are endeavoured.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and primarily changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their convictions.
According to Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from dealers in their city district and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and responsible conscious - the index of the environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as king of recycling who tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by caring for animal protection.
However, social and ecological consciousness seems to stop its car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated, used public transport in 2010, or have preferred the driving centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants supported this comprehensive policy survey, which feeds the clichés.
State bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec Government, which was invited by the Société Angus and the Parallèle company to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus, as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, to re-extract it from its actual Cineastic function, apparently does not receive what they demand.
Although the government has accepted to involve in this matter, on its own conditions.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec Government offers a loan in less than the initially expected amount that could create an existing solution to beneficial conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources taken from the state odour.
A first action plan, as well as a request for 12.8 million, had already been rejected from Quebec's last spring, and the bitt request has been corrected down again in a sum.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister of St-Pierre, who heads the eXcentris Act.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final fact report.
However, the counter proposal of the cabinet was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have time to answer them until 31 December.
In any case, the premises of the state donation seem to have been really forced to be the side.
Let us remember that the Quebec ownership community of cinemas and cinema complexes had refused to support a direct state investment in supporting the acquisition of eXcentris by submitting the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects there that he had not also received other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained substantial economic aid.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois had presented the author’s cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulties, which could justify the exception of the state cheese.
The lack of cinemas that show independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to hold his client at the rod.
The Société Angus, as well as the Parallèle company with Christian Yaccarini at the top, operate a privately funded campaign, from which they hope a sum of $700 000 to stimulate the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one canvas continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinemas on February 27 next year with the performance of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not dismissed the newspaper "Le Devoir" and is ignored what he and his group think of the down-corrected proposals they have made.
Secret of complex shaking Canada ventilated
The new American diplomatic guides, spread by WikiLeaks, ventilated the secret of what the United Nations deemed to the Americans under the minority complex of the Canadians; but with the same blow, they open up the superiority of the latter to Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have the Canadian-American relations in the sense of the election, and they believe that the visit of President Obama would have helped the Conservative Government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more details than the mere material content to which one has to knabble.
A link dating from 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was in full progress, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participate in the actions discussed by its political leaders.
For the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador used in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations for this situation.
"The Canadian, political leaders may be much more likely to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to postpone the United States to the black Peter (such as 1988 in the campaign on free trade) in this election," he describes.
Thus, the United Nations, he concludes, are "the speaking Goliath of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him".
The ambassador understands this "ear-bearing silence" even less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he evaluates, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in the sense of the course."
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the communication sent by Terry Breese, businessmen in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa on 22 January 2009.
"Your journey will help to ensure the continuation of the government's voting of confidence over the Federal budget in early February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, resulting from a rebellion programme of $30 to $40 billion," Breese describes.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to postpone the parliamentary meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being crashed by the coalition and the so-called persistence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed rebellion programme.
Another communication written by the Ambassador Wilkins dating from January 2008, Washington communicates the ever-negative picture that the dramatic series emitted through CBC spread from the United States.
The ambassador is worried about missions such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little subtle speeches can be observed to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also deductions for the purpose of CIA's muscles.
Another communication is a detailed report on how Hillary Clinten asked her French colleague Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to take up certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question yes, but on the basis of an individual case-by-case decision.
À to the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed a paper to the Secretary of State in puncto Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, let us note that the minds of the WikiLeaks website are heated.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close-standing consultant, had explained about CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "reduced".
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States here.
Worldwide plan for renewing lighting
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), which corresponds to nearly one third of the additional reductions that must be achieved in order to stabilise the earth’s climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of concrete large projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of compelling industrial reduktion obligations.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, the main problem in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the earth illuminated FCKWs would be avoided if the white-blowing pears, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better, by light diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet park.
Last year, in Copenhagen, the major exhaust emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed voluntary reduction plans to reduce global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From this balance, however, one should still deduct 5 Gt to stabilise climate rise by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020, in order to prevent it from exercising control.
In the white-blowing pears 95% of the energy deviates in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced by twice again.
The compact light bulbs keep between 6000 and 10,000 hours in average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those that manufacturer Philips has placed on the market this week - this society has, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consumes 80% less energy than a white-blowing pear, which gives an end to the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that this completely new glow bears give very little heat, they can also work with a rule resistance.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact light bulbs have reserves, since they contain mercury and that they have to be disposed of as a special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries except the producers provide an acceptance point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact light bulbs, but rather the coal power plants that emit much more mercury to produce the electricity consumed by the white-glowing pears.
In the United States alone, these coal power plants are 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report outlines the profits that each country would earn thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save a billion dollars annually when buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal power plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Excited Announcement of Election Results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for "indefinite" publication of the results of the Elf Coast Presidency's Elevation Selection immediately after their expiry.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need of the independent Election Commission to receive their work and to announce the provisional results without further delay," said a press speaker of the UN Chief.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to prove their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until proclaiming the provisional results."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Election Commission had left the Deadline, fixed on Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without publishing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI on television confirmed that the Commission would "continue working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday several calls from all over the world have become loud, the CEI may finally call the name of the winner of the second election round under the Laurent Gbagbo divorced and its opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp counts on the cancellation of "treacherous" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failure of the Putsche in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the ivory coast, had confirmed that the manövers practised by the FN to intimidate the voters in the north of the country had deteriorated the leaders of the President to go to the election.
The whole choice could be cancelled if the complaints lodged by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparts now consider that the Supreme Court of Justice is not neutral because he is directed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected person with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who dismisses any connection with the ex rebels, has considered the delay in proclaiming the electoral results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to demand the victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results, as he knows he has lost; and submit a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after preventing the Election Commission from publishing the results, was illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held for the crowning of the association and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over the years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the politicians of the ivory coast that it could be held responsible for them in the event of possible excitements.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election round on October 31, with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédie (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable 9.3% in the metropolis within the meaning of the International Labour Office (IAA) (including overseas departments at 9.7%), as shown by the provisional seasonally adjusted information published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The second quarter's data amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In the beginning, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter but wished to find a job, including whether they were employable every two weeks or not or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25%, including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between 15 and 24 years of age were unemployed according to the IAA.
Seniors, on their part, have a slight rise in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 years had been able to benefit from unemployment stability in the third quarter, 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute on its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office of Inseas has no longer published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
However, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced a 9.8% quota in France on Tuesday (including overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposable company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), an investigation procedure was initiated and he was introduced to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of a investigation procedure on public and fraud-approved markets.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of the suppression of societal assets, confusion of general goods, healing, mediatorship in corruption, unauthorized bribery and weapons possession, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and is planning to talk to all the questions that the prosecutor will ask him rather than to spread brain spins."
"It's easy to submit to him a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agence France Press) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) in the department, had deemed to give the judge a memorial to his justification by means of his lawyers before his hearing.
A family member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to the lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keeping his deposit, which he had to lead, running.
With regard to the business competence area or the destination of the related funds, he would never have known, says Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Balling Area Aubagne, was also charged on Wednesday for submission and complicity, but then resumed under the charge of keeping himself away from the protagonists of this act under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to explain the facts he had been accused of."
"The executive prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four more persons were charged and were released from prison from Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under jurisdiction, according to Deputy Supreme Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is judicially pursued because of "unauthorized influence and passive bribery".
Two government officials of the Aubagne Balling Area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, which was one because of the title "Intercourse and confusion of general goods by a public service officer", the other because of "membership in confusion of public funds".
The life companion of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "healing and subsistence of social property".
Among the persons opposite Guérini are Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained because of a similar affair of fraudulent crafts from public hands that had affected Corsica.
The fountains suspected his society to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for suspected fraud in the award of public procurement, in particular in the disposal sector, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous lettering in the documents of several open investigation procedures.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation concentrates in particular on the conditions of the concession and operation of a deposit in La Ciotat, which also relates to waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the city's Marseille (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde rice: the Elysée palace transmits its middle function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was arrested in Iran for "Spionage", held the French public in breath, put diplomacy into alarm preparation and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
All of this under the attentive views of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and viewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans his strategy to give these advice on dealing with their own crisis of hostages in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French controllers tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not seek the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and the American jurisdiction on the basis of trade in material in favour of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde rice, in a cruel light.
In truth, he had done nothing in this respect.
A diplomatic telegraph, edited in Paris on 12 August 2009, is entitled "Iran: French Comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée Adviser on Strategy Questions, spoke with Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained the French method.
They advised the Americans to make everything possible to bring back their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"May noise," they said, "returns loud and clear and without delay" the words "principal rights", "innocence", "continuous release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to his image.
"Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do this."
Because "silent silence does not solve anything" passes the discussion attempts over inconspicuous ways, the Iranians are "masters in avenues".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a "conventional, Iranian tactic" "isolation for the purpose of political depression".
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was to be made on August 16, on the day she fled into the French embassy) "who pays a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euro deposit).
And he makes it clear that the Elysée anticipates other hostages, a phenomenon that "will make it sharper".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been released from prison 12 days ago, but is still held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose delivery the United States demands to Iran due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after a decision of a judge in Paris.
Like many other observers, the American message asks questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which pursues the illegal Iranian networks of acquisition of the material intended for the nuclear programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France purchased a cow trade?
The Iranian liberation against the French?
On 4 September, on the occasion of another discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the Judge's decision", but also attempted to refute itself against it.
"There has been a rainy exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister for Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier also wishes to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "hard" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a telephone number, re-establishes, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranians "to date in the buildings directed by the Iranian Embassy in Paris".
During the observance of Clotilde rice in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make "flight attempts" organized by the media, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influential middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation produces fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating August 25, 2009, "the media flash of the French authorities" cites up.
On what is so much "thank witnessing" to Mr. Assad, the Paris Embassy asks himself.
"The French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that the Elysée has led to the fall of this fiction.
He analyses the intensive communication efforts "to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria."
A policy launched in 2008, which at that time was "previous and unworthyly perceived by numerous criticism votes in France and abroad".
"The Syrian role builds up" attempts Paris to "consider Syria with what promisance one can achieve by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sown twins between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from good source.
On August 11th, François Richier entrusted her: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians did whatever."
"But we thanked them despite everything."
"This should at least cause confusion with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thankes the President of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for her "active role in the liberation of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Ashbrödel", which will forbid young people to play online games after midnight by preventing them from access, so the government responsible.
A draft law to call on the online game operators to prevent young people under 16 years after midnight of access to these games will be presented to Parliament in December, suggested representatives of cultus and family ministries.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulties with learning at school and also with having a normal life throughout the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure its health and right to sleep," said Jo Rin, the Ministerial Officer of the French Press Agency Agence France Press, with this draft law.
The online gamings will then be available again from 6 p.m. in the morning.
For a year, the manufacturers would have been preparing for the application of the law, so he clarified.
The government also insisted on requesting the manufacturers to cut down the daily time limit for access to these games to the young people whose parents ask for it, added the controller.
He will also provide free programmes to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also unfounded champion in global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea had earned four gold medals in the World Cyber Games compared to 58 other nations.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the Judge Country
In a bright excitement due to corruption, the Executive Committee of FIFA appoints on Thursday the Ecclesiastical Countries of World Championships 2018 and 2022, a highly political choice in which arranging for influence and lobbying threatens to penetrate the technical criteria in the background.
One thing is sure, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s Royal Discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional highburg (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 issue will then be more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Katar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch head of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) presents the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop up to the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important to the 22 members of the Exekutive Committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the enthusiasms, could also have ruined the chances for their own country, weighing the football, which was only one time the world championship, namely 1966.
The BBC had given the nutritional floor again on Monday by sending a documentary report that takes three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to annoy the FIFA and embarrass the English responsible who, in the last few weeks, had mainly lobbyed intensively with David Cameron.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the chess train succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to revise the image of England before the committee?
Nothing is less safe, because the Duo Spain-Portugal does not lack drumping with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the English as well as the doubts about Solvency in Spain and Portugal increase the opportunities of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the dossier (Stadia, Hotels, Transport) has become a weighty outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided that the Commission's members would condemn unfair competition in the preparation of the vote on the claims of the English press.
"You throw them with dirty, you try to compromise them," Poetin betted.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA headquarters, the country seems to have a long list of advantages compared to Japan and South Korea, which separately have set up a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidates seem premature for two countries who had joined the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the grant of the World Cup 2026 requested by FIFA for China, which causes the Asian chances to fall to 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had drawn all the registers with the waiting of futuristic stadiums, FIFA pursues its expansion to new areas, but these two countries are a greater risk than certainty.
Australia as well as Japan and South Korea may suffer from the weakness of television rights, which has been acquitted by the European countries, due to time shifting, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second Mandate: Publicity
The Gaulle had really stolen.
In the middle, he had believed he was silent.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the least hesitate.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée calls the next one.
The current Head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
But the manifestity is not well faced with the side of the mystery, which holds the presidential function.
So you have to do as if the doubt would exist.
In one sense, as in other sense.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chiracs claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in serious tone to make his decision "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée before the UMP Parliamentaries he would make the perspective of "two mandates" appear, therefore, had spread a little feverfulness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
We're missing.
The President simply reminded that the 2008 Constitutional amendment restricts the number of five-year periods to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election at such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You have only seven and a half years with me, or at best," he told them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the phase afterwards."
His words from yesterday do not make him a candidate more than the day before; but not less.
Should they produce comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidature with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the inclusion of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy drives to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidateship in 2012, which many members of the PS encourage more early than accepted to fight announcement.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, the electors of the rights would prefer a candidateship of François Fillon from Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," responded immediately and carefully to the Prime Minister's environment.
"If he would be a defeat as possible, he wouldn't be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin told.
"He will always believe in being able to victory," correctes Alain Juppé, who has found himself with the manifestity.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of state papers
The last meeting of the Governing Council of Central Banks last year should offer opportunities to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy to come to its conclusion at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European state debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt certainly cannot afford to deal with the current, more than tense situation on the European bond markets in order to avoid their worsening.
Political costs would be far too high.
The French Minister for Finance, Christine Lagarde, had yesterday welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in the solution to the European state budget debt.
It did not dare to say whether it believes that the Central Bank could do more, for example by stimulating its programme of procurement of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...).
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels on the preceding day at his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, had shown himself not very much in favour of his projects, but was pleased to point out that the programme of the purchases of state papers on the secondary market would "optimise" and that we will see "the outcome of the decisions" at the meeting on Thursday.
Only certainty: The ECB will leave its guiding interest unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Board of Treasury were doubled from the ECB last week to approximately EUR 1.35 billion.
And according to the indiscretions of some dealers, she should have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese state papers yesterday.
Since May 2010, the central banks of the Eurosystem have made purchases of EUR 67 billion.
Under the dealers, the anticipation of a further follow-up of the purchase price is no doubt (see page 29).
The Volkswirts are already expecting no remarkable change in the course.
If the borrowing transactions of more than three months will already have disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still create free-duty reserves in the unlimited amounts of funds over a period of one week up to three months.
The peoples are already concerned that this measure will continue to extend by a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way."
"Otherwise, she would risk provoking new tensions in the short term," said Michael Schubert, Volkswirt der Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit scheduled for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," reciprocated Norbert Bräms, Volkswirt bei Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the field of their interventions on the public debt market, "the ECB must maintain such a volume of purchasing bonds that live on the tragic market," Norbert Bräms adds.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the euro area markets, the central bank has no choice but to keep its presence on the market.
"It must act on the market at every price to the stakeholders of the lacking investors, and so act to prevent the rapid enthusiasm about the yields paid to the weakest states," a major holder of bonds yesterday testified.
For if the interest rates were to be applied to the altitude flight, the States would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The Government of Berlusconi goes in coverage in Italy
After the start of an alarming week for Italy, the situation last night, with the decline in corner interest rates to ten years, has been a little relaxed.
A return to deceitful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents of Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and had heard it with a "unpredictable" weekend, but that the person immediately said.
In any event, on Tuesday, the Schere with the German interest rates had reached its record of 210 base points, and the prices of the contracts for covering the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, resulting in some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that the difference between Spain and the German interest rates was at 400 basic points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed himself as "severely concerned" by the "market turbulences" and a potential risk of infection from the direction of Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at the Hudson Institute.
It is clear that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the resulting dwindling tax inputs that threaten the State to no longer be able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
An Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected in the future... although the budget available at the Senate for examining is expected to be 1.3% or 2%.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates that the budget deficit will be 4.3% of GDP in the next year (at the rate of 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, a new household collective, which could be used for a sum of 7 billion euros after the holidays.
"If necessary, new savings must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the hour, Italy receives support from international institutions.
"The basic festivals of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustees of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted to the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.d.R.), Italy demands lower stabilisation progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, head of the OECD.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion for a motion for a resolution by the Chamber of MEPs, which could organize the preferred elections already at the end of March.
There is therefore a little favorable period for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about the expansion of anticrisis measures
Christine Lagarde had expressly stressed it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think it was proven on Sunday afternoon and in the evening: the Europeans are clearly holding together, willing and committed to defending their currency and their currency area."
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest ties of the European State Obligations was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, there can be no mention of a start of normalisation.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt note, probably the most effective target of the speculants today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perception, which is particularly affected by the banking systems," says the People's Board of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "the political time is much slower than that of the markets".
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that it presents, are intensifying discussions on strengthening the existing anticrisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected financial ministers and, in a further sense, with their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
And this also in view of the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan is based on the loss of unconventional measures to strengthen the backs of the eurozone countries in the crossing of markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already launched its Asia Tour in Singapore on Tuesday to inform the investors in Fernost about the developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not expressly fund raising, he surely prepares the terrain for this.
The first advertising paper spending on the EU Stability Fund is planned for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative of the Agency Reuters had entrusted, the United States supported a possible increase in the IMF's additional, direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, are sending themselves to take over structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to saving measures, but should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland.
Both the one and the other are at every price to avoid calling for international assistance before they have set up their own budget corrections and decided on indispensable structural reforms that will bring them back their trust in the long run.
In turn, European investors are talking about the options available to speed up the normalisation process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on the doorway in Paris on 24 November, first expressed the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to resume its own pocket.
Mr Barclay's Capital's people judged that, with regard to the market of the European state debt, the stakeholder would be sufficient to extend the 100 billion euros, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity syringe.
This means: the European mechanism of financial stability, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has all the chances to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions are growing.
Snow and glatteis: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
The snow-episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of the Bretagne and threaten to affect different economic activities.
Four and twenty departments are now in alarm level orange due to the threatening risk of snow and glatteis.
The regions of yours, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have added the 20 departments already in alarm level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers tanger the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it easily cuts on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow covers are expected from 2 to 5 cm, as well as from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions include Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are significant enough to cause traffic disabilities and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are locked for heavy traffic of over 7.5 tons, including the traffic axles Guingamp Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of secondary transport networks in the Bretagne is very difficult, according to the traffic police who refuse to use their own vehicle only in emergency cases, and the use of some TER travel buses has been deleted throughout the day.
In the picardy, school traffic was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires the drivers to the highest caution on the streets and to adjust their driving behaviour."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) invited airlines to delete 25% of their flights from the Paris Airport of Roissy on Thursday and 10% of Orly's flights due to the expected strong snowfalls.
The DGAB recommends that the passengers contact their airline.
The airports of Gatwick in the south of London, as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are locked until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on modernisation of the transport industry has been in full progress on the Ile-de-France, it rains billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, we recall the 23 billion for Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to guide the start of the construction of the SGP, the State has called a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to grant a part of the financial sum on the markets for its twofold.
Today, it has finally come to first bills.
The supplementary budget of 2010, this morning covered by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, sets out the measures planned to impose the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on the creation and taxation of offices on the Ile-de France.
In the first place, Article 15 of the draft law goes "in favour of the public-law site Société du Grand Paris".
This is compensated: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
Secondly, it is a reorganization of the existing company taxation: "to modernize it to increase the product resulting from it and to overreact this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
A mystery.
This sum is not limited in the text.
From the 4 billion you're far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital dotation imposed by the State and that the Société du Grand Paris is gradually provided for the project," the explanation should be taken.
With the SGP, this system is not insulted at all.
"Since the moment you have booked revenue (the two taxes, that is, R.), you can cover the projection for over three years and then only create out of the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started to note the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions are still to be sought for a long time, is at risk of provoking a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Racious hackers and emspicious spiders
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it has unpopped itself as an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the mind of hypocrisy, which rules the relationships between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level and gives a taste for the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead of the row.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (a x-advanced nation) consists exclusively of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary", American exposures about the sexual habits of Berlusconis throw nothing more off than what one has been reading over months anyway in any x-popular journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifying caricatured profile Gaddafis offered cabaret artists for a long time material for their sketch.
The rule, after which the secret dossiers may only consist of already known news, is essential for the dynamics of secret services, and not even this century.
If you go into a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will recognize that every work (on the gral, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templers or the Rosenkreuzers) is repeating exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not solely because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (even so that he did not know where to find news about the non-existing) but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Likewise the secret acts.
The informant is faul, and faul (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service (other than he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers to be true what he recognises.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American embassy in Rome had sent to the state decree, were the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such a renewal made about the revealing of these dossiers?
On one side, these say what every educated person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of World War II and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representation tasks, have transformed into spionage centers.
Every spectator of research films knows this very precisely, and it does not happen from hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put the American diplomacy into a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that a x-popular hacker can seize the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a major blow against the prestige of the state deceased.
In addition, the scandal brings the victims less than the "sharp judges" in distress.
But we devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once, at Orwell's time, you could bundle all power like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has been able to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction carried out, the visited hotel, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
However, if one considers what happens today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control run stops being one-sided and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as a vengeance of the citizen - can experience the secrets of power.
How, though, can a power be held that is no longer able to preserve its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Shimmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of secretis, since it gives the public sphere; but in WikiLeak's style revealing that the mysteries of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this infringement that has been added to such a mighty one?
It is obvious that in the future, the States will no longer provide any information reserved on-line - that would be like a slope attached to the street corner.
But it is just as obvious that it is forgiving with the current technologies to be able to keep confidential reports on the telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than to find out whether and when a head of State has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be held in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction sounds at the moment to science fiction and romantic, but I see myself obliged to imagine the government agents, moving in a secret way on uncontrollable march routes, hiding their messages nowhere else than in a mere memory with themselves, and also the few written information they have received in the shoe debit.
The information would be stored in single copy in closed drawers: basically, the watergate spionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer today, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes enabled the film researchers to explore a film band for tape by punching from the back to the front and ventilating all the secrets of the assembly, while the (numeric) CDs today do not allow anything but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
With high-speed trains, you drive from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane including the change.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology come back on car and horse.
A last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
Currently, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Practises His Financial Promises
One year after the Treaty of Copenhagen, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-resolution financial promises (also called "fast-start" or pre-financing) implemented by the developing countries.
And already the rough French cleanings are uncovered.
The Treaty of Copenhagen obliges the developing countries to provide 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
On the occasion of the opening of the COP16, the EU has drawn all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start finances: detailed action report of its Member States, press conference, large side events, brochure distribution.
Operation transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its actual value: the developing countries and civil society like to see all developed countries doing the same at the same precision level.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, leading to the right way to pay respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional" in accordance with the Treaty of Copenhagen to ensure that additional efforts have been made without the disadvantage of public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission proposed harmonization, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today everybody chooses the guided value he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen itself as a guiding value for those of 2009: the international financing will be maintained, and it will provide 150 million for over three years in the framework of the financing of "fast-start".
Other countries have chosen similar target values, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development aid.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no target values for the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
Concretely, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or decreased) - France suggests its commitment to "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule on this, and everybody chooses his calculator mode.
Some, such as France, are € 1 loaned as equivalent with € 1 donated.
Obviously this is only difficult to accept: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission reduction projects based on the most effective technology), it is deceptive to present the euro as an equivalent to a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the country of capital is to be considered as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by taking up loans of 91.5% (EUR 389.8 million) and spending €8.5%) 36.1 million - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) carry out their commitments 100% with donations.
In other words, if the majority of the European Union spends 1€ to meet its obligations, France just gives 10 cents and understands a comparable use.
Beautiful hocuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double dizziness: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial use.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (if it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the contracts) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other Member States continue to donate if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing is only a small question at relatively short time compared to the overall debate on the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn his lesson from premature financing this first year.
France could first announce a change in its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and balanced justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could bring forward discussions on the issue of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed topic): the question of "predictability" or the type of booking of its loans is not escaped.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive with regard to disputes as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new environmental minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about the fast start of France and its vision of "predictability" and the use of loans would naturally raise the international basis of confidence, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes various chemicals over the day 81, so a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "has not reflected statistically significant value due to the small number of samples analysed, but represents illustration characteristics of the treated problematic," had usually purchased between July and September the four foods consumed from an approximately ten-year-old to the meals plus an intermediate meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water a day - have been investigated as well as nasheries of laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is defeating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 potentially or likely cancer-regulating and five classified as safe carciogens, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disturbance factor, according to studies from several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded in the nearly total of cases, this survey is very well deprived that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to cancer-provoking substances or substances with endocrine disturbance factor is exciting," the Association notes.
At breakfast alone, the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially cancer-provoking residues and three proven safely carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as an intermediate meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including during lunch, where the study has identified traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hack steak, the tuna fish from the bush, even the baguette and the gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were spoiled.
In the pipe water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloride.
During dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined chemical residues was the most "rich" and even the plastic sheets used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "damaging cocktail" for the consumer is "likely underestimated", says the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts" (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilization diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) referred to the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
