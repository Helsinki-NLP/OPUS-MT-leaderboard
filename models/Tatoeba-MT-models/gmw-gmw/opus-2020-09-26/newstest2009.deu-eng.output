The Prague Stock Exchange crashes into the Minus.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
The transactions with the shares of ČEZ reached almost half of the normal daily business.
At the beginning of the Tuesday businesses, the Prague Stock Exchange joined the breakthrough of Monday when it dropped by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the breakdown at Wall Street was.
Also in the Czech Republic, the market reacts to the outcome of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which it refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Case of shares in Asia
A dramatic case experienced the shares of the stock exchanges in Asia on Tuesday, although the indices could compensate for some of the losses over the day.
The index of the Hang Seng Stock Exchange in Hong Kong lost almost four percentage points during the business day, but was later able to wage some of the losses, thus reducing to about 2.5 percent.
The index Hang Seng China Enterprises, who observed the movement of Chinese shares in the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
The shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan dropped by 3.6 percent after the index there.
"The timing for the US rescue action is uncertain and will influence financial markets worldwide," says the head of the Monetary Authority in Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong decides, although it belongs to China, its monetary policy itself, irrespective of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates in Hong Kong are moving at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, the American legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and adopt the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise it would be dreadful that other countries would also be affected by the breakdown.
A bloodbad of American shares
On Monday, the American Representative House rejected the plan for financial support for which up to 700 billion dollars (now 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush's view is that the plan would regulate the fundamental causes for the financial crisis and thus help to stabilize the entire economy.
The American shares experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and the most important stock indices recorded the largest breakdown in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent, a similar break in 1987 he had recently noticed.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little evidence that the draft would not pass in the House of MEPs, the index experienced a free case.
Congress makes concessions: US government is allowed to pump 700 billion dollars into the banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement on financial assistance for the American financial system.
It is to be voted on this at the beginning of next week.
The American legislators reached a breakthrough in discussions about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance to the American financial system of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory yet.
The delegates have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated on Monday at the American Congress.
On Sunday, this was said by the President of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services Barney Frank of the Agency Reuters.
According to the Senate, different information could probably be agreed on the plan at the earliest Wednesday.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first important psychological factor in relevance of financial markets.
Afterwards, however, there is a "revelation" due to the complicated mechanisms, as could help markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views as to how a package should look for the stabilisation of the market," said the Bloomberg Agency to the Nancy Pelosi democrat.
According to your words, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met to Sunday with the American Minister of Finance Henry Paulson to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unrecurred mortgage assets from financial companies that are falling into serious losses and threatening the stability of the entire system.
"We are at the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
You have to continue the health plan, but I think we're at the target," says Paulson.
A signal for Asia businesses
The global financial crisis also strikes clearly in the stock markets which are falling strongly.
According to the words of the democratic senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators were endeavored to reach a final agreement before Sunday at the Congress.
In fact, we want to calm down the investors before businesses on the Asian financial markets that are in the first time zone, where a decision of the Congress could affect the transactions on Monday.
But it is not yet quite clear when the American Congress's two chambers will vote on the law, but there is also uncertainty whether the negotiations could not fail on a problem in the last minute.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the next few days.
However, the law will experience some changes.
The total amount intended for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion should be made as soon as possible, as President George Bush asked.
However, the Congress can block the spending of the rest of the money if it feels that the program does not perform its function, with another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush is making progress in negotiations positive
Although the President has a veto right in this decision, the Congress may vote against its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme has remained, which was based on obtaining finances for the purchase of poor mortgage papers whose value has fallen, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We've worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, then the Senate on Monday", says the Republican Senator Judd Grengg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was satisfied with the progress of Saturday and "estimated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Banking Committee of the Senate of Christopher Dodd, the executive entrepreneur, said that the legislators had agreed on a responsibility for the money programme, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the conclusion of favours and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law should also limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the societies involved in the programme and set up a committee to be supervised by the Fund.
This is to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it and have achieved a great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," says Paulson.
The plan is also expected to help home owners who have problems with repayment of their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates for mortgages that it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to retain their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea after the main economy of Patria Finance David Marek, but the implementation will be very difficult.
"And because you don't know through which mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are purchased.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves," said Marek to the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is adopted now or at the beginning of next week, Marek's view is not decisive.
"It is much more important that the congress delegates agree to support the plan and that they adopt it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on adoption is the most important at this moment," Marek stressed.
Dual on knife cutting: MP3 players against phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every cell phone MP3 files can play, no MP3 player can still call.
That's why it looks so, of course, that it's better to buy only one phone.
Despite everything, there are enough reasons for putting a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the requirements of the future owner.
Surely you can hardly buy a great expensive record player at home to listen to the latest album of Maxim Turbulenc.
Once, such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with Art Rock, Jazz or Blues in the shelf, you probably dream of one such.
This is also the case with the music on travels, i.e. with compressed music, simplified - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For one thing, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, but a pink floyd fan is probably hard to power headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for each.
The selection is widely incorporated.
The lifetime of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do doesn't even create an endless way.
No modern device can be used as universally as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the telephone and the simulation, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, once a worse photo apparatus and may also navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can grill and not photograph a TV.
However, the universality of mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy-fressers.
Only a few phones can play music longer than ten-twelf hours, mostly it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the easiest) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, with cheap phones you should expect that they can't play more than a few hours of music.
Then, if you call occasionally, you prefer to buy a charging device for the office for safety - that is also true for more expensive devices.
With MP3 players you will not have this problem, even the less good keep out at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation with one time loading.
Another problem is if you want to play the music on your phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB port, and not any mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can play the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers will complete without a reduction with the tiny memory cards used in phones.
For players you don't need any special software until exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device via USB port with music from your PC.
Most mobile phones and players themselves have a music library, arranged by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the user rating.
Some devices only form the tree structure of the address directory, similar to the Windows Explorer, some can both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should examine the performance of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound, and of course also the comfort of your use.
If music is especially for you and you only listen to it every day shortly, for example, in the tram, then any cell phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What really can almost every cell phone.
You don't have to control the music formats that a cell phone or player can process.
MP3 creates all, and the most music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
AAC is less common (a format that uses Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also enable the purchase of music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can purchase a song or album.
This service can be a striking argument for why a music phone should be applied.
Unfortunately, the offer of the provider is bad and mostly limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this type of sale of music (see it via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
The cell phone is most of them wearing.
If you want to listen to something, grab after the phone in the jacket bag, while the player is forgotten at home.
However, it is important whether you are carrying headphones or at least a wireless voltage device.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every cell phone, but only the least MP3 player.
The most likely advantage of the music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest costs usually less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent Walkman.
The greatest handmade will be for most that no normal headphones are present.
The best and technically mature phones with a 3.5mm opening for normal headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
In turn, the advantage of the players lies in light operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really use everyone.
A minimum of functions that are similar to the previously normal tape recorder or, for example, the record player is obvious.
There is no threat to conflict in the form of an unfamiliarly employed mobile Internet and a horrendous invoice for data transfers.
Which device you should now grab
The cheapest phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) also usually have a slot for exchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD etc.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But respect.
Base models usually support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8-GB memory cards.
If you already have a phone and want to buy another cheap MP3 player, then grab Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Irier.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) you will not have to place more than 1100 crowns on the table.
Being among the more demanding listeners, prefer to take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some of Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent control buttons for MP3, and the control comfort comes to that of one single MP3 player.
The most wide is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the single MP3 players sold.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) provide MP3 players from the above manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech suppliers offer practically all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces classical at lower prices.
Maybe this one won't wait for a long time.
The fact that the Czech mobile providers are one of the most expensive in Europe at all, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
This also confirmed the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of roaming fees regulation, a paradoxical situation is likely - for some customers from Czech mobile phone providers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradox, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile providers, on the other hand, like to shun the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
The Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who had often said in the past that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is likely that a classic provider with its own network has no extraordinarily many chances (likely, it would not even find frequencies).
But there is another way - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers to the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, which the classic mobile providers had to react.
Before entering such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile, there were similar votes on the UK market as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don't have to look for examples long.
In February we reported about the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and thus ascend to the five largest supplier of the country.
The financial group Penta, which has U:fon in the Czech Republic, is behind mobilisation.
The advantage of virtual providers is that one can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to work effectively, virtual providers need much less customers than a classic provider.
They do not need relatively high costs for the construction, operation and entertainment of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers are usually elected as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilizing in Poland shows, it can also be a very good chess to put on a non-clinical target group.
This provider is specifically addressed to men.
"Real guys choose mobiles - the provider that they like and who they can trust," said David Seibert, CEO of the Mobile Entertainment Company, the operator company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a concept similar to that in Poland could take foot in the Czech Republic.
The press speaker of Vodafone Miroslav Čepický also doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfactory from the point of view of the service offer."
In the Czech Republic, the mobile phone providers think
But it is almost sure that if a virtual mobile provider conquers Czech Republic, this will not be mobilizing.
"We are talking about an expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not particularly hopeful.
It will rather be a market entry of mobilking in other countries of our region," says a telephone call for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press speaker of the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile service providers in the Czech Republic are not particularly generous to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do all they can to make no potential competitor.
Their interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider has been showing the Group GTS Novera for a long time, which wants to take another step to become a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of company customers.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed network, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the earlier, the better.
About this possibility we have negotiated repeatedly with all Czech mobile providers.
With some of them we have already been able to achieve negotiation progress," says the press speaker of the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
Not official information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
But so far this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
" At this moment we do not assume that there is room for a full-quality virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specificities compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has addressed us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršeň in his statement on Mobil.cz Vlastimil from the Press Department of Telefónica O2.
Other suppliers also point to the specific nature of the Czech market.
The press speaker of T-Mobile Martina Kemrová adds in rare terms to O2's statement: "We have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project on which we could continue to build."
And she adds: "A virtual provider will hardly appear in the T-Mobile network until the end of the year.
At this moment we should already have a specific offer to be able to think so shortly."
Vodafone focuses more on fulfilling the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says: "We are open for negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure.
This is exactly what we consider best from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is looking for a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile Internet."
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of the mobile providers is easy to understand, another provider called more competition, this would reduce prices and thus lead to a decrease in profits.
So why should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
That, when it comes to something, the providers can move on a stake, the long way back and forth also demonstrates the origin of U:fon.
The most likely pressure towards ČTÚ came from society T-Mobile when U:fon came to the market.
This also demonstrates the publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now, U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The competition in the mobile market has recently also been strengthened by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile telephone provider.
Taking into account the character of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is evident that a new player would put high requirements on the market itself and above all its services."
However, in view of this approach the mobile provider is surprised by the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities.
This is not just the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unfortunately, in Czech, is not the competence of the United Kingdom and other highly developed states to intervene in economic competition.
It has exclusively the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, this was a very typical attitude to this whole problem.
"The market entry of a virtual mobile provider would then be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile provider and a virtual provider through the renting of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential stakeholders was probably not sufficiently interesting for classical providers," said Kristián Chalupa, in his answer to our request from the Department of Foreign Relations of the ÚOHS.
Such a formulation would not be surprised by representatives of the providers.
This is more than worrying from an authority representing consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
In particular, if Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the abroad where virtual providers work very normal, it is observed that their market entry has contributed to a price reduction in mobile phone services."
However, the pressure on the proper functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
Really shocking is the almost already touching agreement of the three mobile providers, resulting from their reactions.
The question whether it really is just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same petrol price at the tank stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a hard competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs of action against competition in this matter, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
No one of the suppliers has a dominant market position, so he does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for his market action.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile market for virtual providers are probably also missing by the regulatory authority for telecommunications," said Chalupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, developed by the ČTÚ, after which telecommunications from the point of view of economic competition is a single market.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile providers have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different viewpoint - for the entry into the market of a virtual provider, the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile provider - logically - has the monopoly for its network.
This means that he necessarily takes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you are not involved in this argument, it should be at least a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile network providers are acting dramatically similar.
In this context, complaints of a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) demonstrate that they are very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The deviation of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a rather common trick in the telecommunications services with which the ÚOHS dismisses from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the new telecommunications law, recently adopted, has failed to enforce the expansion of the ČTÚ competences in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must only know all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay if no one looks at it.
The functioning of any pseudo-virtual provider, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unobserved.
It is companies who spend their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Usually, it is companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only come to the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic company expertise, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he will then receive special prize offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar sales.
"If there are cases that you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual conditions with which we will then deal with, which can lead to an end to cooperation with the corresponding society," Martina Kemrová answered on our question about this problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not happen with the controllers of the mobile phone providers.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, it can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such action.
The activities of these companies do not lead to neglecting profits, while they are not affected by the actual official marketing, in contrast to the actual virtual providers.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite all, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card does not run on their name in their phone, so they cannot have full value over it as the normal customers of the mobile phone providers."
This alone, however, would at least have to happen to the ČTÚ.
A further question for the ÚOHS is also open.
The mobile providers close their eyes before such a procedure, why are they locking themselves against a virtual provider?
It is added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to identify such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of providers, they do not know of it and their terms and conditions would forbid it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been stressed several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought a significant price reduction in the various services.
In this context, practically in all countries where virtual providers have developed, classical providers are trying to prevent their origin practically more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - a market too small, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, these moments were just incorporated by the regulatory bodies, which were not trying to preserve the interests of the mobile providers but those of their customers.
Be it by formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and further followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing up the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experiences, we cannot discern the impression that ignorance in the competences in these cases is more than beneficial.
But we don't throw the flinth into the grain.
When the background information is accorded and soon a virtual provider appears, the Czech mobile market may move again soon.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile provider, the ÚOHS will not remain inactive when it comes to rejecting other stakeholders (discriminating).
And the Czechs will finally not call more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymne has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the National Hemisphere Where is my homeland at the day of the Czech state in a festival hour.
The hymne was replayed by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female sologesang, in choir and in an instrumental version.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka took over the vocals.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech National Song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told the Czech radio that he had selected singers with young, representative voices that are markant and popular for the solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to keep a clear dictation with both and then with the choir, so that you can understand the text well, so that there is a match," says the conductor.
The Czech National Hemisphere will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song KDE domov můj first arrived in 1834 on the stage of the standing theatre in the original Czech piece of Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from František Škroup.
It became popular, and people accepted it spontaneously.
After the origin of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first strophe of the song became an organic part of the National Hemisphere.
One of the seven national symbols remained after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" hymn sound?
On Wednesday, the Prague transport companies also transport a chip for the first time
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will enter the history of the Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers enter a subway, tram or bus that carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can now buy about a hundred thousand people who have the chip card opencard.
The passengers can buy a 30-day, 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from January 1, 2009) and simultaneously play it on their chip card in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nadraží Holešovice, Anděl, Rozty, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The Coupons have been available on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long snakes for their paper tickets.
They buy the coupon via the Internet, which is recorded on the opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"In these places, travellers also have a switch with trained staff who advises interested parties on the internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," says the speaker of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons can also be played on the opencard on self-control machines, which are fitted in some metro metro-vestibules.
What do such automates look like?
They are red, remember drivers, the passengers may have already noticed in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there are five of them in the city, but it should be eighty until the end of the year," adds Opatrný.
The coupon controls an automated machine instead of the driver
The operation of the automatics that will work from tomorrow is easy.
You only have to introduce the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays itself.
The electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital but also in the vicinity of tomorrow.
So in the suburbs and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the towns of the region of Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In the trains that belong to Prague's integrated traffic, the train managers have readers with which they can check the validity of Coupons according to time and zone," Philipp Drápal of the Ropid organisation explains the driver's control. This organisation sets out the schedules for the Prague transport operations.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout with the driver.
When entering, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the opencard must be placed at a marked place on the side of the cab.
The driver thus controls the validity of the coupons recorded.
"If a passenger checks the validity of the coupons recorded, nothing is easier than to ask the driver for this information," says Drápal.
A passenger who does not drive with suburb buses and no longer knows when the coupon ends, can again go to the self-control machines where the coupons are recorded on the map.
Here the information on the validity of its documents will be displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a people's decision from the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the division of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is reflected in a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we would like to live under the umbrella of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans have turned to the US presidents.
This is reflected in, among other things, by a letter that has remained in a private archive, which is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian scientific library today.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudengaus" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to the Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure that the American units are not entering as oppressors and enemies of German territory, but as a liberator," says a letter signed with the words "People who are on the heart of the Sudeten's fate."
Since the connection to the Czechoslovakia makes the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - suspect that it would expect brutality, lack of consideration, ununderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for now and forever.
"We can't believe that without regard to the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants of this area, you have spoken to a foreign state for us who is trying to suppress and eliminate minorities and has nothing but contributed to the victory of the Allies," read the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is supposedly the fear of vengeances of the "the Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. President doubts about the mentality of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he in the Böhmerwaldgau initiated a people's decision whether the inhabitants would become part of the USA or would live under the protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today's knowledge of post-war history, he believes that some contemporary witnesses have a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to know at least that they would be negotiated about their deportation from the Republic, only a few of them had such a possibility at all.
Some waited for the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate a kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others believed they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
It also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was used in the war as a Budwise German at the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and was brought him to a war prison camp to Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would pass them," says Chalupa.
No one of the German prisoners who had lived before the war in Czechoslovakia believed that he would be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Beneš Decree.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotions-charged campaign is directed to drivers
The most expensive action for safety on the streets in Czech history.
Similarly, the emotions-charged media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday could be characterized.
The Authority of Minister Aleš ůebíček promises to take riders away from dangerous behaviour behind the steering wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to take riders away from too faster driving and alcohol at the tax.
And they also remember attracting before riding.
The campaign wants to talk to young drivers, motorcycle drivers, pedestrians, and not least professional drivers.
And what is shown in the spots?
In particular, stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign also testifies to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "think not" are in uppercase letters on a mark sign.
And in a blood laughter, the word is "pay."
This means that you can pay a moment of inconsideration with your own life.
The spots will be "shocking" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where normal images can be seen with drastic recordings of accident victims.
It is promised that the number of accidents and the number of traffic deaths are dropping on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the Agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and squirrel for the drivers
"The motto of sugar bread and sweat is valid for the drivers.
Sugar bread means that, for example, they save time when driving with red.
The sweater is the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," says the transport psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And therefore information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, it is less effective that boards that remind the drivers of a danger.
"If you have a static table that warns against a danger, it will probably flow with the surroundings soon, and the drivers will no longer perceive them," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
The president of the provisional Israeli government of Ehud Olmert has spoken for the return of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, Ostjerusalem and Golan, if one could close peace with Palestine and Syria in exchange for it.
He stressed this in an interview printed on Monday by the daily newspaper Jediot Achronot.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," said Olmert to the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we will have to depart to the Palestinians a similar high percentage (Israelian Territories) because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He admitted that a possible return would also include Ostjerusalem.
"The one who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to refrain from a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in response to two attacks in the city in July, where several people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the Prime Minister's words, it will be necessary to find a "Special Solution for the Temple Bers and Holy and Historical Places" located on the Old Town Territory.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he continued.
Detraction from the Golan heights
Olmert spoke of a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan heights, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to close peace with Syria alone on the basis of a deduction from the Golan Heights," confirmed Olmert.
"The Syrians are all too well aware of what they need to refrain from getting back the Golan heights.
They will have to refrain from their present relationship with Iran; they will have to refrain from their relationship with the (shiite) Hisbollah movement; they will have to refrain from the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (shiite) Hamas movement, the al-Khaida terrorist network and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister conceived.
Questions about the accident: Are Stewards in the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a remote bus, it is not allowed to walk around
In connection with the tragic accident of a company Student Agency bus near the Italian Padua, the question is whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk on and off the bus during the journey.
"If we want to comply strictly and formally with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road transport," says the speaker of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, at which last week a two and twenty-year-old Stewardess died, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the bus.
At this moment, the young woman sat at all calamity next to the driver, on the least secure place in the car, although she had two more places available.
But a bus can also have an accident at the moment, or brake sharply, in which the Steward spends coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is equipped with standing places after the vehicle letter.
If this is not planned in the bus, travellers must sit.
The distance buses of Student Agency have no standing places; what the director of the company, Radim Jančura, confirmed against Aktuálně.cz.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry, and this has not first agreed to the movement of travellers.
Later, this has been withdrawn, and we have reached a consensus that allows travelers to go to the toilet during the journey when they have their seats," he informed his position.
The law does not know Steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is no legislation which prohibits the transporter from providing services.
The law on road transport only knows the term vehicle companion, but its rights and obligations do not define it," the spokesman of Hanzelka Ministry clearly adds.
On the other hand, the director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, believes that the law deals with this problem.
"It is important whether the bus in the product permit also has standing places.
That's all," he stresses.
Buses are subdivided into city buses where there are standing pitches and the maximum speed is limited, close buses with standing pitches and a higher allowed speed and distance buses without standing pitches with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with safety arches.
As in the airplane, the expert says
The BESIP company for transport safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of Stewards on board a bus.
"In the case of a liquid ride, not many dangers threaten, the situation is comparable to the service on board a plane.
Here too is not certain when turbulences come, and the stewardess can push its head."
"If, however, a bus brakes sharply, then, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or in a tram.
The safety of Stewards must clarify the transporter through internal regulations," he says and also believes that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to delete the services
Student Agency offers Stewards services as the only bus company.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The Director does not consider his profession as risk-effective even after the accident.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the profession of the Steward is risky, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can receive travellers on board.
That would also reduce the cost," he says.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of Stewards in his bus. However, his company operates only a fraction of lines compared with Student Agency.
"We don't have a steward dinner, but we've been fighting from the beginning.
Earlier or later, this ends with any fatal accident," he had not expressed quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
In the event of an accident of a line bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had been unhappy, who had worked for society for two years.
The Slovenian truck was probably bent off the stand strip without blinking and had locked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right advantage with the truck.
Jančura argued that the two seats had been sold for the Stewards.
"These places cannot be reserved on remote connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With a compensation for the young woman's family, the Agency will not wait for the judicial judgment, but it will also expect financial compensation from the debtor.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of Stewards on board a bus could bring a legal arrangement where a thirty-third expert team of the Ministry of Transport already works over a year.
"This has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Also, buses are not necessarily on the agenda, rather the pointing system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones on the journey," said Prof. Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of Stewards to be a major threat to the safety of travellers," said Hanzelka, with the control of the safety of buses in the competence of police and labour protection authorities.
Düsseldorf's hopes rest on Frankfurt
In the letter of the WestLB board to the staff of the house, there is no lack of great words.
A merging of units of the Düsseldorf Monetary Institute with the Frankfurt Deka Bank could create "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen financial group", says the letter known on Monday.
The WestLB introduced a "competence block" with sustainable yield power into such a business.
And at all, such a connection could be the decisive incentive to further alliances in the national banking sector.
This is how it is read when a board wants to demonstrate actionability in difficult times.
Because WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only by the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervisory Control, which the North Rhine-Westphalia Government has recently made clear that the time has come to find a future solution.
However, the WestLB has been talking about a link between the Deka Bank, the savings bank customers know because of their investment funds, and the WestLB has been talking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank-Chef Franz Waas made known during the presentation of half-year numbers at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a national bank, such as the Helaba or the WestLB, he doesn't see any sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is carried half of the national banks and the Sparkassen associations, has commissioned the Board to conduct discussions with the WestLB on joint business activities.
This could involve the capital market business or parts of it.
The discussions have, of course, just started, as it is at the financial yard.
The Deka Bank, which is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt Finance Station with its 3000 employees, is not the first time talking about consolidation in the Sparkassen sector.
In 2003 it looked like the Deka Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba for a moment.
However, there was nothing from this three-party.
The Hessian state government had barely become public, against a participation of Helaba.
Also the other two houses did not find each other.
Instead, the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, there have repeatedly been thought games about a connection of the Deka bank with national banks.
However, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Management of Helaba, had recently spoken against plan games on a meeting with his house.
However, regardless of this, it seems that a collapse of the different houses of the public-law sector is in need.
After the country's election in Bavaria is now over, the first one could approach a link of the BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily a good news for the Helaba.
If the pressure rises to further mergers, she will gradually go out to the partners for this.
In the south, she would only be more junior partners, although it has endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen and Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, who is involved with 85 percent in Helaba, pushed a rifle at the beginning of the year.
In any case, stay the North LB.
Such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit.
In June, Merl, the decisive question with which business model to ensure the future ability of the national banks, had not been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
At the end, there could also be a abolition of the West LB, but it is not self-demanded there.
In the letter of the board there, it is also mentioned that it is definitely a "total solution" for the house.
How this can be brought under a hat with the deka bank when it comes to joining individual units will be shown.
The second week is known as the "Italian Weekend"
For Elena it's the first, for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the emperor brand, stands a massively built bärtiger and proves the about 200 October festive travelers, which deep tones can produce its throat.
Elena only gives Luca a cushion, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus park next to the Puorta Nuova Train Station, starts four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, in a bus traveling exclusively Brazilian.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans already sing next to their flag, they have celebrated already in the night.
And so loud, Marco Guarda says that this is nothing for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelzimitate food and a glass with broad silver irons, belongs to the buses.
For five years they have gone to the October festival, three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 22.30.
Surnight would only mean unnecessary spices, says Marco.
75 Euro costs the ride, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Bier, brided faithfully the Bavarian purity offer, health insurance and the German-speaking travel guide - Marco has visited a language course in Frankfurt - including.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the car street towards "Brennero".
There's no beer yet.
Quickly it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
In Brixen and in Holzkirchen, several other buses with Italian signs on the motorway 8 will be held again shortly before Munich.
Finally, when Marco's group arrives in early early early on the parking area near the Theresienwiese, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First, put the yellow chicken on.
On it is left "Oktoberfest", in Fraktur, the internet address of Marco's travel office: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly, "When the doors go up to the beer tent, it's going!", Marco calls in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the squares in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow walls on the same benches, distribute in the room!"
The measure, Marco brilliants, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget drinking money.
"The security officers show that we act well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!"
Thirdly, "Today night, half eleven again here!" Did you understand?
And we're going to the Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds to the trees, to signs and even to the electoral poster of a large Bavarian folk party.
You want to be woven for the retreat.
It is the second meadow, known as the "Italian Weekend".
There are no precise figures about the number; the word is of 50 000 who are going across the Alps and fall into the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors should be extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich Police is strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which leads a national statistics in which Italians (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (approximately 80) first place with about 200 medical supplies.
The farmhouse is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless nights for creditors of the Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, emphasised Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and still inflicts that the German banking sector is not spared from the crises of the developments.
Because it has now arrived in the weekend.
The Münchner Real Estate (HRE) noted in Dax receives a billion credit from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulences on the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit aids amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay the part that it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public-law banks.
Background are losses in the daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has borrowed money, the state financer had refined extremely short-term - which is no longer possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserve of cash was reduced by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate had slightly dropped from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared to the previous year period, revenues from bonds and certain securities as well as the dissolution of deposits in credit transactions fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only due to higher revenues from reimbursements of downstream reimbursement costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax regulation and from the provision of businesses for group companies, the profit rate had still decreased moderately at around 16 percent.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state funder had first speculated himself with commercial real estate credits, which were then divided into the Aareal Bank.
Because the classic state funding was too low, the Depfa had then engaged more in infrastructure projects and the financing of Community projects of private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
On the value of the daughter, the Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciations that will have a "real material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite undetermined.
The fact is that the dividend was deleted.
It had already been reduced by two thirds for 2007.
The Hypo Real Estate has been an important state and infrastructure fund since the Depfa acquisition.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the loans under the banks were reversed largely, as the banks listened to their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs the short-term refinancing appropriations for a part - around 50 billion euros - of the Depfa credit portfolio each year.
According to the notification of the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered with the loan at a foreseeable time and the company is "shielded from the influence of the currently largely incapable international money markets".
From other sources, it can be heard that, thanks to the funds, the refinancing was secured by the end of 2009.
The HRE Chairman Georg Funke stated, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets at foreseeable time.
The Bundesbank and the Federal Financial Service Supervisory Institute (BaFin) assume that the market ability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This is hoped for shareholders and creditors of the Bank.
But in view of the dynamism and inconvenience of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that the financing does not have to be fully used.
But the opposite is not to be cut out.
After the hearing after the bank was still ahead of insolvency on the late Sunday evening, at least provisional rescue will not be able to calm the minds.
The stock rate breaks by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
In contrast, the bond courses are quite good.
If the priority debts are scarcely moving, the courses of subordination bonds give a clearer impairment.
In particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the deadlines beyond 2009 are affected.
If Hypo-Real-Estate bonds were formerly a speculative investment alternative, their value should be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharpening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only taken over the Depfa.
As long as the notes banks, governments and less attacked business banks are ready to support the system, as long as a long-term eradication of pensions can be excluded.
But it happens what hardly anyone is currently hoping to wage - that the financial crisis will be overwhelmed in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reporting of the sub-governmental nature, the probability of security has only become just a legitimate hope at present.
In particular, long-term believers should make some sleepless nights with the decision whether they should separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can in any case use a loss presentation for future tax payments on price gains in later years.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bento box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 is to introduce himself on the first school day at the Tachibana High School, the girls begin to kicher: The Germans are totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
I had Bammel before school.
I live on the edge of Tokios towards Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, luckyly I didn't go.
The start of the teaching appears not as strictly defined at the Tachibana as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The pupils start a short meeting round with the teacher, the 'home room' at 8:00 a.m.
But before the teaching began, I was on the turn to imagine.
I'm not the guy who likes to speak before people, even before a class of 40 students.
Because I had no school uniform, I attracted an old skirt of my guest mother, including bluse, blue knees and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the pult and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, come from Germany and have birthday in a week.
At the moment, I was very happy that I had already started learning the language well two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all chopped, chickened and wake and I have heard the word "Kavaii".
I already knew that from my mangas.
It belongs to the survival-important vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'delicious, sweet'.
Then I've been sneaking to my place quickly.
The girl next to me smelled quite wide, she found it an honour that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the  Gong sounded, I was really surprised.
Everyone talked and chicked and asked me holes in the abdomen - it is really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, all of them then packed out their bentos.
My mom had made me a lunch box like that - that's something different from the old German breakbread.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofumantel.
Most of the time I don't have a blister, what I eat right here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It's true that everything's really delicious.
Well, up to the salty plums maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a self-prepared Bento to a boy, which is then particularly artificially constructing it - in the hope of getting to know the boy at the breaking neck.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm just excited if I can watch this here too.
'Why, Japan?', my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school for a year in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because I'm fascinated."
Finally, I have been reading the most popular mangas for years.
And so that I better understand the comics and culture in it, I also started to learn a little Japanese at some point.
So for me it was quite clear that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a fable for tradition, morals and customs.
And on these one's great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of latest technologies and trends - on the other hand it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have not felt lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen."
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a jacket fleeing in danger means that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientific Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Just how could you check if they feel the same if they act like us?
The Internet magazine " Edge" has published contributions from famous scientists for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other consciousness conditions without that I or anyone else could prove this so far where we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can hope at least because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and tackle issues of sensation or generally consciousness, we enter unsatisfactory terrain, because the hardware does not agree.
When a rat gets in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it is dead, fleeing, or attacking.
People act similarly, which some scientists conclude on a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the almost always associated with human consciousness circuits include the side prefrontal cortex (because of its participation in the short-term memory and in the execution/control functions).
This wide region is much higher in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely missing in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness, which depend on prefrontal Cortex, including the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to assume that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic nature is likely to be in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it often says that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, one could exclude animals.
But even though consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be obtained, is likely very different from most of our consciousness conditions.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine how consciousness may look in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it cannot measure or, because of the special hardware, can be analysed on the basis of our own experience, his research is facing us with major problems.
Most of my statements refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be more accessible scientifically.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But in this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick pursued, they are rather devoted to the neural correlate of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also highlights the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the condition of visualization.
What is the result of the feelings?
I remind them that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of his own activity conscious brains.
So what we call "fright" is the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the brain-localised defense system (or their consequences, such as physical reactions) demonstrates memory.
In this regard, feelings are closely tied to the Cortex regions that characterize primates and especially human beings.
Associated with the linguistic nature, we have fine dispositions of sensation, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of the words and grammars, in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
By contrast, Antonio Damasio thinks that feelings of primitive activities in the body sensitivity regions of the Cortex and the brain tribe are similar to Jaak Pankseep, but that is more focused on the brain's strain.
Since this network has not changed very much during human evolution, it could well be involved in genus-transparent sensations.
I can't contradict this theoretically, but I think it is unaffirmed.
Pankseep argues what appears to be in the case of rats and people such as fear, probably also in both cases: How, however, can one check whether rats and humans feel the same if they act similarly?
Does a jacket flee in danger if she also feels fear?
In my view, mere compatibility of conduct can still prove no equality of experience.
Although the neuronal comparison continues to help: rats and humans have similar brain tribes, but scarves do not even have a brain.
But is the brain strain responsible for feelings?
And even if you could prove this to man, how would you prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even jackets (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove that.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, progress on the neural level is being made in order to measure the same in rats and humans.
As I do not research language and consciousness in rats, or not feelings, I don't know if they exist.
You might think this is short-sighted, but I'd rather go ahead than run constantly against a wall.
I'm just a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Period of Grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of President and Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize EM together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is much to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of the stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts depart afterwards.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages is reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at maximum speed now," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigorij Surkis.
"The UEFA will keep our eyes on us constantly."
A more radical step was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and has been replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had gathered at the request of Minister for Sport Miroslaw Drzewieecki.
It is "the serious danger that the PZPN is unable to act according to the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polish News Agency PAP.
"We have assured Uefa President Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 EM will not suffer."
Several firstligists had been condemned for manipulation alone in the past season, and even the league start had to be postponed in the short term.
Defeat Dennis Quaid blows back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about privates in the interview - and now has anger with the ex: Hollywood-Star Meg Ryan outete her fledged Dennis Quaid as an adult.
He's foaming - and blowing back.
Late rose war at the Ex-Ehe couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors now carry out an unprecedented conflict with each other - in all public.
In an interview with the U.S. magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the failure of marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful for a long time, and that was very painful."
The extent of fraud has only been experienced after divorce.
The occasion for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband seemed clearly: "Incredibly," said the 54-year-old of the "New York Daily News", that "Meg would buy and refine the history of our relationship for a repeated time."
It is also "deplorable" that the common 16-year-old son Jack is again "publicly reminded of the pain and the revolutions that mean divorce for each child."
While Ryan lived alone since the divorce, Quaid was married again and recently became father of Zwilling.
And so close his introductions with the side hib: "My life goes on anyway.
I am happy that I have a wonderful family that's fine."
Prices of tickets and hotels decrease
In the first half of 2008, flights and nights in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even cheaper to up to 50 percent according to a current study.
Flights and nights in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by the travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, found a significant break in the second quarter.
After the prices have risen on the hotel market for years, the nights have already been reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 investigated European cities continued to rise by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were 3,6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend was in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than one year before.
As a cause of this, American Express sees the weak dollar course that led to a "decreasing travel hungry of American tourists".
Also, financial places such as Frankfurt or London are more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
In the first quarter, the trend also showed up in flight prices:
Due to the ceremony, travelers in the economy class had to pay 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel intense long-distance flights even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the economic class air ticket prices decreased by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in the business and first class were considerably lower.
Prices were even more in Germany than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, prices have even halfened on German domestic flights.
On the one hand, the reason for price breakdown is the slowdown in economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the flight market is fragile.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the USA and Europe, has increased competition pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the removal of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that had registered bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 – this was 24 airlines alone in Europe.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a gate and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes table leader.
In Borussia, Luhukay is still not able to find a working elephant.
From Kristoffers Small increase breakdown for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher first came into the game late and failed with a lifter to the Latte.
His message was precisely formulated, she went convincingly over his lips.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second gate", shed Hermann Rieger in the cabinet of the Hamburg Arena.
A lot wasn't loose in the catacombs, the mid-term break was finished and most sat back on their places.
Rieger was nearly three decades physiotherapist of the HSV, he enjoys a higher reputation than some fleeting actor.
And so his request also found hearing in a responsible place.
Assistant Kornelius Jol nicked and lifted up the thumbs.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief trainer Martin Jol.
The command will have been likewise: Here with gate two!
Implementation stayed out.
"There wasn't a good look at all today," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt also wished to be "relaxed".
The 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe the headball hit of Mladen Petric (11.); and the fact that very weak Gladbacher could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summoned.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which proved to be a class prize for their club.
It'll be a birthday without a real party.
"We know that," said Marcell Jansen.
He believes that the table intermediate certificate stands more for the incalculability of the league than for the dominance of its HSV.
The team with their late-binding accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the gatekeeper Petric and Jansen, who were rejected by the FC Bayern - finds it slow, but they can't shine yet.
"We need more flair and more dribblings," asked Jol.
After the vote
There's anxiety about Wall Street.
First news of the failure of the rescue package temporarily broke the Dow Jones around 700 points.
This was the greatest point loss within one day in his history.
Later, the Dow got back.
By 20:30 a.m., the world's most important stock exchange barometer recorded with almost five percent in the minus at 10.579 counters.
The Nasdaq technology market was at more than seven percent in the minus at 1548 points.
The largest loser was at that time in the Dow American Express, which borrowed nearly 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could be added.
The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs gave up by nearly ten percent.
Only a few days ago, large investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
The rescue plan aims to provide funds for the purchase of so-called faul mortgage papers.
However, the sum is not to be paid on a stroke but gradually.
In return, the State should receive stock option certificates from financial companies which could be triggered in the event of appropriate course development in order to reduce the burden on the state cash.
Stock rates in Europe and the USA downwards
The billions of aid to banks in Europe and the USA do not raise the doubts of investors.
The share rate of the German Großbank Hypo Real Estate crashes and breaks down the Dax.
The US index Dow Jones loses despite the planned rescue of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of the Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank have deeply plucked the German share index (Dax).
Despite the rescue action by the Federal Government and private banks, the Münchner Real Finance Fund has temporarily lost three quarters of its value, the Commerzbank gave up by more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly slipped under the psychologically important 6000 points brand and noted with a minus of 3.7 percent at 5.839 points.
Worldwide, the stock markets went into the knee.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US Government’s $700 billion rescue package could not be sufficient to bring back the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10.809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. representative house wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index gave up by 3.2 percent, and the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese guide index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11.743.61 counters after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index slipped by 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, Sensex lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12.595.75 counters.
In the MDax, the shares of Arcandor gave up after announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has drawn the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook were not sold.
Dark matter affects flight from space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has brought advice: Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by-manövers.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein could not be quite right.
Almost 18 years the space probe "Ulysses" flew through the space.
Now, because of soon frozen fuel pipes, you threaten to the cold odd.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion - the swing-by anomaly.
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, where they receive additional swing in the gravity field of a celestial body, such as the earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the sun probe Ulysses.
However, what the researchers have been surprised for years: the airlines do not act 100 percent as they would be expected in accordance with the old-fashioned Gravitation Act.
Rather, there are irregularities in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They baptized him swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction of matter by a crumbling of space, might not be quite correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler from Princeton Institute for Advanced Study still firmly believes that Einstein was not wrong, and attempts to explain the Swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have made up in the universe.
"Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to the earth," he writes.
The space researchers know about the existence of the dark matter only for about ten years.
It is obviously a attraction whose effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
On the other hand, it itself is completely invisible, i.e. it sends and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of the scientists, the dark matter constitutes well one fifth of the whole mass of the universe.
Tourisms kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their kidnappers, the travelled tourists in Egypt should be free again, as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The descendants from Sudan demanded several million euros of solvents.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were supposed to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
Solution bargaining is already supposed to run.
Germans repeatedly went to the visibility of kidnappings.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
This reported the Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabica and Italian media agreed.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release according to reports from the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're just checking her state of health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were well up and in safety, reported the Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are supposed to be on the way to Cairo.
The reasons for a shooting continue to remain unclear before the release of hostages: accordingly, the kidnappers, according to an Egyptian security officer, were ready to terminate the abduction before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," said the official.
It was "only about taking hostages to receive" when suddenly came "this surprise".
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them on Sunday.
The hostages had requested from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money should be handed over by the German wife one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" reported on a German intermediary who delayed the release of hostages because the kidnappers were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo rejected an opinion on the report.
Misuse of the stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The many years of abuse by her stepfather has caused a woman to kill himself, a court was reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, received a six-year prison sentence after he had experienced eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly caught his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle killed himself in her house in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise had bonded her eyes before he performed sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife read divorce in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court found that Mrs Randle, who worked a large part of her time for the National Trust, was persecuted by abuse, which had been added to her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been "emotional dead" since 2006 and "resigned her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is assumed that she killed herself by embroidering herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the stepfather of his daughter who wrote a confession letter that ended: "I used to tie her and connect her eyes."
"I didn't need her sexually.
I feel responsible for her death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "They are an extremely strange fetist and for her sacrifice it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would be ended before the court if it had not done so."
He added: "I take note of the effects of her deed on her daughter over the years, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother.
Otherwise, she would have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman."
Officials responsible for lost data shall be charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who had lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be accused of the "Public Security Act".
The man was detached by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents in one train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed out to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intention.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said, "They would have thought that this would be an internal deal with the Ministry of Defense and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned shall be charged under paragraph 8.1 of the Law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The royal prosecutor recommended that the official be charged by the Metropolitan police for the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Secret Service Committee.
The documents he moved contained classified reviews on Al-Quaida and the capacities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and was brought from his house to a secret place.
Housebuilding companies see B&B costs in mind
British housing companies could be in the house of more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government made 14 billion pounds available to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys 2.6 million customers.
Interests for this loan are paid by all companies who receive money from investors, including 59 construction companies
The Director-General of the Association of Housing Societys (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it was "incompatible" that the companies and their members should pay.
The 14 billion loans will finally be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are cooled.
But the interest gained in the meantime will be charged each year to 700 financial companies who accept deposits.
The Compensation Programme for Financial Services confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions who have acted cautiously ... are now called to take over some of the costs of those institutions who were far less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in relation to the deposits it would hold, and that companies together would have to pay about 18% of the costs.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest rate for the loan will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that companies must acquire 81 million pounds for the first year's interest rates.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Association of Housing Companies, informed the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions who have acted cautiously during the real estate recovery are now called to carry some of the costs of those institutions who were far less careful.
According to the BSA, no society has failed since the existence of the records in 1945.
"We will observe all aspects of this matter over the next weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs."
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and this could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organisations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either by higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
milk becomes five pence per litre expensive
People in Jersey are confronted with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the large market price of his milk by another five Pence per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two Pence increase in February, and comes after studies carried out by a consultative company.
The retailers should decide themselves whether they want to pass the price increase on to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the large market price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh is denied deposit
A court in Bangladesh rejected a warranty request from the former Prime Minister Scheich Hasina, which means that she could be arrested if she returned to the country.
Their defenders said that the Court of Justice refused to have extorted 50 million Taka ($729.700) by a businessman while she was Prime Minister.
The case is one of several swift charges for corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival Khaleda Zia was released against deposit at the beginning of this month.
Scheich Hasina is to return to Bangladesh in the next weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-supported transitional government first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that although their imprisonment was granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear in the context of their release whether it will continue to stay free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers claim that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Scheich Hasina's deposit requests because it says that she must not be granted a deposit, as it is already on a detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will register a legal complaint against the upper court."
Their lawyers claim that they need deposits to return from abroad to the country to prepare for the elections in December.
It is expected that Scheich Hasina will return home after 17 October, said an Awami Party Chairman on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the military-supported transitional government had taken power, but in June she had been released from prison to go abroad for medical treatments.
Both Scheich Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fear for the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In Afghanistan's recent anti-policy initiative, nearly 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence associated with the Taliban, the United Nations.
The United Nations conducted a vaccination programme last week in six provinces.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the promise of the Taliban to not attack or impede thousands of vaccinations.
BskyB loses complaint in the case of ITV
BskyB has lost its complaint against the decision of the Competition Commission to reduce its share in the competitive broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeal Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted the competition and enabled it to influence unfairly the ITV broadcaster.
BskyB acquired his share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed to Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB poses doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to start an investigation.
The Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Communications Office Ofcom have voted against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that he would want to give up his voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. prosecutor affairs
The U.S. General Prosecutor has commissioned a special advisor to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the United States in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, in which the actions of the administrative staff were criticized.
The report criticized the officials of the White House, legislators and former prosecutor-General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by the fears that the lawyers had been dismissed for political reasons.
Specialist Nora Dannehy is about to clarify whether the officials in question have lying to the investigators in order to hinder the justice during the investigation.
Serious announcements including criminal proceedings have not been fully examined or clarified, said General Inspector Glenn Fine in his report.
The calling of a special investigator with the power to force the witnesses to say was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began as the Ministry of Justice in December 2006 nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices.
At that time, the Ministry argued that the prosecutors would be released due to weak work.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, which caused many observers to view the terminations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial persecution of high-ranked republic congress members, while others refused to investigate the accusations of election fraud of the Democrats.
US prosecutors are commissioned to investigate and pursue judicial cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be dismissed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Alberto Gonzales, General Prosecutor of State, has been dismissed because of the dismissal and in the final effect has laid down his office.
A number of officials of the Ministry of Justice have also terminated.
In particular, the report of the General Inspector addressed the role of Gonzales by carrying the "main responsibility" for the releases, "resigning" its leadership role and showing himself "exceptly disinterested" in the process
Other officials, including the former chief adviser of President Bush Karl Rove, were criticized for the lack of cooperation with the investigators.
Meat Loaf's epischer song is to be honored
The Rockstar Meat Loaf is to be honored during the musical award "Q Award" for his epic hymne "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special golden price during the loan next week in London, said that he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the song for Meat Loaf's hit album from 1977.
"Coldplay" leads the nominations for the award of the price this year after it came into the closer selection in four categories.
The editor of the magazine "Q Magazine" Paul Rees said that there were some songs that went beyond such material as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" were certainly one of them.
The song written by Jim Steinman required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that takes almost two minutes.
The song was published in 1979 as a single in the United Kingdom and reached 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" spent about nine years in the charts and sold itself more than 40 million times worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he had collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to an acute boiling head inflammation.
Later, it became known that he had a cyst on his voice band.
Obscure street in town, often forgotten and perhaps soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, only side streets and other surrounding streets, some of which are famous and others are only comfortable.
Nevertheless, it is hard even for experienced taxi drivers and long-term residents to say where there is extra place, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in the East Village and runs from the First Street direction north between Bowery and Second Avenue, without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty gas than after an active road.
There are no road signs either.
It is practically impossible to find it on a standard street plan.
This road still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to replant Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques that are expected in the new buildings.
Among the other worshipers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says that it is fascinated by the short gate just because it is one of the remains of the past of the house block.
However, the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and which is responsible for the road, has no interest in maintaining them.
During a meeting of the Committee on Land Use of the Municipal Council this month, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the purchase of the road by the construction company.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers the road to stay in the hands of the city and asked for a new plan to be presented in the next month, says Susan Stetzer, district responsibilities at the municipal council 3.
"Only little room has remained in the property of the city and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers to repair the road and operate what could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago, the small street re-paved and set up seats, among other things for a café that the company wants to rent room.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was made public for the first time during the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson from Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to possess it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate and make a public meeting point," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman of the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city's desire to sell the street and stressed that the department's task was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared with his colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has preserved some of his historical impression.
Some believe that the road had its name in 1802 when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anybody.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the Punkrockdenkmal, which was closed in 2006, opened to the extra place and the street is certainly known as a scene for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" of Ramones.
The plaster was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones who made the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, lumps and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling extra place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, should continue to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rareness – a practically unchanged splitter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who operates the blog called "Jeremiah's disappearing New York" (subtitled with "The Book of Claims: A bitter nostalgic view of the extinction city"), published part of the conversation of the city history about Extra Place, published in the 1952 magazine "The New Yorker".
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at that time: "Extra Place is a small narrow sackgasse that remains even dark during the day and is marked by rusted metal doors of the warehouses, closed windows and flying weekly newspapers passing by rains."
With a few exceptions, the road has looked just that recently on one night.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that once led to the CBGB, where today is a more expensive clothing business.
Graffiti was on the walls and an empty beer bottle was not far from a fresh bundle of elaborated newspapers on the ground.
Some passers said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished somewhat.
Fields, added that, in his opinion, some people underestimate the irritation of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, humid and horrible.
Discussion on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch" Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, head of scientific staff in Kalifonic Studies and Director of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection."
To address the hispanic electors is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's electoral campaign mentioned that "the probability of afro-American and hisopathic pupils successfully finish the school is lower than white pupils" - what is true.
In order to close this performance distance, Obama's education plan specifically recommends a two-language transitional phase in training for those who first learn English.
The question of Obama is, however, whether his use for the two-language training, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest to reduce the distance of school services.
Take as an example "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of pupils are hispanic and come from families with low income.
More than one third of the pupils, many of whom are only recently in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, amazing 100 percent of the fourth class students passed the state examination in Mathe at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth school year were well rated in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved with other methods than those preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street School focuses on review and exercise, on continuous control of knowledge and a attitude that does not tolerate exceptions.
In addition, the school practices the approach of training in an english-speaking environment. That is exactly the point Obama should observe, according to the school director Linda Mikels.
This approach focuses on the almost exclusive use of the English language in the specialist class.
Ms Mikels, who refused the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico. 12 months later, one would be able to enter the classroom and no longer recognize him.
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share in Latin American and other English students?
The performance of the school would make the answer to this question easier, but the education policy positions within its own party (the national image unions have long been supporting the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for the two-language training make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing to the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the topic by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English".
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your child can be Spanish".
If Obama really wants to close the performance distance, he should carefully take into account educational models that work instead of despising and trivializing them.
The oil price decreases as a result of re-experienced economic concerns
On Monday, the petroleum price has fallen greatly because of the fears that even the American rescue plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy.
The raw oil terminals at the New York trade fair fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per bar in the morning session.
Since last Monday the price has dropped by more than $20.
During the last two weeks, the goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulences at Wall Street and by strong spine storms in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached their peak of $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell this month to almost $90 per barrel to rise again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have been worried again, although congress representatives had announced that they had agreed on a rescue plan that should be the largest in history during the weekend.
This message was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis was still far from completed.
In the first last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government communication on Monday, Citigroup is supposed to buy the bank businesses of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclay's Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place in the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it seems that it was not possible to experience the mood on the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to fall.
The Deutsche Bank's analysts wrote in a communication to investors that the forecasts for the global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates had become extremely uncertain.
We believe that they continue to write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China."
The bank's analysts have corrected down their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the next year, and reduced their forecasts for the price of oil and gas for 2009 by 20%.
Team record by series in the second quarter
Indoor defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything after he had been more often than anyone else in the Jets tricot in the last eight and a half years.
Then on Sunday, he saw the second quarter, in which the Jets transformed a resultless game into a triumph.
"I've never seen anything like that," said Ellis.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when Quarterback Brett Favres Pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-Yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start for a afternoon when her evolving cooperation made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, which once swept out as an outside defender and the other once 10 seconds before the end of the mid-term.
"I haven't been particularly trying," Coles says about the passports that went to Coles.
"He's a superplayer.
Our vote has voted, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles played fishing, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner broke apart.
Outside defender Darrelle Revis took off an unhappy worm and turned it into a 32-year touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and took him off.
Linebacker David Bowens then made a loss of warner.
The last loss of ball, forced at Bowens, was probably the crazyest.
The cardinal had conquered the ball with another 10 seconds in the game when the Jets conquered the ball and Jay Feely changed a 20 yard shot to the 34 to 0 leadership.
These were most of the points that the Jets had ever achieved in a quarter.
When he was asked to describe the madness Erik Mangini replied, the coach of the Jets "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
On the answers both, for the Jets left 21 points in the third quarter without one one, said Mangini: "Glo me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points have been achieved in a short time."
Outspoken breeze strikes his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has again shown why some think him for the best long-term runner ever after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to reach the 42.2 km route in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has improved its previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had reached last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set up his 26th world record in his versatile career, where he has at least reached a world championship title on every route from one kilometer to the marathon, or has set up a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie left the Olympic Marathon in Beijing, because of fear that afterwards might have been exaggerated that air pollution could worsen its asthma problems.
Instead, he registered for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - at sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the destination - Bretselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have switched to long distances, the record time for Marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin in 1998 with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had two weeks ago had cramps in his wade and could therefore not train a week.
Obviously, he was refreshed after break and did not come back in roasted.
"I'm so happy," he said to reporters.
"Everything has walked perfectly.
I've resumed the training a week ago and I still had some concerns today, but at the end I've had a great deal."
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he is excessly orchestraed his races, many world-best marathon stars generally avoid, relying too much on the race leaders, as if it were a race, and world records about the competition.
However, this criticism hardly hurts the size of Gebrselassies as long-distance runners.
Along with four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the route in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had left off.
Some more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie has made his last approach to separate himself from Kwambai, who has arrived as the second in 2:05:36 and thus improved his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi became a third party in 2:07:48.
In women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a significant year by showing the seventh-fast result ever at 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from the UK.
In the last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing, because of problems described as back injury. However, she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She scheduled her way by leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to break out, but after 30 kilometres.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia was second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived as a third in 2:25:01.
The pride and the straps in the lives of the black population, in a city of very special kind
Hidden between the growth of leisure parks in the surroundings of Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic drifts, is a quiet city where pride and complications of Afro-American culture appear.
Eatonville, the first totally black city in the country and the home town of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crockets, 300 brown skins, 300 good swims, more than enough guaves, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it's a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to remember the most famous author of Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city that it describes – and made it a tourist destination by taking it into the Florida travel guide, which was produced by the German writer project at the time of depression – is and remains in many respects a place of very special variety.
Eatonville is as independent, thieved and private as in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little about us that he does not know what is missing."
Even today, in a year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open conversation about racial relationships, many are still sorry to be observed by outsiders.
"We are very concerned about how our history is told," says Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and municipality member of the oldest church of the city.
It must be voted."
Eatonville was defined as the paradox of the triumph and the battle for a long time.
It is a historical example of black movement as well as a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the country average.
On the one hand, it is a burst of literature, and on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes convicted, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south, which has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so rightly, the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as all here call Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world in books that came from heart and were written in Mundart, like "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida travel guide changed the city, which is very close to the route 77, a road leading through the often forgotten centre of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Frech like Oskar, both in real life and in literature, led Hurston readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then addressed more private matters.
"From the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown -wise modern school, with its well-kept gardens and playgrounds that always care for Howard Miller, although he can hardly read and write."
She also mentioned the new widow Dash man and wrote that Lee Glenn "sold drinks of any kind and what-even-immer fits to hourly rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston thus associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with analphabetism, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by all.
"Zora described things as they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls evacuated the Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about the beauty of their girls who were full of sexual imaginations.
She added, "Some people didn't like this."
There is still a reminder of Hurtson as a lively excentric who returned regularly after her family had moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
August Franklin, 77, remembered that when Hurston came to the city brewered, she did this mostly without warning, in a noiseing Chevrolet, smoked and clothed with trousers, in a city that even today imagines something on her venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most people were fascinated, but many despised them.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But "they never stayed too long," he added while swinging in his chair, on a back terrace looking at the lake of Sabelia, where Hurston was likely to be baptized after.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and lost her books.
Together with the majority of the world Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was joined in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived, in an anonymous grave.
In Eatonville there was no big commemorative celebration, no public readings in large style.
"I don't think they understood their contribution in the world or her legacy in the lowest", said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-speed highway through the city to replace the Kennedy Boulevard, the slow two-spure main road of the municipality.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed the highway 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal was submitted when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult phase in his history.
Forced integration, including, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the municipality.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred into the community.
"In this time, a lot of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff on the off-seat people," said Mr. Franklin.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In 1955 Hurston in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel questioned the claim of the Supreme Court of Justice to force integration by referring to his decision in the Brown case against the School Council as "political rather than respecting my race".
People today say that although the removal of racial separation in some respects was positive, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-consciousness of his youths.
"Black children were used to be embraced - I remember - they embraced their teacher in the morning and they embraced his teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and business manager of the non-profit group to protect the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained for so long, she added until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural gap," said Mrs. Nathiri.
However, citizens' rights have contributed to the creation of space for further Zora Neale Hurstons - black authors, actors and artists who overlooked prejudices, as she did, with positive self-consciousness and statements such as: "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker made himself on the way to Hurston's nameless grave and began to fight for the revival of her glory.
Five years later, a highly praised Hurston biography by Robert E. Hemenway was to be found in the book shelves, and again made it part of the American literature canon.
The highway project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of the public.
And this time Hurston's old neighbor saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return to the celebration.
Some years later, the district turned off its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-spure highway built the city, accelerated the whole with a peak speed, aroused real citizens' pride," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd expressed it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the remote road project has contributed to a change in the self-image of the city.
There were more and more trainees, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who went to church since 1993, and locals began to appreciate the past again.
Eatonville was added to the country-wide historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (naturally named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today Eatonville is still a speciality in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlandos City Centre can sometimes feel like a rear gas in summer rain, as small as then when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black today.)
Foreigners looking for the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, approval is necessary in advance and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church, painted by a wise and representing black men in field work - are not to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a courageous, self-conscious teacher with a preference for dark red, still fear that her protected community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time when the Hurston Festival grew, an increased degree of home pride was also born.
In particular, young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, not worse or better and just as proud, creative and diligent, narrative and blended as any other race and race group in America.
It is the sincere love of this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephews, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who intends to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or at the police who might use some help according to him.
And even the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who go through here will think, "Ach, this city is nothing compared to all the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on one Sunday after the church.
"But if you actually stop and look at his history for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, we talk about a fleeting financial lady.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from newspaper stands and the huge television screens at Times Square, they wouldn't notice that they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that over their heads, in the shawls-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedgefound managers who have the monopoly in New York, daily have the worst horror work day since the stock exchange crash in 1929.
The suppliers are still pushing the metallened tea weights along the side of the bourgeois and transporting tablets loaded with Muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latinos still swallow between apartments, how human packing animals loaded with around the 50 bundled T-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod on their shoulders.
Office employees are still waiting for foodstuffs on the burglar climbing on their breakfast ball and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekly day between 16 and 19 o'clock.
It didn't feel like a crisis until I decided to open a new savings account on the basis of all the world's breakdown talks on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had decided to put my duty on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase tribal branches, about 20 people were already standing snake.
Not to the money switches to collect or pay money, but to the customer service switch where stem customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to the purchase house of Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most in front of me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with license", was for the same reason as I was snake.
Contrary to me, however, they had already removed their spares from smaller banks, from places from where they drove, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had deducted money from so-called Thrifts (a little like one building parkasse), cooperative banks and those local savings banks that have only branches in one state and say that they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks have gone quietly and quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with investments of $327 billion, went home in bankruptcy management and as last Friday New Yorkers over weekend, was Wachovia, another bank with savings worth $440 billion, looking for a saving buyer.
In the fear of another collapse, the office and shop staff who stood before me brought her bares to a bank that is considered a safe port, a bank responsible for most rescue purchases at Wall Street.
Very normal New Yorkers have managed to run in the last few weeks.
A woman who telephoned in my Chinese headquarters' supermarket referred with so much intimacy to Lehman Brothers, the Pleite bank and their depleted chairman Dick Fuld, as if she was blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed Concierge of my living block around 50 years, came from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I don't get a risk anymore."
Muslemic graves are injured during the slip of law in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-righted Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian rights of Pertei Vlaam, participate in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17th, 2008 to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is drawn, crossed with a red line.
The police accuses legal extremists of grave burial at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, taking significant profits in the election of the country's parliament on the same weekend.
In the night of Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun were severely damaged by Linz in an action organized according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols like the David Star on some of the graves, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to hide the motive of the extremists driven by the hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way connected with the elections.
A speaker of the local Islamic community said she was "foundly shaken" about the message of grave decay that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan tends to end.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is carried out in Austria after the country slipped to the right in the yesterday parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far right-looking parties received the nearly 30% of the votes, took part in their election struggle for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their electoral claims were criticized by opponents as a foreign enemy.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the votes, was committed to banning headdresses and Burkas and even announced his aversion to foods that are generally associated with Islam.
During his last announcement in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarettes with the argument that these political symbols are of continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election and which say that the extreme rights are the politically strongest block in the country indicate that this new development is based on young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel barrier for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the Glam Rock Star, who has been sentenced to sexual abuse by children, was judicially forbidden to travel to France and Spain.
Judge Glitter laid up a six-month block after informing the controlling authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
The police in Kent was granted last Thursday to impose a foreign travel block after she presented evidence to the judges of Glitter's penalties for the sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, the right name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Office Court in Kent, but was represented by the Corker Binning Lawyer.
EIn spokesman of the Court of Justice reported: "On Thursday, 25 September, the police asked Kent at the Ashford Office Court to prevent foreign travel from Mr Paul Glad to France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
According to the register for sexual criminals, Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five-year prison sentence.
The police in Kent said that she wouldn't discuss individual cases or glitters possible place of residence in the country.
A spokesperson from Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"We believe that it is easier to control someone in the United Kingdom because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risk."
"It is the top concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behaviour of registered sexual criminals in the country to minimise any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse to two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to take a flight to London.
But he said he was not comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not leave him through passport control and he flew after some and her to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him to enter and he fled back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials were inclined to return to Britain.
Finally, on August 22, he arrived at the terminal 3 in Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the court of office of Uxbridge in West London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for permission to ask him to register as a sexual criminal.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for 4 months in 1999 for the possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was calmed and satisfied that Glitter was stopped to travel to France and Spain.
`I receive the master behind the stage to hold his character', Günter Brauer, photographer.
No paragraphs, no sweaters, no costumes for the appearance.
The nature of the great flame cotants who refrain from concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand artist
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, in these moments that are strange to the audience, I know when I can find typical gestures for the personality, the depth of a stolen view or expression strength of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatrical scenes on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this page he was little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of the flamenco presentation at different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the programme of the month of the Flamenco photography, reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' ``everybody can be, but when you look at the photos, the viewer notes that there are no typical pictures of artists on stage.
Very normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus move the audience.
To hold the personality of these artists, you don't have to make photos on stage.
Their personality and character are in their hearts.
What was interested in creating a personal atmosphere that would allow me to hold the characters of the greatest flame-co master with the photo camera."
Bauer, inspired by the festival `Cante de las Minas', took a long trip in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images created that remember classic photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical basis of the picture, which gives the image the modernity and the idea of how the Bauer Flamenco understands: `music with traditional roots that change and surprise every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who with his art seduces the audience.
The search for the essential, for a certain thing that becomes visible in the form of hearing, being, is and was the firm goal of this work, which is presented in the next time in the El Fotómata gallery.
Known personalities in Flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others belong to the close selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project became an anthology of the Flamencos and will soon appear as a book, with all portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for the portraits led him to take this idea again two years ago and to achieve it as 'portraits of the veterans of sport' (`SportART project').
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, the photographer to `it gives me great pleasure to photograph the people, to meet them and to put me into their state of life, whether for a short moment or for a long time.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genus in the field of photography.
You meet yourself or look at people, personalities that you sometimes don't know, or they leave you for a couple of minutes alone to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to achieve my ideas."
The collection of the portraits of the Flamencos today entitled `Flamenco-people' is exhibited in the gallery of the El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he just writes is 'a great virtue'.
He still does not know where the novel's action takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistent trying to advance the project at which he is currently working, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived 20 years in the Congo and moved to the Amazon region.
Yesterday, during his presence at the festival of Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel Prize carrier admitted that the project with which he is busy is 'a great virtue' and `all points out that he should not write the novel'.
`If I were thinking, I wouldn't have done it, but I will do it and hope to finish the novel sometime', so he closed his participation in the festival where ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who won the premium of the festival Hay Festival and which most attended, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was presented by Félix Romeo and found that he had a audience in front of himself, which perceived that the Peruan, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, had not given enough time to go through everything again: as his call for literature developed from 'extraordinary adventure appetite', from 'joying to read' and from 'more than before'; as he writes and 'discipline' to supplement 'the lack of inspiration', his intensive work with documentation, numerous corrections and revisions that he makes; like Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his profession and which are the basis for his stories.
The hispano-American novel writer admitted that there is no way to measure and where to know whether books change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience', stressed Vargas Llosa, who claims that it causes 'effects' and 'brings people even more apart', so I did not ask the writers to leave them easy' and 'take the responsibility' for his calling '.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play with: bullfighters fell partially out.
After the announced bullfighters found that the floor of the square was in bad condition, the bull fight with which the festival was to be completed in Pozoblanco was transferred to yesterday morning.
Thus, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, the organizer decided to move the bullfight.
Thus the festival was exposed to unharmed weather, so two of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, so the second intended bullfight could not be celebrated.
The group of Matadore consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullfarena.
So there was only a Friday celebration.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
The same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and one ear of the bull, which had succeeded him more by galopping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he had been so badly fought, a large part of the audience responded to his second fight with bouh ropes.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, loaded with two thousand kilos of Haschisch.
Tomorrow: five minutes ago ten.
Transport controls in Ertzaintza, in the city area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two policemen urged the drivers of the car to stop, so they took the escape.
It looked like they wouldn't have to stop with the charge of more than two thousand kilos of Haschish.
The police persecuted them and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old known as A.A. J., as it was told by the Ministry of Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and counterfeiting official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the Transport Police of the region Álava had already completed the transport control on the N-1 and passed through the city area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and attempted to escape control.
The police began the persecution until the car stopped on the edge line after a few kilometres. At the moment the drivers rose out of the car to flee over a road into a forest area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug dealers transported 2,178 kilo of Haschisch, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with Haschischbündels, which were later led to the exact laboratory analysis and to the weighing of the bundle to other police departments.
In addition, the officials noted that the mark was 'doubled', so it did not correspond to the marks indicated in the car papers, so a arrest was also carried out for counterfeiting official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continue the investigations to carry out the arrest of the second suspect who, as already mentioned, could flee but also determine the origin of the drug confiscated.
The arrested 28-year-old A.A. J. was brought to a police department for interrogation and was presented to the prisoner in the next hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested because of driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
The actress Heather Locklear, known by the role of Amanda in the "Melrose Place" series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effect of an unknown medicine.
One Witness watched how she tried to get out of her park gap in Montecito in a rather strange way, reports spokesman of the California traffic police to the magazine `People'.
The Witness told in detail that Locklear was pushing gas pedal after 16:30 and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car back or forward from the park gap, and when she drove back, she caught her sunbrows a few times.
Something later, the witness who had probably not known the actress at the beginning that Locklear kept on a nearby road and drove out of the car.
The Witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she had 'anxiety for Locklears'.
When the police strip came, they found the actress sitting in her car, which stood across the street and thus blocked traffic.
`She seemed to be unoriented', so they brought the police into a special drug and alcohol center to make a test.
According to a police speaker, the actress showed himself cooperative, excessive alcohol consumption was excluded from the first moment. `The first observations of officials followed, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown medicine', says the speaker.
Locklear was arrested under the suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and brought into a local detention at 19 o'clock.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released after treatment from the hospital in Arizona, where she was treated against anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Association of the United Left becomes responsible for the case of Silva.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and members of the United Left, has today assured that the Regional Association for Education will be the one who will make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports of the City Hall in Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who had resigned last week after he was accused of making business with family members.
`In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take responsibility for this', Llamazares pointed out what approach the party must have to be compared to the one who is still sitting as a city council in the municipal council of Seville.
Nevertheless, the president of the VL defended the need for 'transparence' in the possible investigations of the rules infringements that Silva may have started: `The VL always relied on such cases to obtain maximum transparency'.
With regard to this subject, he stressed that education has a strict ethical code for all public offices.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero book of Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with approximately 15 million euros investment for the film.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to present 'a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he always admired at the works of the famous novel writer, said Carci today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, this Friday is presented in cinemas and later shown on the broadcaster Telemadrid as a four-hour mini series.
José Luis Garci, a great fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this film, his 'Kindheitstraum' was fulfilled. He owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the autonomous community of Madrid to turn a film on the second century celebration in Madrid on 2 November. Especially because the history was based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the order.
The total contribution of 15 million, presented by the autonomous community of Madrid for filming, Garci, as he added, offers the 'unique possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the picture of `confused Spain, which chose the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been restored by the fight for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII.'
However, the Cineast regrets that it was not expected to finance such as `Alatrists' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (two times as high as `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the screenshot with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost all his career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', has contributed through his usual operation: he stood on the stage to the actors with whom you must first try before you start turning and for those who had not made casting, he appeared 'degrading' and respectful, 'a part of the film director's profession is to provide help in the theatre and in the cinema to know what is happening in the cinema industry in which you work.'
Many actors he finds in 'Sangre de mayo' have to repeat before his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, Oscar Candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Academy of Hollywood represents a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
Garci does not expect awards for this film.
`At the beginning, you think you're working for the offspring, later you notice that it's only for prosperity, and now you're happy if you've produced a movie," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón calls back the memory of the dancer from Sevilla Tórtola Valencia
A flame-cotanizer from Seville honors a dancer who also comes from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusier (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the triana district and, when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and an expert for oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and was set up for the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who has left her traces in the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role that seemed impossible to me.'
`We're not trying to tell about her life without keeping her esprit,' said the flame cotancer.
Your dance bases helped me a lot in Flamenco.
`The dance of the butterfly', for example, occurred to me like Guajira, or `the dance of the snake' like Tango.
Your dancing was sensual and I was told that my dance is also in this aesthetic area,' she claims.
The scenery counts with two extraordinary co-operations: Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel in one of her ideas, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with Flamenco-Meister Matilde Coral, who wanted to work with one of her ex-pupils.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I feel very honored."
The scene also counts with musical composition and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón, with the Percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the Viola of Rafa el Viola and the cooperation with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he takes over the role of the companion of the artists who were Divas in which he is always in love."
In this work we also tell in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in as far as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, although she has lived normally in London.
`I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain period and whose works no longer know and therefore appreciate them even less,' claims Bayón.
The presentation takes place today at 20:30 in the theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married 1916 Zenobia offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture to celebrate the `Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008). The aim is to remember the fiftyth anniversary of the award of the Literature Nobel Prize and the death day of the two.
Thus, the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international convention held in New York, with the restoration of the house museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and the hiking exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', opened in May and after which it was in various places in Andalusia, now reached New York and is presented during the international convention.
The Andalusian Cultural Council has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet more known.
The United States can imagine badly without Paul Newman
`Many times God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation reporter', and from the then prevailing idea of the American cinema that was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his enthusiastic idea and followed her.
Look what it cost her to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very ill.
Nevertheless, this was a big blow for everyone.
`What one sometimes feels is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend', said Robert Redford crying, `my life and my country were the biggest drolls of his life.'
No one was afraid to be ridiculed or exaggerated.
As 'Vater' of the cinema and of the homeland, he died in a sad moment, in which fear of terrorists and the market collapse, in which the depressed sense of self-value of the Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to retain dignity.
If in this hard time without virtue only a few people who can be admired, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he almost embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and suffered as various losses as well as profits: from the foundation that prescribed the fight against drugs and in honor of his son from the first marriage who died of overdose was founded up to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country in which it took a lot of effort to fight a deadly nutrition culture.
A wide wave of surprise strikes home-high over Hollywood without consideration of nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only a man died, but the whole era.
The Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar prize winner, said that the work with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the wicked boy who came from Australia, dared to describe Newman as his greatest inspiration.
`We have left the greatest of all of us', confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who are entrusting to live today as Paul Newman lived: receive high requirements for the rightfulness, a responsible private life, lead far away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today's media jungle.
But there is someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of this.
He divorced one time and was then married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, who he was faithful, although there were certainly many possibilities not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have a filet at home?', he often jolted himself.
In heaven he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
`From all the great roles he played, at none he was as proud as those of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and those of the Philanthrop," they say.
The streets in Madrid are inadequate for the Olympic Games.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to organize some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, 'Are we prepared for it?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say it's not right!
She was called the perfect road, and I judged that she was the worst street with all the drums and the ones there were.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense if you would observe the evaluation and I could check it, it would clearly not have been done.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket picking that allows you to go first.
It doesn't seem bad to me either, but if they let you go, they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the bust on the street).
So don't.
Here you can only get the ticket (the first nonsense that is only to go there) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size `S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it so that after the crisis it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
Well, things like these are a small thing compared to the days on the street.
Apart from that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Waiting has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as it was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks ahead, even if it had succeeded once, but it would be even more difficult to recover.
In addition, it looked like in this 40 minutes waiting after rain, so it came to the temptation to organize a folk uprising and to overtake the house.
I think tomorrow will certainly have some 500 people lung inflammation and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip that I have received, I can already think that the output has been stamped wrongly.
Of course, if you asked me for a perfect road, this road would never interfere with me.
So I think we'll dream a long time from a city that is well prepared for the Olympic Games
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', organised by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image detection system and human interaction, a nature of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, which is, however, capable of performing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, it is a route planner to move on the company's campus). The system takes note of what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a form and face detection system, this 'receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their entertainment.
It can also classify the attendees in the groups after the discussions.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not associated with the group that leads to her conversation, and that no company employee is.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
Everything without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things it can focus on, for example, on the next version of its Windows operating system.
This week they talked very superficially about the strategy change of Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have so many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if the computers were equipped with the most necessarily, instead of filling them with the commercial waste, they would work five times faster. Human, Steven, that will only be for the few.
Everything is just one finding, considering that Microsoft added some function and 'Extras' in Windows versions.
The direction change is worthwhile
The Microsoft is right, the operating system gradually loses importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared in the network, that was part of the theory that it was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Skilledly, many pointed out that the browser is not a operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system fulfils the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to informing his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his 'death', not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirming this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time surfing than in the surroundings of the 'windows'.
What does half of the computer of existing applications serve for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 must be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
The interest of Microsofts is more to integrate its online services, which can then become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, without doubt, and I have a little example of it.
I made the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreational rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
On the refreshment drinking machine is a sign attached: `Your search. Our future'. It prints a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of employees used Microsoft, Google for research on the network.
By the way, last week also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, even 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the possibility to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso has lived in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `Der Pate' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time it belongs to clothing a well-built pastor.
When we start to count the countless stars appearances, we can go back to the image of a very powerful man, with a sharp beard that had raised heavy weight in a hiking circle.
Basically, this is a typical male T-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tailed.
The English-speakers call it 'tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles exceeds all other brands.
First of all, because of its great name, although called in the narrow circle `Marcel'. The legend tells that the name formation is connected to sport and descends from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' excels all because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive Unisex cut and characterized by a small Belgian flag (recognisablely) that have these T-shirts as a detail on the neck section.
And respect, the Belgian company not only focuses on the production of 'tanks'.
You also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cheschmire, pants made of cotton, t-shirts with strips, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very bad to use it as underwear.
They're very exciting.
`I want to be a young mother; I don't worry about the candidate'
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monthica Cruz is delicious, but full of joy in life.
At present, the siblings Gruz takes their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Monica this means much more than for some beautiful and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, relocating her residence there and also making the presentation of the most important premiums in the fashion that sponsors the Spanish fashion house.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short routes.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also visited the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and took part in the dinner to Valentinos honor.
A very intensive working time, which is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I'm fascinated by the cinema of the 50's and 60's; there we find many ideas.
I am happy to go through a city and observe women as they are clothed, as they combine their clothes, I often do it.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think it is, but finally, everything happens in one and these areas have many commons.
Since I was young, I was enthusiastic about the clothing; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to swim around in my aunt’s garments and see her clothes.
That was great to go almost better than to a recreation park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothing.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in classes and at the samples to look into the mirror and feel good at it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you're moving into the real role of actor.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so much respect for the costume designers and their professionality.
You have recently become 30, have you not been in a crisis?
Oh, what?
I feel better than ever, than thirty-year-olds, I feel good.
I think the woman gets mature, has experience and can enjoy life with less mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological watch.
I did the things I wanted to do since I was young, and that gave me much inner joy.
So, you think about being a mother, don't you?
For a long time, I already know that I'm gonna be a mother because this my body demands and I want to be a young mother; I don't want to let myself go.
As for the candidate, I don't worry.
I'll give my child a great feeling of happiness and teach it with a lot of love.
As for film art, you keep in mind the works you have participated in and the last year have been rotated.
That's the same, and I would very much like them to be presented to the public.
As a woman coming from the theater, I am very impatient and unhappy and want to have everything at once that can't be right now.
I wish very much that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be listed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you.
A few days ago, you appeared on the run with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not that I went on the run to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, has just called me and invited me to London to take part in a parade for the charity of their organization `Women for a better world' and the clothing we show. I know that two clothes from our collection for Mango have been auctioned to collect the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
Many things are told about them, and I, as the one she knows, would tell you they don't agree.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which it is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this grand-hearted thing, but when she comes and asks me to make a stand, I will do that too.
In order to support women in the third world, whatever is necessary.
The drivers who can fall back due to the alcohol level will have to install the 'Alcolock'.
The Authority recommends that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install this system in his car, which forbids him to start the car in a drunk state. If he is alcoholized, then the car does not jump on.
The initiative has already been announced in June last month and is already part of the report of the prosecutor-General. According to its statement, it is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to resociate the driver, which is why he receives a course for retraining traffic behaviour.
Apart from the prosecutor-General, experience-based, the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Safety of Automotives will also participate in this.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of the drivers, who were shown more than once because of driving under alcohol influence, were re-engaged.
The `alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the breathed air and prevents Autostart when the driver has made alcohol tests; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the one who imposes sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices have already prevented up to 65% of the infringements in the first year of its introduction.
In Spain, 115 people could be saved every year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to take action before it becomes a criminal offence.
And in order to facilitate their implementation, legal reform can be implemented in the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the basic law is required which is necessary for the criminal enforcement process.
The equipment is still available on the Spanish markets, not in any business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House will vote tomorrow for the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Worker Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses, which has already been made in France.
In Mexico and without 'pep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time planned by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México Airport, DF landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, traveling with the Prince and Prince of Asturia.
The sun went down, but their beams have still forced to use the hand as a umbrella to see the royal pair that went out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before that, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the prince and the prince of Asturia were visiting the city to formalize the official journey.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport around this time you're from here or so
No, she's the Spanierin, but she lived here for a couple of years.
-Okay, very good.
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the Prince and Prince of Asturia is and knows the importance of the journey.
There are many who are waiting in the Hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 marine soldiers, which give honor salve.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair weaned by the wind, without usual 'peep-toes', perhaps was told her that it was expected a thunder in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers in which the official sequence is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from the Mexican television is waiting for her to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no significant fashion designer and Bonvivanten than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international increase of young fashion talents.
This is awarded with a money price of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings in the display window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and has recently been opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is located in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with thanking the fashion designer Valentino for his jury presidentship in the competition. Everything ended with a luxury dinner in Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed to be spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother died recently, was crushing together. He dressed the suit from the fashion house and had some jewelry of ELAH that were stunning. He held on the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters large and accompanied Valentino with the dinner, to his honour.
Andik, the owner and master of the mango house, greeted the guests and was so a cavalier, so he ended with the baron of Rotschild without jackets, for jackets they borrowed the ladies.
Monica Cruz, has rushed to the business and had a pants and a shirt that she modeled herself, and to dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. At a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet samples, so she was in excitement, remembered the old times, grabped a rod and made a kind of 'grand'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the spaces of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality that always excites a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who, after his arrival (with own bed covers and towels) in the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smell.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's the way life is.
1001 Council against stress
There is no 1000 more, but one way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And if there are few, all are collected in a book in which it stands how to relax. The book comes to the books on September 30.
The alarm clock is a penalty when it sounds at 7 a.m., but even worse, the idea appears to come back into the witch rhythm that requires the current life.
The office is the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
The stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to fight daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnecting from the working world.
But the number increases, no more and no less than 1001.
Besides yoga stands, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott represents in the book the entire list of possibilities that are adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress is called `1001 options to relax' and so the rest that the book conveys comes into the bookshops of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks it is impossible to achieve peace in such areas as the workplace with the help of personal contacts, this manual objects to such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered how to stay in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore the body's balance and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talk in sleep
Some children speak at night
I mean not those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
If it happens to you for the first time, in the best case you will be scared, but in reality it has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite widespread, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, more than one of you was told that you talked at night.
This phenomenon may occur occasionally (a time in life, such as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, connections with other phenomena are sought in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, Enuresis noctura (between nights), searched for talk in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be at very high fiber, stress situations or overestimation.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that one speaks quietly in individual words, whispers or it can be quite a opposite (cries, wines, long discussions).
In cases where the expression is very intense, it is recommended that the child be monitored and advised by a specialist to check if there is a problem which causes fear and thus occurs.
We have said it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disturbance that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnoe or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple prevention measures:
Don't try to raise the child before sleeping.
So choose a quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and something too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner rest.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
If the talk occurs once in sleep, try to keep the rest.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake up.
This is useless, for the child is unconscious, so you will rip it out of sleep.
Although the child speaks, it sleeps, so it rests.
Remember, if it appears scared after a couple of phenomena, it is recommended to be advised or to find out the reason for the child’s fear.
When they understand what it says (what is not so usual), the child does not put under pressure to carry out an understanding and get more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps it is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Moreover, you will hear what it says, but you will not know what it dreams and why it says that this is why they are careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions that draw you from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
So don't worry, it's nothing bad, that's a moment that takes only a few minutes.
Il-houses... finally
After a long thirst track, ill houses on the field are finally back on a success course.
Without great effort, the yellow blacks played many torchances and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, with which the attackers had difficulty to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose distance shot was nearly passing by the angle, ill houses should dominate the game with ease, and it was only a fonderflict with a remote shot, then a brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge Denmark's defense.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field and left only the vibrant Riahi at the top of the storm.
The beginning of the second half should be decisive with first two torchances fought by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately with the first gate for the ill houses by Marais, who was right to accept a ball that had been defensed by Diebold in a first attempt.
However, the Illusion Torschütze should not be able to enjoy his luck for a long time and be sent to the bank about twelve minutes later, making it necessary to keep his teammates in number.
However, Denmark did not know how to exploit this and did not face a illhaeus elephant problems, which were just a little retracted to 'compensate' their defense, except in the last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the late after a great break.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another descent to the Bretagne.
In view of the decisive attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norwegian ports on Monday, the French President decided to find themselves in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him 'with a constructive spirit' and hope that he will come with 'concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a General Assembly of the Crisis Committee founded by the British fishermen in order to implement measures in view of the extreme increase in the diesel price, which reached an average record value of more than 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the press speaker of Elyséepalast David Martinon `the President will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the working conditions and the payment of sailors'.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
On Tuesday morning, they led in the Morbihan and Calvados protest fair, which caused the stud of nearly ten kilometers of length.
The sailing port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was bordered with a lock.
On Monday the sailors expressed their determination by burning tyres and pallets from early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while being held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc demonstrations.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and the Channel, such as Sables d`Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish feeder did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the maneuver of trade ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the major total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday before they decide on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee must decide on the reactions to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some British fishermen do not want to be represented by the responsible members of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
`The strike will continue', because 'the fishermen will not give up at any point' and 'will not go to Paris', e.g. Liliane Cariou, President of the Fisheries Committee of Lorient.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be achieved with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman of the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at 83 years of age as a result of cancer in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes adopted by the cinema legend and engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 airplanes delivered this year, despite the threatening recession, to be a threat to the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much from the Chinese market, especially for its planes of size from 30 to 120 seats.
Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider spending more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the American International Group, which was financially supported by the American Monetary Authority, considers to spend more than 15% of its assets in order to reimburse the $85 billion that he had been preceded.
AIG is willing to control the sale of a large part of its businesses, beyond their life insurance at international level and their age precautions in the United States.
According to the FT, the Board of Directors of the AIG met Sunday evening to verify possible sales.
There was no confirmation at the AIG.
Among the assets that AIG might separate from, its aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% share in the back-insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in the Private Equity, the FT further explains.
No definitive decision has been taken on such sales, the FT continues.
AIG has to make sales faster to reimburse the loans over 85 billion that it has granted the Federal Reserve, including the risk that the American authorities receive 80% of their capital and the current shareholders are lost at the same rate.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks, a historical case of courses: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss of nearly 800 points ever before, and the noseday 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has fallen by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As regards the points, the strongest case of his history (684.81 points) was previously recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the decline in trade following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
According to the final drop-off figures, the Nasday index, mainly concerning technology, has decreased by 199.61 points to 1.983.73, and the widespread standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was to allow some stability on the markets again, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
On the other hand, with 228 votes and 205 votes, the MEPs refused the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`Here a bad picture is circulated, which represents the Congress as incapable of adopting a plan', said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan', added it, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come too late'.
`If the project is actually condemned to fail (...), it will be the task of the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank, Anm. d. Red.) and other central banks to cope with the crisis, which would be more limited to the credit conditions', warned Brian Bethune, CEO of Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, in which she highlighted the feeling of extreme urgency, 'that every day that disperses, brings the ruin of a financial company' in the United States `'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to purchase the bank transactions of Wachovia by its competitors Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated and thus led to emergency measures in favour of banks in the United Kingdom, in the Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, a sign of the fact that the markets are facing not only an American but a global crisis, added the FTN Financial Analytics.
The market for basic goods has grown strongly.
The income of the State fund in ten years dropped from 3.632% to 3.827% Friday evening, and revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama, winner by points in the first television
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House of Friday followed another to find out who was the winner of it, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory for the election of both Republicans and Democrats in this television program, which was to be persecuted by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, although quite apparent, was not 'brillant' enough to allow him to stop his decline in election issues five weeks before the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, from which a survey of opinions was published on Saturday, said Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the democrat clearly makes the better figure.
Obama was awarded 39% as a winner from the surveys, while, according to a CBS survey, 25% of them saw McCain as a winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
`It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts, but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not stop focusing on his indispensable experience in the field of foreign policy, in which he clearly underlined the 'natility' of his opponent with regard to these issues, which was the center of this first television issue.
`Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
`I do not believe that Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president', he also assured.
An attack point which has been preached since yesterday in the Republican election spots.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely, without being made up of it.
He put his ability to make good decisions and renew the picture that the world has of the United States.
`McCain has still not understood, however, Obama already', this weekend put a democratic campaign against where Republicaner was accused of not having recorded the complete extent of the crisis that lies on the `American of the street'.
`With the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you', Obama agreed to 20,000 people who had gathered in flowing rain during a election event in northern Carolina yesterday.
He did not even mention the words 'middle' or 'workers'. 'The financial crisis provides Obama, which the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy even at the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The next week could represent a decisive turning point', estimated yesterday the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
The democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the government of Clinton, compared the 'good economic instinct' Obamas with those of Bill Clinton during the financial crisis of 1998.
For the democratic candidates, the current crisis is 'the final judgment of an eight-year bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain'.
After reiterating that he would even manage to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, was the highest priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build an installation of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully addressed the questions that the plan for the saving of the financial market covers more than $700 billion (EUR 470 billion), which was adopted last night by the Congress and is extremely unpopular to the people.
`Did you notice that there was a choice in Minsk?'
Young people and opposing parties demonstrated Sunday evening at the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred white cruises gathered Sunday evening since the closure of the elections at the Minsk marketplace to protest against the fraudulent character of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had been announced, many young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukakenko: `The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they haven't chosen at all: 'What does that benefit if they do with my voice what they want,' says a youth.
They do not believe that the regime, which has been best shown to the foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, is willing to carry out a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-dividing of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the putting up of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were estimated by the observers as clean.
According to the opposition, they weren't.
`We were excluded from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the counting,' Juri Potemkin, press speaker of the Union's democratic forces, a heterogeneous merger of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, stressed by Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is important who tells the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If Members of the opposition enter into Parliament, then because they were appointed, and not chosen.
But their entry into Parliament may mean broadcasting time on television, meeting in the regions and legislative proposals.
The opposition is therefore guilty of interfering with the political game, because dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is strongly indebted to Russia, enters into a crisis and we are not reforming, we are at risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election, does not recognise the election as valid.
It stresses that the voters appear too high and that the extension of the voting tax in advance (26% of Minsk's voters) gave the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Did you notice that a choice took place?, asks the leader of the Social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
No one was in the election halls.
And there will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition in Parliament, and those who are most likely to comply with the government's ideas.
The silence of the night is sinking again over the October square.
On television, President Lukakenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate on their success.
Discussion - From Blood that was safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its founding, and her president, Dr. Francine Décary, had all reason to rejoice because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And, above all, it recovered the confidence of the public, which was severely shocked by the scandal of polluted blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As you know, the national blood reserves managed by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HI virus and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
Given this drama and the public's dissatisfaction, the Government of Canada initiated in February 1994 a public investigation led by the judge Horace Krever aimed at bringing light to the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and drafting directives to prevent another catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitating to submit his report, several provinces at the time placed a committee on the legs whose goal was to develop a new system for the management of blood conservations in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this commission.
According to the reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were founded in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian blood society to provide the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, hardly 38% of people had confidence in the blood conservation system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood conservations and through the work in this area during the following years, we have recovered the public's confidence before proudly stressing that at the beginning of 2008 almost 94% of Quebec's population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that `confidence is something extremely fragile'.
Hema-Quebec has been acting in accordance with the principle of caution since its founding on 28 September 1998.
At this time, we experienced the occurrence of many cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman who has been the leadership since the founding of 1998.
`And we didn't have the least idea whether this disease could be transmitted over blood.
So we call on one of the main directives of the reports by Krever and Gélineau, which suggests that we apply exclusion measures, if we do not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case in the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is expressed by a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, there was no acceptance of blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than one month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago, without any doubt it was proved that this disease was transmitted over the blood.
This event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied has quite a sense.
In 1999, a much more precise technique for detecting HIV was published on the market: The nucleic acid tests (NST) allowing the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the previously used tests.
The NST allowed it to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be proved by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than one week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors could be infected without knowing it and you could not recognize this has been significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one of 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
`In other words, this means that you should distribute 12 million blood conservations before someone is infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec is distributed between 400,000 and 500,000 blood conservations each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs where HIV was transmitted via a blood conservation.
I think that today you can feel comfortable when you get or write a blood transfusion to restore health," says the director of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know what pathogens can get into the system.
Only last year on the island of Réunion has the Chikungunya virus appeared, which, just like the Westnil virus, is transmitted by insects over the blood.
We have to monitor continuously," continues Dr. Décary before she stresses that Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supply next to a safe supply.
`Demand increases because the population ages.
Since cancer control treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or blood plates.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which is an average of only 3% of Quebec's blood donations.
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and who meets the criteria for fitness can spend blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of those who provide their blood are not accepted because they are, for example, AIDS or malaria, and whoever has traveled to a country where malaria is spread is excluded from blood donation for a year.
`With these 3% we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of stocks are very rare.
But you need to renew the members of this donor network if they are older and can no longer donate blood.
It is difficult to convince people of donating blood, but above all to keep them and bring them to become regular donors.
Life is so witty today that you rarely find the time to spend an hour of blood donation," regrets Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec delivers not only blood conservations but also human tissues, including bone transplants, cardiovascular valves, augap and skin, which is almost exclusively used in severe burning.
These tissues are investigated, processed and frozen before they are stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public navel cord of Quebec.
In the needle cord, which was previously considered biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells that can be used to treat severe diseases, such as leukaemia.
`A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth navel snorkel blood sample, and we plan to decrease more than a thousand per year.
`We should begin to make it available for transplants at the beginning of next year', continues Dr. Décary, who describes this program of navel cord reduction as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced not to have access to it' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in Halffinal
Montreal's Impact has been qualified yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all gates) against the sounders from Seattle at the second and decides to play the Quarterfinal series in the Saputo Stadium, where the overall gate ratio counted, for the half-final round of the excretion games of the USL's first League.
The middle field player Antonio Ribeiro shot the decisive gate in the ninetiest game minutes.
After a first half-time without a gate for both one and the other side, the middle field players David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for Montreal's formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who was in the way Matt Jordan for the sounders.
Let us remember that at the first game of the pre- and replay series on Friday Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukuila in a suburb of Seattles had introduced a 2 to 1 low position.
In the half-final Impact will be measured with the white caps from Vancouver.
On Saturday evening, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 victory in Minnesota, but the Whitecaps, with a total door ratio of 5 to 4, still entered the half-final round.
Impact will probably have to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the play series are set today.
In short - Siegestor through Kovalev
The number 1 Trio of the Canadian team is ready to attack the season.
Last night, the unit formed from Alex Kovalev, Tomas Placeanec and Andrej Kostitsyn pushed the attack on the Panther from Florida with a stormfire, which led to a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a gate, placeanec delivered two templates and Kovalev transformed a passport in this victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore into six preparation games.
Kovalev won the victory by shooting the only gate of all shooting.
`I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel comfortable. '
"In the first half of his life, Guy Carbonneau noticed that he was too close to it.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He got a stormy applause.
Charest sets on the north
The Prime Minister does not exclude opening elections before the end of the year.
Once the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (Linke), attempts to be elected in the election today.
`The course of our last great border in the north: this is the long-term goal Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levi, where he followed entirely the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of image mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens spectacular images of water power plants, mines, viewed by Quebec in 'Google Maps', maps, etc.
Large resources such as during the election period.
Against the press, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would hold the elections this autumn, even if he said that his calendar was very full.
The 'Plan Nord' is the fourth element of a 'Vision', which the Prime Minister claims has for Quebec, namely that of a 'new economic area', which provides agreement with France on workers, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreement with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister in recent times, the opening of the north - the northern area at the 49th latitude - has never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was limited to explaining why the North is 'a jewel with enormous potential' but did not mention a date, no investment sums or precise priorities for the coming projects.
Most of a few views of what could be done more: water energy, forest, but especially mining, is favourable by the growth of emerging countries and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to the list of Mr. Charests, the north has `nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice as big as France' `is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just in our vicinity, it's in us', he emphasized how to show clearly that he is looking for a national founding room to be realised.
Quebec has grown very much by his connection with the North, he stressed: the road to gold in Abitibi, the Quebec technology, the James book.
`It belongs to us, it is our future', he added after he had put a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The north, 70% of Quebec's area, includes part of Labrador, which Quebec has always requested, the Prime Minister of the Press declared.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity is given, I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
Moreover, with climate change, we have to rethink our vision from the north," he explained and spoke about the North-West Passage, which will be fable all year round due to the ice-melting.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is just a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the inhabitants, and the indoors?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would handle them very cautiously and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pekist Member of Ungava), have already initiated discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and soil resources) takes an important place, has taken up the work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large congregation, 'not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity in which `man will create a common vision'.
The development of the North will also take place in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Nord plan will be 'deliberate, regulated and environmentally clean', he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'Vision' as if she was a continuation of those of the liberal Prime Minister who were in office before him.
`Just like the liberals that were in front of us, we have reconsidered to transform the challenges into new growth and development cycles.
This was, by the way, one of the frequently raised themes of the weekend, opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the party leadership by Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted provides for the conversion of the power plant of Beauharnois to Adélard-Godbout-Staudamm.
`Von Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, about Lesage, who has reached the silent revolution and the state of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James book, our party always knew to determine the future', explained Jean Charest.
On the other hand, he referred to another, this time conservative project, namely the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the water power damm Eastmain1a-Ruper project, Mr Charest stresses that it is intended to start for 2012.
`This remains among us, but I am in charge of being there,' he trusted his party members, which cried out at those pitfalls.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly in 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility to make this autumn a choice which is possible from the law.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, especially because of a mission of the Council of the Community in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly of the weekend provided the Liberal Party Chief a platform from nationalist plans, especially from 'the constitutional objectives', which have been adopted without delay: the PLQ demands in particular the recognition of the 'Quebean speciality' in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
From the sides of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord Plan have been incorporated with skepsis.
The Chief of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has re-established the development policy of the North Du-Quebec, which the government has introduced Landry in 2001.
It believes that the liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, has failed to apply it.
If she had done it, we're already going much further today, Mrs. Marois judged Françoise Mercure on the side of her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election takes place today).
The ADQ has agreed to support the adoption of a North plan by the government.
`But what we want is that this is not just a big idea', said the party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from the holiday today.
Letter - A defenced country
Mr. Vic Toews, Ex-'Justiz' Minister (which is irony) in the cabinet Harper, who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a 'shame' for Canada.
This woman, who has led an unending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover shame, says as much about the people around the Prime Minister as Stephen Parker himself.
We have to do with a government that, as the only one from all the countries concerned, has not brought home their countryman caught in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things happened that were being cast on him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier tackle under inhuman conditions.
The only one that drops into a judicial parody to assess the debt of the defendant.
Let us remember that, above all, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian lawyers plead to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair process in Canada.
This government also closes its eyes before torture: it is little interest that a young adult will certainly have been emotionally broken for all time after so many years of torture.
We are not aware of this yet, but here we are experiencing a subtle circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our `democracy', this word that Harper always wears like a flag before itself, and that sounds so insignificant from his mouth.
Thus, the time has come when there is no more morality: one can abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen arbitraryly, even after a government leader who is only supported by the minority to this day (may he be entirely a minority after 14 October...).
Many voters believe to find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has abandoned the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this release, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The Orwell speech of Barrick Gold
Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-General Director of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold in her issue of 17 September.
This confirms, and pursues an orwellic logic that the world's largest gold-winning company aimed at a blasphemy complaint of more than six million against three authors and a small medium-less publishing house, with the aim of opening a 'public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of blasphemy complaints, but in the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference has been completely deteriorated by Mr Garver.
For for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate is to drive everyone into the ruin who dares to represent one of their opposed opinions.
Regardless of the process, the authors and the publishers of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight with very uneven weapons against an army of lawyers paid from the nearly inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics in these uneven fights are also often to ruin the defenders in order to force a agreed regulation which makes the opposite and also horrifies anyone who dares to reconsider the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she had to present her view of things before public opinion.
Contrary to what is going on in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually carried out in Canada by the exchange of ideas and not by knobble thieves.
So it would have been enough if the gold mine had revealed their books and documents and opened a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and financing of independent test teams that could have brought light to this question.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes the petitions and letters to support the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could Mr Garver explain how he can call for a 'public' debate at the same time, but would he not just disregard the opinions of this public?
Apparently, this word in the world of the Vice-President consists only of the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very limited view of the term.
In democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does this especially because it rejects the brutal attitude of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not in a framework that many perceive as a Knebel complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold just addressed a demand to the authors of Noir Canada, in which they demand that they no longer use this term...).
Apart from the surreal speech of Mr Garver, the complaint of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the truth-finding, which is fundamental to every democratic society.
It completely denies the right to quote credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not like the rich companies in this world, who else can do this?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The universitary environment we have long known to tackle debates and disagreements and to solve conflicts.
The disproportionate complaint of Barrick Gold clearly shows that, unlike what it suggests, it does not desire a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it will be time for governments to take measures to restrict this kind of unjustified complaint.
Rescue action for Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand themselves
The administration of Bush and the executive congress delegates, Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over $700 billion to stop the financial crisis, which has been shaken by Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two congress chambers.
The main content is: a better control of MEPs on the practical application of the plan, of new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the public funds used, of new provisions to reduce the number of houses funded due to payment residues, and of the right to monitor salaries paid to the managers of the assisted companies.
American financial secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, and the representatives of Republicans, Senator Judd Gregg, who were present at the negotiations yesterday, announced a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiation marathon.
`We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the market,' said the representative of the administration of Bush, Henry Paulson.
`It happened all to protect the real economy and the American people from the course crisis at Wall Street', the democrat explained.
`This is the fundamental point: If we do not, the dream, the chaos and the unrests will be enormous in the daily life of the Americans'," explained the Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, because of fear of the effect that would have had a renewed failure on the mood of investors.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who took part in the negotiations lately, showed themselves rather as supporters of the agreement, but not to express their dissatisfaction about having to meet them in this extreme way.
Democracy senator Barrack Obama consisted of the addition of certain provisions to agree, especially those to allow owners to retain their homes, and those who relate to the salaries of the executive employees of the companies saved by the State.
`If taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures due to the lack of responsibility for certain persons, this is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary', he explained on the American television stations.
When he was asked on another transmitter if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I would like to know the details, but I hope.
`The principles I have read show that this is a thing that we will all need to digest, and with which we will be able to advance.
The option to do nothing at all is simply not acceptable', he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is aimed at using the money of taxpayers
It comes 14 months after a crisis that triggered the placing of a real estate bubble, which first led to the collapse of risky mortgage credits (subprime) before extending to further forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and finally to freezing the financial power and ruining of banks and money institutions.
A group of Republican MEPs had failed the first attempt to agree last week.
Since the democrats have accepted that certain 'toxic' assets of the societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not be purchased, the Sackgasse is believed to escape.
In order to complete the perspective for everyone at the Congress, one has also added a decision that, if the government should make losses with this programme within five years, it could then impose new taxes in order to retain its invested capital.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, which can add to another 100 billion if the President considers it necessary.
The further 350 billion payments must be adopted by the Congress again.
In return to his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring dividends to him in the case of profits and which can sell it again when the storm has passed over.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the retention procedures relating to the housings bound by the real estate loans covered by this plan, and also to set deadlines for the reimbursement and deductions paid to the leading employees of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of MEPs to vote on him today, and then the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not sure that their plan will get green light.
In fact, yesterday, other votes were raised against this project, both by the Republicans and by the Democrats.
'Of course Washington doesn't understand us,' said the Republican Scott Garett, member of the Financial Commission of the Chamber, his voters.
`Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not those who are in asking the taxpayers for cash.
The democratic MEP Brad Sherman, head of a group at the Congress called 'the Caucus of Skeptics', represents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent economic professors, including three nobel prize winners, have written to tell us: We ask the Congress not to be put under pressure, and carefully consider what is going on," he said yesterday.
At the same time, we have again received evidence in Europe that it is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial government of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The entry of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was necessary after the French Bank announced that it would refrain from buying her competitor who was in great difficulties since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) in the crisis due to the risky real estate credits in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'That's not a lost money, said Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos yesterday.
To compensate, we receive a right of election and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the sparers and households appreciate now since uncertain times announce themselves. '
During this time, on the other side of the Canal, the British government was just about to state another bank which was under threat from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at the Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion dollars) from real estate loans.
The Spanish Bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would, after Northern Rock, be the second bank that the British government has to state since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty with the azur blue eyes was long his trunk, no one would say his weakness.
Was the American actor freed from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, sensitivity, and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that brings the truly terrible monster to the world.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on the consequences of lung cancer on his ranch in Connecticut remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he liked and for whom he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his act, and certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the jumping of dramatic conventions.
Missing blood often gives wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 as the son of a German Jews and a Hungarian mother.
One of the fameful faces of the American dream should come from its European roots.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality.
Because in him a whole country that was in love with the self-made-man was reflected in the fighters who were injured in the Pacific War, who studied acting art in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's studio in New York before he had success in the theatre, television and soon also in the cinema.
This man, who fought for civil rights, was also the driver who became a 24-hour race of Man's Second in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he lived in a show relationship with the actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reluctant, engaged and oversensitive star, whose puzzles you will never completely solve.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the cinema lovers to Taumel this weekend, while on the dark screen of the memories all his major roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art moves over with him in constant change.
The charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) is again in memory, and the young man who reverts his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot sheet roof, filmed in 1958 by Tennessee Williams.
A much shorter remembrance (1990) is awakened to his sensitive Lord Bridge, who is disturbed at his high age by a wedding that did not fulfill all their promises.
There were so many other Paul Newmans in history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (a handful of dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was intended for James Dean, was resumed after his death and made the Newman in 1956 properly known.
This sympathetic Ganove in the superb The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar in 1973 for the best film.
As a bitter and revengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Ross (1961),
This face through the times, that's what he was.
He's still.
In his career, epochs unite.
The youth knows him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little orthodox trainer of an ice hockey team.
In 1994, his fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as a Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema legends who have withdrawn early enough from the film world, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time and tell Hollywood, his wealth, his sprinkle and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the 'Underplaying' when he judged his all too strong achievements.
The meter wasn't always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he played rare Sunnyboys as outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, fishers or desperates, with their perfect representation, he reflected his rebellion.
As director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true fine sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel of 1968 (after the novel of the Canadian Margaret Laurence) and his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, recorded a fine women's portrait full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son, a work full of fine feeling and sadness to this year.
At the flood of honours that went on to Newman yesterday, his close friend and former arms companion Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) explained extremely: `His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Greatness and joy in life were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great defender of citizens' rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, a opponent of Hollywood's abdrift, is going away.
We have often seen him standing with the foot in shells full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and we thought this was quite tasteless, even though we found it fun at the beginning.
However, the profits from his turnovers flew into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Immer and to the end your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here."
And for us it was an honour to be allowed to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and widest sense.
What was produced in the accounting factory of supplement &amp; Co.?
On 8 October, the negotiations in the criminal proceedings against János' supplement and its complicities begin.
In particular, the defendant is accused of involvement in organised crime, as well as gross maladministration and fraud, and other criminal offences, including document counterfeiting.
According to the prosecutor, the funds obtained from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often used with counterfeit invoices.
State funds and subsidies from self-administration - a total of HUF 65 million - are intended to be partly fought into the financial assets of the Fiatal Baloldal organisation, partly into the private boxes of individuals.
As the investigative authorities announced, in relation to tenders, fictional accounts were submitted, and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the complaint, most of the invoices have been faked.
The invoice blocks were purchased by Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices are to be issued was decided on that journey north of Lake Plate, to which Isván Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploration tour" Lados should find pensions and restaurants.
He required bills on consumers to later be able to issue bills based on these templates for the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-administration of Budapest.
These bills should have been manipulated by Isván Lados and his complicate András
One of the goals of Lados' "Erkundungstour" was a beer resort.
As two invoices issued by supplement and co in 2003, the gastronomy company is supposed to have acquired the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
But now the boss of the company says that such a large group wouldn't have fitted into the local once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövůért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also highlighted serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can't house more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests should have stayed according to account.
The imagination of the accounting counterfeiters was apparently no limits as it was about the Pigal Kft., a gastronomy operation in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövůért and Hoppá according to the prosecution authority do not appear at all.
As managing director Gyůzů Farkas of hvg.hu informed, he immediately realized that it was fake documents when documents were submitted by the prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and the tax number were incorrect on the stamp."
And further: Apart from form errors, the fact that the operation should have housed one hundred people after having a total of 11 rooms that could not offer so many people space.
Also on the invoice, the restaurant has been out of service for a long time.
The emerging counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they took into their visa offers only travel abroad, so they have indicated Hungary rices on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As known in the course of the investigations, they have also quoted VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are tax-free.
The amount of VAT issued by the Hotel Révfulöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövért Foundation was incorrect, since the operation was calculated instead of 25 per cent of VAT, and only machine invoices are issued by employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another error, which had been undermined by the "reputation loans", was that in one case they had given "war transport" as a performance provided, although this is not offered by the company specialised in investment advice, the prosecutor informed.
Further form errors - false invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be dealt with as counterfeitings.
Similarly, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Sports Camp Kunfehértó, whose managing directors reiterated never to have issued the invoices.
Another "error" is the fakes of the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: this society was in resolution at the time (2001) when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass manager therefore stated that the invoices did not have issued themselves.
Known Fake
The other group of accounting officers are persons who were well aware that they would have to lay fictional invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, at an altitude of approximately 4 million HUF.
According to the complaint, the Managing Director of Collab Kft. was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional bills.
Biogate Kft., which is also present in liquidation, has also worked together with a supplement and co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have provided the Jobb Jövůért Alapítvány Foundation, as well as the Atlasz Egyesület and Vorösfenyů Egyesület with counterfeit invoices in the total value of HUF 5 million in respect of unpaid services.
However, there was no payment, as the invoices were canceled immediately after their exhibition, but what the data subjects have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accounting officers shall include persons directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postboy of the Ukrainian Managing Director of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trade company located in Budapest, but not found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices on the sale of EDV components in the total value of HUF for the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigation authority, the cash investment kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, has acted as buyers of these invoices.
Managing Director of this company was a Romanian to which Iván Kubatov should also provide the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov has issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH. to the Associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and has collected its counterpart.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. as well as the Jos investment Bt. should have been founded by Romanian Maurers on Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In fact, however, none of these companies were active, according to the accused of lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: on request of his complainant, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was responsible for preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with a contract, such as atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Cubaatov has issued 15 accounts of the total value of HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organisations.
The prosecutor assumes that Cuba could have collected 10% of the bill and VAT each.
Kubatov has even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional invoices - in this case, the invoices were submitted to the applications of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organisation of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA") in January 2006.
Both received 500,000 forints, but these amounts have benefited from non-profit purposes.
In order to cover this, they submitted five fictional bills of the Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
These invoices were also ensured when searching the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
During the negotiations, some defendants are now charged with a confession on the way in which they were dealt with invoicing as they were already taken before the prosecutorship.
A sensation could be if the main defendant János decided to grant a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report extensively on everything, his confession still stands out.
The question therefore remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have completed a pact with him regarding the rehabilitation of the majority of the damage caused by HUF 50 million, and whether supplement is willing in return to take over the responsibility.
It is possible, however, that the "injured" now plays a supplement after his requests for mildening the deaf ears of imprisonment and house arrest.
While other criminals who have done much greater damage with economic offences and who have not paid them, are free, or at least under house arrest, this possibility remains forbidden.
The psychology of surrender - or why we are willing to pay more
In the event of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overevaluate the misleading commands.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behaviour.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to beat themselves in a competition, such as a auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excess prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
A group of volunteers should play lotto while the others participated in a playful action - in both cases the active brain regions of volunteers were investigated with functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain belt, was measured in the losers of the auction, in which the opponent's surrender plays an essential role.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-payment" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, economists in the research group have carried out additional investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should offer against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was notified the real value of the product and then they made their use.
Another group was also promised 15 dollars of reward, in case they were winning from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which were also lost in the case of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore simply that the emphasis on the one was on the profit, while the other was on the loss.
However, as evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologians, the members of the group playing against losing were prepared to be higher than those in the control group or the "wine" group.
"These results can be derived from no previous economic theory.
These have just just established the practices observed in auctions with the pleasure of gaining or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories was dissolved thanks to the picturesque neurologic procedures, so that we now have a third explanation" - said Andrew Schotter, Professor of the Economic Faculty of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to look for?
Worldwide around half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected countries is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is due to the fact that patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the term of collection for various viruses of infectious liver diseases.
Symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and yellowishness are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ.
Hepatitis viruses are spreading to two different types: in hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. through contaminated food or water), in hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted by blood and other body fluids (e.g. sperm, secrets or spices).
Travellers are recommended vaccination against the viruses A and B in any case, there is no vaccine against the virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A are shown approximately two-three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and fracture.
Afterwards the yellow suit appears on the skin and in the eyes, the chair becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die every year from hepatitis B diseases such as liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that estimates suggest that only one tenth infected is in drug therapy.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen destroys the liver cells secretly - in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular inspections, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease occurs more common: those who had been subjected to blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooed.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease is already evidenced in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to visit the doctor for the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognizably, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thus exposing the risk of infection and preventing cancer.
The 30th September is the World Day of Hepatitis, organised for the first time in 2004 by patient representations worldwide.
The aim of the action is to strengthen awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its origin and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As the latest research results show that religious faith acts like a kind of "smudge" that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It has been studied to what extent belief in God affects human pain, the British sheet "Telegraph" reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists received electric shocks, while they studied a painting of the mother of God.
As the results showed, believers were able to disable most of the pain.
By means of a brain scan technology, it could even be demonstrated that the Catholics could activate the part of their brain that is responsible for pain control.
The study was the first in a research project in which, alongside scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participated.
When trying, the volunteers were attached a sparkling device to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks off.
The participants were asked to focus strongly on two paintings: one image of the mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and another Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame with the Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the vision of the Virgin Mary among the believers would create a kind of religious trance, while they chose the image of Vinci, because it was hardly different from other paintings and felt soothing.
The subjects once spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, and at this time they received 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they should either look at the religious, or the other paintings.
The Catholics reported that when the mother of God was seen, they felt "in security" as if they were "uncared" and they felt "ruhe and peace".
While considering the religious painting, they reported more than 12% less pain than they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the attempt, said that similar effects could also be produced with other, strongly working images also with the atheists, one should only find the corresponding photo.
"We need to find a picture that causes very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," says the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and in many cases also do it," says Wright.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna image of Leonardos or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the believers.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You're what you're telling about yourself
On the occasion of their tenth birthday, Google can say with fug and right: it can be found in the pockets of people as well as over their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, to which specialists they go, and what they move.
And so still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's managing directors.
In the direction of skeptics plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he lets them align: these would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt recently said that the main goal of Google is to collect even more personal data about the users and thus to draw closer to the company's original goal, which means that she would like to "order all the information of this world".
Schmidt said that after ten years of changing work, Google was still at the beginning of the information collection.
Asked about the status Quo in five years, Schmidt said that he wished Google could answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "What job really fits me?" but software programs are not yet able to do so because they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet searches, the search terms would be registered, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the visited pages.
For example, the "Personalized Search", introduced two years ago, allows the visitor to store its own search history and to use it later so that the results can later be generated much more precisely, and the same logic is based on the so-called "Recommendations", with which the system recommends customized products and services due to the previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the case of data abuse - "When you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is rather the potential power represented by the company that makes fear exciting, and less the feeling of guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the desire to oppose the power that in many Internet users is opposing.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored but also passed on to third parties in the event, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
An example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, whereby Google sent information to the Brazilian government, collected by the Community site called "orkut", and allowed the pedophilia to be identified.
However, for personal rights concerned users could still breathe in May when Google successfully joined the Civil Rights Organization EFF against the FBI: Google can therefore not be forced to issue information to the FBI on a secret request in future with no point of the Constitution.
(On the other hand, the Federal Government has successfully produced the release of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms, referring to the youth protection law adopted in years ago, but it has been reserved the list of individual users, or their web and search term lists for two months.)
Google's image remains controversial: Those who disagree with their personal data because they fear the loss of their private and intimacy by using the Google services, the company crushes with the repulsion due to the conservatively representing companies.
However, the American "Geek culture" is present in many countries and enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users enter the next generation of the "cool entrepreneur" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is thanks to Windows market leader, even though both fight for the same goal.
A possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require any identification codes and provides its services for free so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be much more attractive, younger and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks look through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has been focused in particular in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
In the case of "Web 2.0", nothing else is about cooperation, say, users deliberately leave tracks and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are different individually, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
At the same time, an average youth can manage his profile on several community sports - from Facebook via Xanga, can connect it through other services such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can eventually integrate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. They can also run blogs that are automatically presenting the latest photo galleries designed on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other examples prove: When viewing the party photos of the last night, the friend will soon find out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee will be released, because in his blog he only makes all too honest his anger about the management of the company - one is sure: the term "private" has now been completely re interpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he gives of himself - in such a way one could formulate the basic idea behind the behaviour of today's youth.
And whoever tries to keep a little secret, or even to deal with the Google Monopol can do that - such as Scroogle, a tool that, although accessing the search engine of Google, does not deliberately leave any traces behind.
Not few people deliberately don't register on Community pages so that they can't be found, but also the online applications of Google, such as text processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be handled with alternative versions that are not bound to huge server parks and therefore not generate the best possible profile from the user.
However, public opinion waits banned for Google to show her true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords/AdSense's advertising area threatens the revenue of advertising agencies, and the ever faster introduced services not only create headbreaks of Microsoft but also other software developers.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: for example, the company management has completely rejected a protest of the employees after doubleing the fees of the company's own kindergarten, the management also meant that the number of catering the staff was too costly. However, all of this should be mild against the fact that Google went even to the knee in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement that all regimecritical hits, or those who violate the good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service will be proclaimed in advance, but only if it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could reverse a lot again: While some think that Google’s book and magazine scanning and archiving project now assumes that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather disturbed by the system "Health", which enables the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database, the next generation of Sci-Fi authors already delivers the substance - such as "Scroogled", the famous novel by Cory Doctorov describes a future in best orwell manner, in which a person becomes terribly close thanks to Google's data.
Two young people help the double killer of Ózd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police has now interrogated two young people who are suspicious to have helped to remove the traces, the speaker of the police commissioner Borsod informed on Tuesday.
The young people were consistent, at present they are accused of the aid.
According to information from the MTI news agency, it is two girls who defend themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a penalty of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
The man is under urgent deeds suspected of deliberately murdering several people from moneyishness.
In the course of the investigation, it has been found that the 23-year-old a 53-year-old owes a higher amount of money.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he locked his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he killed him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the action of a long hand - this also proves the fact that he has committed the murders with a gun hidden in the Tatort.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the weapon and the circumstances of their use.
Warschauer Stock Exchange offers purchase for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech Kronen, the Warsaw stock exchange offered for the 100 percent purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer offered by Poland despite the fact that they were previously excluded by the Czechs as possible owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw stock exchange belongs entirely to the state.
99% of the shares is in the hands of the Polish state, but more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily "E15", the offer of Poland includes the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have so far been offerings.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange last week said that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw stock exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not exclude that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts appreciate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange to 5-10 billion Kronen.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent participation, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments on the growing international financial crisis, some leading European leaves were already spoken on Tuesday of the "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe we owe to the U.S. President, for example, said "La Repubblica" - the President had not even been able to set up his own party for the draft law to bring some lighting into the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor", as the milliard heavy investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a "second 11 September".
Parts of the press in Madrid also ordered the sin-bock in Washington.
According to the El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is due to the fact that the world economy is now at the edge of the collapse.
The American financial system threatens to collapse more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote at the Congress, it threatens that Washington has no political means for crisis management.
The world economy depends in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger".
Even though some States could provide rescue packages to their money institutions, and save the banks with the money of taxpayers from bankruptcy.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and more banks are going to pee, there will be no further financial injections or other emergency measures.
In the long term, EU Member States would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control over money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid to weakening money institutions, the Viennaer recalls "The Standard". Furthermore, according to the newspaper, the concerns are increasingly realistic that after the Americans, the European taxpayers would need to take a little deeper into their pockets to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously addressed the crisis that is now fought like a tsunami over the old continents.
Although the "savior" would not have to "wed" with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable to note in what case it would be reasonable to include the money of taxpayers to counter an even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the Hummel
What would be the best method for developing new technologies for avoiding accidents if not imitating the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, the bees.
The CEATEC in Japan presented an amazing project that inspired the Nissan engineers of Hummeln in the creation of new accidents preventing systems.
In cooperation with the Tokyote University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetical system of type BR23C, a mini-auto equipped with the properties of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that prevents any collisions.
In the flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area", which is very similar to our own "protection shield", said Kazuhhiro Doi, Product Manager for Technology-PR and Research Development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in every direction and angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in it.
In order to imitate the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser controlled distance meter.
These identify obstacles before the BR23C in a 180-degree field within 2 meters, calculate their distances and send signals to the microprocessor to board, which immediately initiates the conflict prevention process.
The obstacle is registered in seconds breaking parts, and the authorobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tyres around the corresponding angle.
Unlike previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If not, the authorobot could not respond quickly enough to avoid the obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the Autorobot project.
The system must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and woundable part of the protective sign - a layer within which accidents are still considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect the behaviour of the bees when they avoid other bees.
And that must take place in the fraction of a second.
However, the falling, unlike the bees, cannot be up, down, or even diagonal - it can only be two-dimensional, in the direction of the viability of the tyres.
While the bees are infinitely open here to avoid other bees, the researchers at the authorobot were only able to use the movement, or the acceleration and brake.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries which are lighter and more energy-efficient and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it comes to the instinctive, intelligent reaction, and less to the processing of the data, and even less to the ability to store it.
This device must only process some inputs per second and respond accordingly to them.
It doesn't have to save them, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of former maneuver, so it is on the run just a handful of KB Memory.
There is no Gigabyte and megabyte memories needed.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan, will be seriesly in production within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately directing the driver around obstacles and thus leading it to the target.
A name for the sinister child
The written version of the 700-mrd dollar heavy savings package set is now available, which will be applied in several stages and aimed at purchasing the banks' bad loans.
In the first passage, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight east coast local time, the congress delegates went through after multi-day debates on an agreement on the $700 billion heavy rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, democratic president of the U.S. House of Deputies, and said that the agreement should only be brought to paper.
The compromise reached on the rescue package supported both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Financial Minister Henry Paulson said that the programme will show effect and it will be efficient, but it will have to do even more. According to Pelosi, it was not about the saving of Wall Street, but about breaking the rod of the economy.
The written version of the package was published before opening the Asian markets, i.e. Washingtoner Zeit Sunday evening 8 o'clock (mean-European time Monday 2 o'clock in the morning), but did not trigger a high-level flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday the House first voted on the draft law on the stabilisation of the economy from 2008 and then the Senate is on the line.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, and the White House also welcomed the news about the agreement.
We are satisfied with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, speaker of the White House.
The programme, however, deviates from the original recommendation of the Bush administration that the 700 billion dollars should be spent at once for the purchase of foolish securities under credit.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount will be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after the convention will be expected to vote on the Causa on Monday. This sum is intended to be used for the purchase of credit burdened, bad securities, and the other $100 billion will be decided by the President.
The programme is reviewed by a Commission of its own, who is also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision of the Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also apply a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgages-adhesive securities, or other "toxic" loans.
As responsible persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be done in auction as well as directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying resources, and the companies pay the corresponding fees to be expected.
Henry Paulsen said that the law defines the necessary resources so that up to $700 billion can be made available as an emergency aid to the American financial system, whether it is bad for the large-scale purchase of money, its insurance, or the avoidance of a system risk triggered by the collapse of a larger money institution.
We take the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law as soon as it was signed, Paulson.
However, the heads of banks in difficulty and now dependent on state aid can expect to be cut off by the government in the Overseas Snake Salopp "Golden Handshake".
A reduction of salaries will only exist in certain cases, and these reductions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps each.
The reduction essentially means that if the Ministry purchases within an auction, the "Gold Handshake" is taxed unless the sent banking chief is pushed off into the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of foolish loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that managers are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake treaties are not changed - the restrictions refer only to new agreements, so that more people participate in the programme.
This is the first case in American history that reductions in managerial salaries are regulated by law, commented the democrat Barney Frank, Chairman of the Financial Committee, on the measure.
The State gains participation rights to the participating banks, which reduces the risk for taxpayers, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the saved bank is getting better.
The draft law provides that the President will have to submit a proposal to the Congress in the next five years on how taxpayers should return their lost money from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts regarding the plan.
That is not what the American citizens expect of us, the plan does not protect the money of taxpayers, according to the California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

No more visa in the USA from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good opportunities for the American-Hungary Visa Agreement to enter into force around the 12th January, as the Foreign Minister explained before the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
They believe that "all depends now only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is being introduced in time in overseas."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but the tourists should register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy has been negotiating in Washington from now on.
She meets Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will send her the "Middle Merit Cross with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also talks with the foreign policy consultants of the Democrat Barack Obama and the Republican Presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support savings package for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, promised their support for the $700 billion saving package for banks on Sunday, but there are also politicians calling for the withdrawal of the Minister of Finance.
The Congress and Representatives of the Government announced that they agreed on the Banking Rescue Package on Sunday morning after many days of marathon consultations.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the emergence of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better than the respective opponent to lead the country from the economic crisis.
After recent surveys, Obama was able to further expand his advance thanks to the economic themes, while McCain's High, which gave him the presentation of Vice-President Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, was simultaneously melted away.
At a election event in Detroit on Sunday Obama expressed his hope that the Congress would quickly accept the Law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the plan also includes the passages of consumer protection that he supported.
"We have to act now, and that is responsible... - your jobs, your savings, whole industries, and the stability of the whole economy are threatened" - he said before 35,000 viewers.
He did not fail to call McCain's economic visions "obsolet".
In an interview given to the sender ABC, McCain said: "There is no alternative that we will all have difficult to kick (...) but nothing is.
The Republican Senator said that the plan also proposes the establishment of a control commission for the Minister of Finance, as well as the restriction of the finishes for top managers - something that he had insisted on.
Obama said to the CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, but he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, the speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, informed that the House of Deputies will probably vote on the draft law on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking room
The right camp is intact, only the voters were more self-conscious within the camp - so "The mirror" commented on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria Haider and Co are ready to rule to prevent a red-black coalition.
The mirror (Mirror.de)
In the online edition of the German newsmagazin on the left, Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber-Duo took over his office.
The Christian Socialists have renewed Bavaria over decades - now the modern citizens turn away from them.
At the same time, the breaking of the epoch is a problem of Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the CSU disaster did not come to an end, but on Sunday something ended, which was quite precisely ten years ago: the doubtless hegemony of a state party
For ten years ago, 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent and thus fell first under the 50 percent brand since the 1950s
This has been repeated three years ago in the Bundestagswahlen 2005, i.e. in the many Stoiber-Ära quoted.
The continual modernization operated by the CSU in the state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but they estimated significantly at the pace. However, without the effects of secularization, the education success, the entry of East and North Germans to the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain faithful to the CSU counters.
Modernisation is always part of an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and more autonomous.
It is noteworthy that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups have expressed the largest distance to the CSU: the free professions, the commercial citizenship and voters with abitur such as a university degree.
Here the support of the CSU decreased to even below 40 percent.
The press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily reports in her "Who with whom? Party chefs restrained in coalition issues" titled articles on the chaotic internal political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to set themselves in relation to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything is about the coalition; in the debates on public-law television, the leaders of the party hardly let their cards look.
SPÖ-Chef Werner Faymann reaffirmed his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very well possible - in some federal states and in the social society this is already the case.
The question whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP chief as Vice Chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, the voters would have elected the Schüssel-Molterer-Curse.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
However, Molterer has responded cautiously to red offers.
Cooperation could not be fruitful, he said when Faymann tried to interfere with the internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party is in opposition, or goes into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed ÖVP-intern.
BZÖ-Chef Jörg Haider showed itself open in all directions.
"To prevent red-black, we are willing to take over government responsibility," said Haider.
Járóka: The devil circle of poverty and segregation must be broken through
Today, in Paris, the European Summit of Equal Opportunities has begun to be addressed today by the European Council Presidentship of France.
In its speech addressed to the plenary, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz-Deputy of the European People's Party, pointed out in particular to the education group, since it is one of the most serious infringements of law that contradicts Roma children, and this is also the greatest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by the French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, Xavier Bertrand, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz MEPs, Járóka pointed out that in addition to discrimination in job searching, Roma would be displaced primarily because of their low level of education from the labour market.
"The majority of Roma youths have no secondary education and, thanks to poor primary education, only a small part of them can reach a university degree."
Furthermore, Járóka stressed that education is a fundamental human right that will play a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investments in early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU Member States.
The MEPs believe that it is important that these relationships become aware of a widest possible circle, namely Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma student starts the school, the more its chances to become a productive member of the labour market are increasing; and through income and turnover tax, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As citizens of the Union, Roma must be guaranteed the right to high-quality education - the bad and segregated education needs to be stopped" - says Lívia Járóka.
As the MEPs explained, a common, targeted and negotiated approach of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the deregulation process in the education sector, which is essential to correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We need to break through the devil circle from poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as fully-authorised citizens," Járóka asked.
Since the Berlin Congress last year, the summit has been organized annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the provision of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European and national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
CSU: Grace at Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen Duos Huber-Beckstein is decided
Despite the election decay, no heads are still rolling, at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the staff debates were postponed.
The party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in their offices, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent voting loss is decided on the last October weekend on the extraordinary party day.
But the much shattered duo already made it look that it doesn't want to stick on her armchairs.
In this way they want to seize the angry group and the party base, which demanded a day after the "Bayerian tsunami" in view of the loss of the absolute majority of personal consequences.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at his career peak - the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent. But now, one year after the Putsch against Stoiber, they could only secure 43.4 percent of the votes.
The CSU was for 46 years "only-regulators" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of the German GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the decisive force in the southern country, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As the first sign of the internal restructuring of the party, the potential successor of Hubers, Vice-President and Bundesagrarminister Horst Seehofer will also be included in the exploration team, which leads to the liberal FDP, or the legally judged "free voters" exploratory talks about a possible Munich coalition.
One irony of fate is that with the list of free voters, Gabriele Pauli came into the law, whose anti-stoiber appearance first utilized the Huber-Beckstein Duo to serve the targeted politician gracelessly.
The CSU leadership now concentrates all its forces on the stabilization of Becksteins.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who so far removed the threads, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU Chairman called the 28th September "the bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few toxic comments towards CDU - he believed the CSU would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed much to success at national level in 2005, should not be put back on the legs with a joint force act, Merkel cannot become Chancellor after the Bundestagswahlen in September 2009.
Merkel, who hasn't made a heal from their disappointment about the Fiasko, believes that the CSU's terrain loss will not negatively affect the great coalition in Berlin.
However, what is relatively relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to rule, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD has achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukaschenko-Opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no opposition MEP made it to the Ukrainian Parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is the prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukaschenko, but the OECD suspects that there are legal mismatches in the counting of the votes.
The OECD, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognised the elections.
Although the legislation of the 10-million-inhabitant country has come out for decades without opposition. Nevertheless, the counterparty gathered under the name "Unified Democratic Forces" (ODS) before yesterday's elections has earnestly hoped that Lukechenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional change in 2006, would "lease" some of the opposition members in Parliament.
That is why the ODS has even distanced from the previously planned boykottes.
Due to the increasing prices of natural gas imports from Russia, Ukraine is becoming more and more dependent. In order to improve the price increases, the country has also agreed to the Russians to sell the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading by the country. Due to the expectations of the opposition, the hope was that Ukraine would want to improve its relationship with the EU after Lukechenko and other high-ranking politicians have banned the EU's anti-democrat political system.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the deficiencies, such as the elimination of a third of the opposition candidates of the elections, provided for temporary relaxation.
However, on Monday the OECD's rapid report criticized the campaign - that is, opposer should not be present in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present when the votes were counted.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to recognize a improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been put on free foot, and Minsk is even ready for smaller confrontations with Moscow by continuing to recognise the independence of the abtrinsic Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhasia, although Russia, with which Ukraine is forming a federal state that has been regarded as independent for a month.
"We have made two steps forward and a backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinkewitsch to our leaf.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to leave only one oppositional to Parliament".
The opposition does not plan protest measures in view of the results, but rather seeks to clarify the need for economic reform to voters.
"We have to fight with many problems here - the opposition newspapers must be printed in Russia, the local authorities put us in the way of distribution stones, but yet I see that more and more people support change, even the older," said Milinkewitsch, in anticipating that not even the most-supported shift of pensioners agrees with the Lukaschenko regime, whose only earnings are the production of social security.
"Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the increase in the trade deficit, it is just a matter of time until the "social security" which is called to the silence of a cemetery begins to drift," says Milinkewitsch.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers referred to the elections as democratic.
Sergej Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, said the news agency Ria Novosti: "The people believe the deeds, and not the words". The lack of opposition is therefore a proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now it's being frozen before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi there are rotable doors for the entry and exits of officials.
From today onwards, the measure will enter into force against those Schlaumeier who first stamp off and then go to coffee drinks during working time.
The new 'Anti Faulpelz Act' was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister for Public Administration and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers.
">"Throwable doors are a means of increasing labour efficiency through a higher presence rate and more services," says Minister Brunetta.
"Now a new era of responsibility and transparency begins.
This is reformism," underlines Brunetta again.
With the Palazzo Chigi, the establishment ends in all the presidium buildings of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of spinable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the Secretary-General assured: "This process was supported by all, the cooperation came from all sides."
So all in all there is no more breakfast during working time; end with coffee or Croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works miracles."
During a meeting of the Supreme Committee of the Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
from Rome, the Minister announces that "in three months the absence of officials has reduced to 50%, that is, 60,000 people are more present at work a year".
It adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"Their wage dynamics - so the minister - have been twice as big in the last 8-10 years as the private sector and far above the inflation rate."
In the meantime, thousands of officials have gathered together to counteract the Brunetta Decree in the context of the call supported by Codacon.
"While the Minister for Public Service profiles with figures about lower dimensions in work - according to the Consumer Centre - the people of the 'active fauls' grow uninterrupted.
Indeed, thousands of correct and valuable officials of the public service have gathered together to explain the war to the decree's unlawful standards."
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fought for additional financial compensation for work-related diseases; the planned extension of the compulsory house arrest of the sick worker, during which check visits can be made and other aspects of the minister's innovations are also being challenged.
Napolitano: "Prevention against occupational accidents is crucial"
Every day 2500 accidents occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain lifelong invalids.
For 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents in work were about 1200.
These figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes nearly twice as many deaths as caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will take the 58th national day for the victims of occupational accidents so that the social institutions and media will pay attention to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data spread by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial issue of prevention in the workplace," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione national mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Merchandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "great appreciation for the constant commitment to the prevention of jobs, to the protection of injured workers, to support the families of victims and to the awareness of public opinion".
"A angry "Basta" has risen on this; understandable to tragedy, which, measured by its size, causes some incitement in the media and the participation of the public. However, the everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "in any case there is also a resource problem: there must be crucial investment in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for more direct consciousness in school frameworks of young people who nourish the working world are particularly important.
It is our duty to focus on this phenomenon and not distract from its social severity. We need to implement and improve a legislative standard.
On the other hand, the President of the Board of Gianfranco Fini emphasized "as the phenomenon of the work-related deaths constitutes an urgent social emergency which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work on decisive rules aiming to put an end to the problem".
"The data of work accidents seems to be a slight improvement, but this does not exclude that the number of work-related deaths is much too high," said President Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy at the end."
"How do you believe that you are basically doing too little to address the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
We believe that stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to inform the workers who already start at school".
"An additional effort is needed - so he adds - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But, above all, a greater sense of responsibility is demanded by employers' sides for a phenomenon which represents a social emergency."
Merchandelli also spoke about "the progressive deterioration of the protection of the accident victims of work" and called on the "abolition of the social system, which we have struggling against in recent years".
"The aim is, therefore, to give the worker a guarantee on insurance so that the fate of the victim of a work accident is not dependent on voluntary or random donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator."
Mp3 player under charge: risk of hearing damage
Sound music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as Mp3 player, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission quotes in a report published today in Brussels the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks) of the EU.
"The report – it is said in a note – makes it clear that 5-10% of those who hear loud music with portable musical devices for at least five years for a week longer than an hour a day, risk the lasting loss of their hearing."
"I am worried that such a large number of young people who usually put portable musical devices and mobile phones on a high volume, damage their hearing without knowing it irrelevantly," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings – it is said by the Eu – show a clear risk that impels to act too quickly.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make these information common.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent Scientific Committee in view of the widespread use of portable musical devices among young people.
"The scientists - so closes the EU Communication - confirm that you are too concerned and that the European Commission will now examine the necessary measures together with the other EU members and those affected to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable musical devices and similar devices."
There is already a European standard at the moment which limits the level of noise from portable musical devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damages that could come from too large noise loads.
One can very restrict these damages, in which one can take to solutions such as the reduction of volume and length of sound.
In their report, the Scientific Committee of the European Communities pointed out that if users of portable musical devices hear only five hours a week (laugher than 89 decibels) music, the legal limits already exceeded, which apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who cross this limit risk the complete loss of the hearing within five years.
This means that 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated to be between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, we're supposed to be over in March, we'll get a balance in June.
This is the process set by Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome". The Commission has met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla themes.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project will be completed, the City and the Municipal Council will assess the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and the Supreme Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," Alemanno stresses. "It will present proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political representatives remain in the city and municipal council.
There is no redistribution of powers, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
The task will be completed in March, and the Commission will resolve, as such a project must have a timely endpoint.
In June - as the Mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence, because their opinion on liability is lacking, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Politics are too often concerned with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time to work seriously with the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The Mayor of Rome puts much value on clarifying "This Commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a cent and it will bring us to reflection. It will employ the best heads of the capital."
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetical nor static to enable our city a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to do a common step in the future".
A future, according to Rome's Mayor, which "limits itself not only in the current local borders but will look much further", not only as regards the role of Rome as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's a statement
A well-known American politician, who is much about being regarded as independent, wrote: "Barack Obama becomes the second anti-american president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated by his decisions, the economy of the USA, and who had relations with hostile Islam (and still does this as a private man today).
The attacks against Obama are becoming more and more intense, right now, where the elections approach.
A lady from Miami wrote in a web page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very foolish: he thinks he will receive the highest office of a nation that has seen two black governors and five black senators in total!"
In fact, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are also the surveys; all say that Obama will win with a great advance.
Also in this case there are people who talk to the heart and not to their heads.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in her editorial: only in the election cabin will we know who the true American patriot will give his voice.
Here a mentality of the US appears, which was kept hidden until the last time.
"Say what you want, then we will decide for whom we will make our creuches, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now where the success of the black candidate seems so safe.
In all cases, despite all these considerations, the definitive weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: What mistake did Bush make during his term of office? 89% replied: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent back home with a stroll in the back.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority of Bush's weakness.
The one who will take his place is faced with a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its marks with journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts, and many accuse the Internet, the "mouse" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were asked by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern to the information relating to the delegates because of the general credibility.
They don't feel as alone as before.
The problem for the American journalists is the money.
The 2008 crisis is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, the major problems arise by the newsroom reductions, i.e. the space in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
It is a problem that needs to be solved – so the interviewed journalists – if one wants to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, from significantly shrinking.
A clear but complicated pessimism today fulfills the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalistism is on the wrong path at national level.
In the local area, the executives are even 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for the journalists to imagine the direction in which the web goes.
The main publishing groups run the way to the Internet, which is seen by many as the "killer" of the press.
The "economic pressure", which the journalists feel, has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology in the hope of "they bring something good for journalistism".
The largest rice in American journalism today exists between the newsroom editors and the reporters who work for them.
56% of the chefs at national level are sure, their reporters share their values with them, while they are only 23% at local level.
Some think it has to do with the "security in work".
The managers who are afraid to lose their work within three years are 47% at national level.
In the case of journalists, there are 30%.
The theme of "safe work" in the team (our "redactors", Anm. d. Red.) is always a current topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists are working under contract.
In a huge nation, as it are the USA, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV broadcasters and Internet operators, the employers like it will offer them and so it will take it or leave it.
The chief actors get very often very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, including pension and insurance fees.
As for the holiday, the matter is complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third to finally reach 15 holidays after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, as they admit themselves, are often "sick" during the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: JOURNAL IN THE ROM: DANILO COPPOLA BLEIBT IN GROTTAFERRA
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is determined against Coppola as a result of bankruptcy in the context of the investigation on the counter-compliance in the case of acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
During the process against him during the last week, his release from the house arrest was transformed into a duty to stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked the real estate agent to be moved from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the Court, such relocations (who the prosecutor had spoken against) could give him the opportunity to influence his society and to obtain evidence that he was accusing.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon had been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the White House's $700 billion package: one large part of the Americans was and is more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This confirms the last edition of the New York Times, which reports about how the crisis in the course of the republican party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favoured the state institutions and the business community and that neoconservative, which is hostile to "the one in Washington" and the financial world, and v.a. wins in the south and center of the states of voters.
This part of the party owes its rise v.a. the voice of the one I mentioned above.
However, this example mentioned above is only a small part of the major changes that announce or even represent the current economic earthquake: not only in the USA, even throughout the West and perhaps above, will be affected by them.
Both in the States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the long-feared events that finally take shape and come to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close links with the abroad and at the same time manage an enormous amount of the assets of households living in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for the governments, namely how to deal with the families concerned, which is also a huge voter mass.
The crisis appears to be economically global, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have been in a turn away and has lost its right of speech: the clear evidence of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division in various national and international conflicts, cannot find a common way.
Therefore, all now expect the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and e.g. distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis has become more and more serious, only the USA have been rescued in the economic situation without foreign aid.
In addition to the funds, they also have the legitimacy to use them: therefore, two non-experienced conditions – under certain circumstances – on which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to re-establish in a similar way.
This new emphasis, which is placed on the national national element, is also perfectly in line with the ever greater importance which is recently associated in the economy with a most closely related sector: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is right now, when we were so convinced that we had long entered into a networked realm, into a realm of ever differentiated technologies, the immaterial that we have to see at once how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although they can certainly all be transported from one place to the other of the world, they are connected to an extremely narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such a territory is in favour of another who lives in an harvestless, waterless or oil-free area.
I am now coming to the second novelty, which requires a short drift.
Anyone who says politics is also the leadership of the territory.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, there is knowledge about the need for respected leaderships, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of disarmament over the existing leaderships, e.g. those of the economy, which have escaped as inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and in some sense even more disturbing aspect: a loss of confidence, an indulgence, an image of impurity, a feeling of distance, all of which focuses on a whole class of managers of the western countries.
It seems so that the conviction among large parts of the population leads the way that it is not only the acts of the social elite, but already its idea world, their Way of Life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is the majority being more and more strange and surpassing.
The demand for Leadership thus nourishes underground a tangible but powerful movement of the dismantling of the leading class and the traditional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the immediate revival of the collective state of the past: starting with the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, about the collapse of the Labour Party in Britain, to the rebellion of American MEPs against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the rights in Italy plays here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value regarding what is happening today in the lower social layers of the West and is being strengthened by the financial crisis and driven to overdimension.
In view of all of this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping the eyes far open is certainly not.
The super sticker that lets up on walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to a adhesive and can climb walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centres, one of which seems to have reached almost the target.
With an adhesive placed on a surface of only 2.5 sqm, the researchers have managed to fix a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American magazine has published the results of researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon naor tubes.
"The principle of adhesive can be imagined as a series of spaghetti-arranged tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic harps that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with different materials such as glass Teflon and sleeve paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the retention of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "remove easily from the wall," says Liming Dai, researchers at the University of Dayton's Engineering Sciences.
AN MAUERN ENTLANGWANDERN? "This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Somehow like Spiderman gets up on walls? Maybe it is, but the researchers think more of a less fascinating advantage, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanor tubes are also heads of heat and electricity.
Other areas of application could fall within the area of space.
So for the moment the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER ART OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the calories present an adhesive of microfibres that, like hair, clean themselves from dust by movement on a surface and thus always maintain perfect liability.
Medicines: Never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks that are consumed due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, for example in summer, can cause serious health damage if they are taken with certain vital medications, as they can have an extreme effect on taking them through the body.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packed and fresh fruit juices in combination with medication. As part of the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he repeatedly alarmed: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is sufficient to reduce the acceptability of certain vital medicines so that they are practically eliminated and thus the health of patients.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some medicines such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular medicines, anxiolytic and neurologic agents to toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTS IN FAHR – The same agency of the medicine had warned doctors and patients two years ago against the dangers of this mix, and stressed that what is being drunk in connection with such medicines as diazepan or metadon.
IT IS NOT TO GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice contain substances that can inhibit medicines.
The list of active substances inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal by Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "These results are usually forwarded immediately to the various international manufacturers who are so free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to read the package leaflet always and, if uncertainties exist, not to ask a pharmacist or doctor", the expert of the Ansa agency stresses.
Economic Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The economic nobel price is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neokeynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest critics of Bush's economic and external policies.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman claimed that this second event was more crucial to the history of the USA than the attacks.
A prediction that has not been received as an answer to polemics and was held to the economist years later, but has proved to be completely correct today.
"I am surprised and also shocked about how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from the public view," Krugman explained at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "economy of great value", but also a banalist with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush Government."
Open Office, it appears the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The date of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the Open Source Software wins an increasingly large number of users, both at home and in the office, both in the freelance and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself to the audience with a few novelties: next to a revised and now more economically designed starting menu, there is finally a basicly guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x, as well as support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Attention was also given to the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Interesting are also some new features, such as those that allow to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which e.g. facilitates sending via email. This includes the possibility of importing PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time maintaining the original appearance of the page.
So you can also generate "hybride" PDF files that extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format to the elements of a table and a text processing system.
Cooperation is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be processed multi-handed by different users, preventing conflicts when changes are made; in the case of the text processing system, each processor is assigned a Frabe to ensure a better correction procedure.
Some companies are about to publish different functions of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result will be published in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available on the following link for download: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version that has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for Linux operating system.
On request you can send the installation CD to your home or to the office.
However, freedom of charge can be an incentive for the dissemination of the programme in private households, it is also in the field of business where OpenOffice could succeed the great throw: at last, various public administration and schools have already passed over to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a training offer, which means optimal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding text creation program; Calc, the table program aimed at dispersing Excel; Impress, for creating presentations such as with Powerpoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of more known access; and last Draw, a graphic module.
The target for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded in the case of 3 million and 600 thousand already.
Also tested Kohl positively and thus the fourth doping case
It opens a new Doping Fall mi Framework of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the Gerolsteiner team, who is a third-classified and winner of the best climber's tricot.
The message published the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from the Gerolsteiner team is the fourth driver who has been tested positively on Cera, the third-generation Epo. This was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and Stefan Schumacher.
The analysis from the blood samples of Kohl belongs to those performed in the last weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter samples confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be excluded from the race for two years.
The head of the French Antidoping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive Epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, notify the Austrian representatives.
The 26-year-old Austrian rose to the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the tricot of the best climber for himself.
THEMA INSTRUCTION: THE NEW YORK TIMES FRAGS: IS ITALY RASSISIC?
Italy, "the single country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only taken up with refusal.
Do this from the Belgian nation of racists? This is the question of the New York Times in a long article dedicated to the subject of racism in Italy and of the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he had claused a pack of cookies.
The case is evidence of what the Times describes as "paradox of the north": the northern regions are those in which "most integration and work opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigrationist sentiments and the greatest support of the Lega North".
As a confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times is calling for further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and for the faster interpretation of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement, which also underlines the Pope and the President: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between Church and State to combat racism."
Students victims of up to 900-Euro per room high rental prices
The market for apartments for students does not know any crises.
According to the last study of the Sunia, the tenant company, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken very serious trains. All of the students lose their right to study, as their families are not able to support them at this level" – says Sunia, Laura Mariani, "in these cities, the great demand from the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also damaged the other inhabitants.
In addition, most of the rental offers include a number of infringements: free contracts, missing registrations, without lease limit, unauthorized rents.
For the Sunia, there is the need for exceptional measures that result in a revision of taxation to lower rental prices.
More detailed consideration of the investigation shows that in Milan a bedplace in Brianza is needed about 450 Euros; one single room starts at 650 Euros (in the band Nere quarter) and ends with 800 Euros in the district of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 Euros in the Vittoria district.
In Florence an average sleeping space costs 350/400 Euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the quarters around the university, is 250/280 euros for a bedplace of needs, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the quarters around the university are approximately 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only a little deeper are the rents in the quarters around the other universities of Rome: 550 Euros in eastern Italy and Cinecittà.
Only those who deviate in foreign districts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping area and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping area, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a sleeping place costs 250-350 Euros, one single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to foreign students is more common, such as Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a 25-30% rent is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historical cinema closes due to the favoured multiplexkinos.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture of director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of the cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multisale complex in periphery, in the long run means death for the insaal cinema in the center. A process that appears not only inevitable and irrevocable but also carries the trains of a cultural crime.
It is mostly affected by historical places full of memories, "it is like a friend to lose with which one has laid a piece of street full of emotions," says the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso", who brought him the Oskar and the great price of Cannes. It is the history of a pre-city kinus and its nostalgic, which consists of living in a probably forever lost cinema world.
The figures that the Anec, the central commercial association, delivers speak a clear language: in the last five years, the vast amount of 316 traditional cinemas has had to be closed; most of these have paid the cinemas in the large cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
One of the most affected regions is the Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main guilty are the multiplexkinos, because they are just these three regions where the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: at 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy has the lists, 81 are both in Tuscany and in the Emilia Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," said Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also arise, but the preservation of the already existing, because a hall in the city closes, not all its clients are ready to visit a multiplexkino in the periphery instead of the old.
And here remains the missing budget for the Fond of the Commercial Association: the debt burden recorded by the State amounts to about 10 million euros.
It is a shame of the ethical and moral view that the government does not observe existing laws.
In order to preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros would be in the year of need."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, due to the fears of the old cinema halls, decided to protect them by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of this kind in Italy that aims to protect and support the traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the planned measures are tax advances for the cinema drivers as well as benefits for the public in terms of public transport: it will be allowed to go into the transport restricted areas of the centre and also to park more favourable parking fees.
"It is a delightful initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also develop new concepts.
But surely we also need a better audio and video equipment to be able to align something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of the traditional cinema has always been an important theme for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the crucial point that led me to set up the "Nuovo cinema paradiso" even though I had played with the thought for ten years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side to avoid seeing the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the lawyer of the Antimafia authorities of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his alternate Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, arrested this morning for processing in Mafia stores, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older intermediary between the clan and the public administration, as well as the cousin: the lawyer who has the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced to a sum of 10 million euros at the time for processing in criminal associations of the Mafia.
"Every kind of moral and legal norm disregarding," the lawyers wrote, "the two local administrations decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for consultative activities."
"The mafia group was thus made possible – according to the judges – to enter the councils officially and to participate in the public administration policy."
The President of the Regional Committee on Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not agree that in its region it is "all other than an exception to violate connections between local administrations and organised crimes." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who receive a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to the police of the Clan Piromalli, they were deprived.
Since the end of April the municipal council had been dissolved by Gioia Tauro, but the local politicians of their municipal offices had already been exposed in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged connections between organized crime and local administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected as head of the middle-right coalition after the election of May 2006.
He called Scandal when the prefecture ordered the resolution of the municipal council.
He was interested in the Vice-Minister Marco Minniti, whom he claimed to have invented everything for political and strategic reasons. However, the judges, in connection with the arrest warrant of this morning, explain that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request an amendment to the A3 project.
A hearing action related to the Dal Torrione case has shown the willingness to meet the desires of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – making the actions of the public administration identical to the interests of this clan."
When the energy escapes from the waves, the greats suddenly run up
It is an unchanging source of money, which covers over 70% of the planet's surface and seems to understand only now the world's major energy companies.
Wells, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that all look at now, and also seek to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of gaining energy from the sea movements has been considered and examined for 70 years; these studies have not accidentally intensified significantly since the first oil crisis.
As the price of oil broke in around 1980, the idea of marine energy is gasped, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new impulses in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the global energy needs could be covered by the energy generated by the ocean waves.
This would be equal to the double of the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, the currents and tides were also coming.
Giants in attack.
The first company that now sets on marine energy is Enersis, who signed a contract for the establishment of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this message was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry, which focus on marine energy production.
"Chevron investigates these technologies" – the speaker of a company known to the US giant in the Wall Street Journal – and considers the possibility to cooperate with us."
This concerns the acquisition of an authorisation by the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to launch a project before the coast of Alaska.
This is a not to be underestimated sign, e.g. when one considers that oil is continued by the US in Alaska and President Bush has recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; the details are not known, but observers speak of an increasing interest.
Enhanced technologies.
Experts speak of a technology still in the burst, which is not last because the last doubts of the environmental protectionists have not yet been clarified.
To date, projects such as those in Portugal and also Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious environmental problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with far greater impact on the environment need to be produced.
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power uses a system of connected bows.
The swim of the waves, which moves the bows up and down, is transformed into hydraulic pressure through pistons and cylinders within the swimmer.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The current is then sent via underwater lines to the coast.
To date, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for state approval. Some of the energy gained could also serve for military institutions.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a warehouse and a parklat with the help of underseas turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feed the generator by the resulting rotating movement.
According to Verdant, a long snake of possible clients already awaits the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute of Electricity Profiting Research, a particular interest deserves at present the potential that lies in the tides.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, tides are better predictable than wind currents, sun radiation and waves, and therefore a more reliable source of power.
Especially the tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska and other coastal states have already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
