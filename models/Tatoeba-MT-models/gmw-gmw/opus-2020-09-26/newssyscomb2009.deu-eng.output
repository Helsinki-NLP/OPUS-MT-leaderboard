Triumph of the legal populists in Austria, they totally reach 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous major coalition and a marked strengthening of the legal populist parties brought the preferred parliamentary elections from Sunday in Austria after the first provisional results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered particular losses, where the position of the former Chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the hip.
On the other hand, the elector of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to federal policy.
According to the previous results, social democracy (SPÖ) remains strongest with 29.8 percent of the votes in the country, but against the last elections in 2006 it loses 5.5 percent of the votes.
Even worse, the ÖVP cut off, which loses almost nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People's Party who had requested the preferred elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP was withdrawn from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advance in front of the SPÖ.
The voters, however, have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible withdrawal of the party president and previous Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observants believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party Board.
Such a development would probably lead to the most probable way out of the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both legal populistic parties - the Liberty (FPÖ) received provisionally 18 percent of the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed their fear that 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was still unified, in 2005 it split off from the BZÖ) with regard to a common government, which had even caused sanctions from the European Union.
On this development, Jörg Haider, who already declared that he was willing to cooperate with each party and goes from a return to Vienna into Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also moved to Parliament, which suffered light losses and borrowed from the third to the fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percent doorstep and therefore not moved into Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If it is not possible to solve the problem with the Czech scientists accused in India for the unlawful collection of beetles, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations could come.
This was stressed by the Minister in New York after the present meeting with his Indian colleague Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then surely, there is a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting taking place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions that in judicial matters the executive could only hardly intervene.
In spite of all, he suggested that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charge and received a fine that central government with the local government in Darjiling wants the case in which the case is jurisdiction.
"His problem could be resolved," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years of sentence of freedom, Mukherdshi's opinion would be the best if he went to appeal at a higher authority.
He could, in such a way, ask for the release of bail and, in freedom, wait for his judgment, the Minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also spoken in negotiations.
"He recommends a appeal at a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," said the Chief of Czech diplomacy.
The only way that the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convict "competent legal support", the Indian Minister stated.
At the same time, he said that such aid was already offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that," led Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, before his partner, he reaffirmed the Czech Republic with great importance to the problem of Czech enomologists.
"We really think it is a great mistake to detain and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received the promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the Minister evaporates.
"I've already been promised a lot," he just noted.
A Czech judges about ringing around the sea ground
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are drawn.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it also the adjacent sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself", says the Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty staff team of the UN District for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His head, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, pursues the interpretation and supplements it.
There is work elan and enthusiasm here.
The soil of the sea has a little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here you can find petroleum, the wider ore and other non-increasing raw materials, but also so far unknown living organisms, which, for example, bear the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A soil of the sea, greater than the mainland
Today, the anrainer states have reported their claim to the new sea zones.
After a UN Convention, they use their rights to which they agreed in Montego Bay in Jamaica in 1982.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental Shelfs, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has a exclusive right to all the sources of the continental Shelfs.
"Simplified, as a continental shelf, the part of the sea floor and its soles is considered, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It exceeds the borders of the shore, often also the border of two hundred miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the relevant country of the Commission to fix the external borders of the Continental Shelf must be demonstrated by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated more than five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the three last countries have been successful," adds Mikulka.
On an international echo recently the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the sea floor, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit that they will gain from the use of the sea floor in the future will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental Shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor, which is referred to by the Convention as "common heritage of mankind".
There's no state in this place.
The right to promote in this area confers an international institution established by the Convention.
"The sea floor, however, is not a gold graveland," says with some exaggeration director Mikulka and adds, "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Some of the sea floor belongs to the Czech Republic today.
She shares it with other countries of the former East Block within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It received the status of a so-called "bahnbreaking investor" in 1991 due to the Convention, as well as the investors of some less other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the quiet ocean between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the sea floor.
"Foods can be found there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich venue of polymetal contracts containing nickels, copper, cobalt and mangan", says another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian staff of the Rober Sandev Division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
She reminds of a little potato or, with a little imagination, the splendid shem that has raised the legend after the Golem to life.
German Special Forces were on site at hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the geiselkrise - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
European tourists who are kidnapped in Egypt are becoming more and more aware of the circumstances of liberation of eleven.
According to the Department of Defense and Interior, German Special Forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Federal Army as well as officials of the GSG 9 were the flyer stake of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal and logistics experts of the Technical Aid at the site of liberation.
However, as spokesmen of the ministries continued on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostages left their prisoners running and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany in order to integrate them as local support forces.
"Happyly, this has not happened," said a speaker from the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
Attackers had kidnapped the travel group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions in the south of Egypt on September 19th.
After the abduction in a desert area in the south of Egypt, the hostages had been dragged to and off in the border between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of hostages remained unclear until last as well as the details of the liberation or possible ransom payments.
The Gerettets have now arrived in Cairo well-maintained.
Steinmeier said that the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German message.
For details of the release, he did not express himself.
At first, there was no information in Berlin when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Image" newspaper, the five holidayers and the special forces are to be flew out with an airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US Representative House rejects rescue package
The first Chamber of the U.S. Congress has scarcely failed the $700 billion saving package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went to the depth.
By 206 votes to 227, the U.S. Representatives House rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme with which the chaos should be deteriorated to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the MEPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to get political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet occurred," he admitted.
During the vote, Dow Jones broke up by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reasons were concerns of investors that could fail the State rescue package.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming acquainted with the failure, to crash again.
Experts are now expecting further severe turbulences in the international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, both the House of MEPs and the Senate must be consented.
Organizers are rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German travelers:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ desire for travel remains unberühred according to a study.
During the winter season bookings, rice offices recorded a turnover of 31 percent compared to the previous year’s period, as the German Travel Association (DRV) notified in Berlin on Monday.
According to the investigation by the GfK market research institute, booking figures have already increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the turnover of travel agencies for October was about 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV notified.
The basis for these results are the figures of the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and is highly calculated for the whole market.
The travel bookings carried out by the end of August 2008 are included.
Due to the weak dollar course, travel to the USA was required, the DRV informed.
This amounts to approximately one third of the booking growth.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the local bills in the Germans are particularly demanded destinations.
In particular, break-off travels were high in the course, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Given rising costs for energy and food, the costs "be better calculatable for customers than for individually organized holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that, compared to the previous year, there would be a turnover increase - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first October festival
Ballermann-Apres-Ski hits in the endless loop, beer made of liters and promising in designer directors.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She's blonde, TV fashioner and wears a tailored Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: fewly three minutes on the Wiesn, the photographers are already crashing on us and cutting the memory cards full - very flattery and that at my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The Billig-Dirndl seems to be fulfilling its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the white-worm-equator, the well-being was restricted until the date.
But once arrived at the Theresiens, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears Dirndl or leatherhosn; no one looks rebelled or embarrassed - everything completely normal.
Funny views at the Chocobanan scene only harvest my dirndlschürze.
A Munich woman reminds me that I had wrongly bound the gun: "Links hoast free, middle virgin, right forgive, widowed back."
At home, I'm choking the loop from the back to the left.
"Pass," said it and laughed.
Others make less effort for subtle flirt techniques and wear simple filtry hats on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretches the naked back part against an unprecedented one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attractions is called Bob, comes from England and also attends the October festival for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-drawn "ooooo".
He's telling me that after he got rid of his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of these hydrogens, all think he's a trash.
So Bob is one of these infamous "Wildbieslers".
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At 8 o'clock in the evening, Sanitäter runs in crowds over the festivals that need to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the slide - every four at once sleep a covered wear of tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty, fully back.
Those who are in the promille barbecue under the plane are not seen.
"These are those where goarnimmer packs," one of the health careers called me on request and disappeared in the mud.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female walker who died in the hospital after she was driven by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon at Shenfield Road in the center of the city.
She was brought to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident because of suspicious driving.
Meanwhile, he was released on deposit.
Turkey expands the diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey was endeavored to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into the backland of Turkey.
On the east side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial desire.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits riding at the end of the railway platform with a tower at every corner of the front and looks like any provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building falls like
But once you are within the waved ticket switch, there is no doubt about the magnificentness of the project, whose western access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a rider in the imperialist game, had to implement before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Bagdad, and further beyond what is today Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany's imperialistic projects took advantage of during the first world war.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence by Arabia and its Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, produced by the insurmountable boundaries of the cold war, has disappeared.
British forces drove out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917 a munition train flew into the air, with the artificial roof being destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was Sabotage.
Since then it has been slowly broken, far from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to anatolia and all east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling judicial and development party, the ACP, has introduced a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of approach.
Remarkably, the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian Splitter Groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I went to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, Turkish Members of Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hollow ride on tracks that produced the equity of the old world in the well-known documentation "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new worldly state projects, to return to the Ottoman past.
However, the ACP, known for its Islamic roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity
This has caused a lot of suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi has brought me to the ACP headquarters, a specially manufactured, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-completed shopping centres and pebbles in which middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbouring countries.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today she has to look east and west at the same time.
There wouldn't be either the one or the other.
She'd have to do both of them.
"But certainly Turkey could sometime be forced to decide?" I asked.
"Turkey," he said, "wouldn't have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that nearly everyone with whom I was talking with here said routinely: Turkey's relations, not only the Middle East, but also the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are equally beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe as a whole can drive on the eastern tracks of Asia and Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpashas station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had been watching this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, too far, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the site for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least there seemed to be little doubt about which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (after call on September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus.
He was thought for young people up to 21 years, but when the choir last sang in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the willingness and ability of the chore to attack any musical piece that was presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young cheer was often astonishing, always thrilling, and stood only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never read over years.
How often death stopped us to "let the music speak for ourselves".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it sings!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never sheer but never excessive.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always called for an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I have written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by a single person - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He despised conductors who, according to his words, simply went home with one or two well-known actors in the world.
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "in 1946 he resumed the teaching of the economic history in Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman Research College ... while he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctorate at the same time.
This is a conclusion from a note of authors in Woodruff's book "Never side of Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during that period he wrote a doctoral work on the British rubber industry under the care of Professor J.D. Chambers, who was later published as the British rubber industry in 1958.
He was in 1950-1951 in the United States in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
He finally left Nottingham in 1953 and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to twist this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philological Faculty.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They made me attentive to them because of their simplicity and because of the strength that they emit, as they always deal with respect for the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows to find the magical moments."
Second round of excellent sale at Honda.
In November, Honda launches the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large-sized limousine is even more important.
There are also technical fines that allow even more comfortable driving and fuel savings.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aestheticly, the new jazz has a similar line with its predecessor, the changes made in this grandlimousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanism should be stressed.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you must say that this new jazz appears six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda renewed this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in relation to its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car in 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda tries to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars, which are 17% of the estimated growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002, which are 6.7% of the total sale at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branches in Spain expect to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More precisely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to twin the sales reduction in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to complete the year with total sales of 22 000 models. These are 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this sales growth, Honda increased its market share in Spain compared with the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
In order to reach this share, Honda sets on the appearance of a new model.
It is insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and compact size of 4.7 meters length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models per year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The entry of the Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with increasing dimensions, the interior is also increased.
This success is on the one hand the new space flexibility program and on the other hand, thanks to the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the suitcase room, which has a double charge area system, also reaches up to 339 litres, i.e. 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation suitcase room.
It must be stressed that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 litres gasoline engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz suitcase with a 1.2-liter petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, except for additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of building panoramic windows, improved access to seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The second generation of jazz engines are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have excellent technical performance with i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, while simultaneously delivers torque power for the whole engine run.
The first version of 1.2 litres achieves the performance of 90 hp at 6 000 rotations with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 PS - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 PS during the previous generation, it now creates 100 PS.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5.4 litres of petrol consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Auto-Biene' that avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of the technologies for accident prevention, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarming behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a biomimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s technical development centre have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of Technology-PR and R&D-Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sign.
This robot is intended to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see through an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which enables them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to reflect the roundum perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He observes obstacles that are located before the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are in the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a board-own microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal for avoiding collision
`In the moment when obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference to other systems is that this reversal manoeuvre takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it was not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the manager of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot vary up or down, but also not overlapping; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and infinitely as the bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act according to these information.
It does not require to store the information or the intuitive logic of the manoeuvres made, so it can continuously work with only a few dozen KB of the space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the disk space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology prophesied by Nissan in the next ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and keep longer than diversity of lithium ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system through satellite to lead to the target while driving and avoiding the obstacles on the way.
She's trembling before she's being burdened with a mortgage.
It must be acknowledged that the Ministry of Finance of the United States, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the involvement of the US citizens in mortgage stories of the supposedly payable banks, a entertaining and informative game for the Internet surfers was developed: 'Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the `hotel of bad loans' or of blending.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially his receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times, whether it's the moment not to ask for any credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a side for the teenagers than a place for all the audiences.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, with which this would be the first bank in Japan to spend the nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a renewal due to a strong case of their stock exchange course.
One week after a provisional agreement had been made public, the two banks explained that MUFG 9.9% of the Morgan Stanley stamp is going to buy at a uniform price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of $3 billion.
The accepted price is below 19% of the price of the share on 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be sold again at a price of 31,25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley explained that the global business will be done on the basis of a single average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley share decreased by 6.79% to $23.07 by 17.00 GMT.
`This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a Holding Bank', said John Mack, Director-General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley accepted this status last week, which would allow him to expand its business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the largest names of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The arrangements presented on Monday also show that during the last days the agreement was changed: Last Monday Morgan simply explained that it would sell up to 20% of its shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
'A week ago', explained in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, 'we thought that the participation would consist entirely of stem shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.'
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for their Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will take about 20% per share with a reduction of profit.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into stem shares in one year if the latter is exchanged over 50% above the sale value within a given period, i.e. to approximately EUR 47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will allow him to use investment opportunities, strengthen their balance and increase their sales.
However, a press speaker of the group refused to make more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
According to MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a rate of approximately 15% payment capacity, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained that he had reduced his balance since the end of August.
The last weeks were hard for the group, who had to see how her stock exchange rate fell by half, while the price of insurance against inability to pay speeded up.
This price returned on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other 'survivors' of the large investment banks at Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced to have canceled 15 billion dollars last week, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The republic around socialism of the 21st century refounded.
This is the joint project of the Venezolaner Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equator Rafael Correa.
The third party, following the example of his likes and friends this Sunday, set the plan for a new constitution.
Mission is fulfilled because according to the public results of 80% of the voters were `Yes' in the Volksabstimmung 64%.
According to these results, 28% voted with `Non', 7% of the voters were invalid and 0.7% were released empty.
In order to adopt the Constitutional Project, more than half of all votes cast must be reached.
On Sunday, two surveys carried out at the exits of the elections and a countdown of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for `Ja', and it prophesied 63% to 70%.
On the night from Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had requested the victory of his constitutional project.
The 'Constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way', he had insured and congratulated the Equators in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 km southwest of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by Michelle Bachelet, a Chile.
The choice held in silence in accordance with the Observatory of the Organization of the American States (OAS) refers to a 444-point text to secure the 'new socialism' for which the President is engaged.
The Constitutional Project transmits the state authority to the economy by leaving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives widely from petroleum production by foreign companies and from foreign exchanges, sending the immigrants to the country.
The project, which is driven by the 2006 chosen Correa, also confers more power to the Head of State, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he would use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also ensures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Finally, it also proposes to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorial support point as the starting station for American anti-drugs.
The 19 hostages were liberated in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, held in the desert for eleven days, were brought to the Egyptian capital healthy and unversed this Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were liberated from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military support point al-Maza directly next to the international airport of Cairo on board a special aircraft at 15.30 p.m.
They were brought directly, without being able to talk to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers were not paid a ransom', said the Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the Rollfeld.
After being captured on September 19 at a terrain-safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought to the next by 35 unknown kidnappers from one hide.
It is eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Agency Aegyptus, organisers of the Safari.
An Egyptian security officer explained that 30 members of the special units, from board two helicopters, started the attack at night, just before the dawn.
`On both sides shots fell and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this controller who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian specialities had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is right now, about the role, the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units.
`We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionality and performance of our men from the secret service and from the special units,' he explained without further details.
He also dismissed that a ransom had been paid.
The evening before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a terrain vehicle at a patrol in which the kidnappers were, six of which they killed, including the leaders of the Chad, and two arrests.
The army explained that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfour, but the Libération du Soudan-Unité movement (SLA-U), which immediately conflicted with this movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is headlines and is the central issue of the current campaign.
That's better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in forgottenness.
Who will rise and charge the indignant sums that are granted to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical places that desperately starve?
Which politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that protect our cultural heritage effectively?
Did you know that the French government only provides €3.5 million for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbours, it is written in the constitution of their country that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all Members and all government districts, in mutual voting.
In Quebec, in the Association of History Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 honourable officials who are gathered in 211 historical societies are striving to deal intensively with history, to save the numerous private archives with a few groves, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage that protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers let their bulldozers go on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial governmental approach, the Benelux States want to fall under the arms of the Belgian-Holland Fortis Bank, which is affected by the US financial crisis in Turbulenzen: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level on the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the representative of the European Commission’s Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions that are now being made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the Bank at about 49 percent.
The Bank is likely to sell part of its shares, all of them in advance of the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep valley trip last week, in the second half of the week, serious crisis scenarios were already recorded.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too big for a pile.
The securities of the institution fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year depth.
Since January, the value of the shares fell by more than two thirds.
In view of the current stock rates, the group's market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which according to management is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion American rescue package and the resulted insecurity in the markets are due to the traffic of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the courses increased slightly.
On Friday Filip Dierckx was appointed new Director-General of the Bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it has not found any interested person with a specific offer.
However, the Belgian government was trying to calm down - no investor is supposed to be trembling for his money, it said.
No panic has so far been broke out among the customers, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing firms its own.
Fuchs in the chicken pitch
Due to the drug consumption of a person, life and health insurance in America often refuses to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the medicine data to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust in the fox the chickens" - quoted by Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurances shall determine the fees and payouts in case of damage depending on the health condition of the customer, and should be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
Previously, the customer was sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the investigation results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a far more favourable method: using the customer's identification number, he refers to the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacists, talks what preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol lowering medicines, the result is that his blood fat level is untreated, which would automatically put him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some define even a risk multiplier, so that insurance only needs to do the paper cram more, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as migraine and heat walls, but also against depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the above is not mentioned.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed which, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for their consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, even though neglects have not been granted so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and combine them with the data about drug use, which provides a more precise picture of the health condition of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data and the control of their use becomes more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a private data protection law on health data, its effect only applies to healthcare providers and insurance services.
The draft law has already been submitted to the Congress, so that the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the data subject.
Another question is, of course, that the data subject may hardly prevent access to his data, since insurance does not otherwise conclude a contract with it.
And so the chickens are left somehow to the grace of the fox.
Global dining plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are both leading trading partners of each other, this was the main issue in addition to other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indies Summit is also taking place, mainly discussing cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more votes and voices in international matters, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether they should support the continuing membership of New Delhis in the UN Security Council or not.
This question was not discussed yesterday at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached that trade would be doubled over the next five years, i.e. increased to EUR 100 billion.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil flight agreements with India were also legally summarized into an agreement, so that air traffic will be also aviated in the future.
By 2009, India wishes to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the package.
The objective is to make a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union is the partner number one of India, Neu-Delhi is only on the nine side of the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned. The call for a UN conference was also urgized.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides being blamed for failure.
The EU stressed its commitment to its energy and climate programme, which means that pollutants emissions should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
This also agreed to India, as did the proposal to close a kind of global compromise at the next climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in prices in foodstuffs should also be combated, so both support the establishment of an international conference on financial crisis.
Today, the Indian Head of Government visits the French capital, where it will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, one hopes for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's notifications, the Agreement will be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th book fair, the most important international event for the right acquisition.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the present event. They will distribute over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
The secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Cultural Activity Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be the 264 sqm exhibition room "Punto Italia".
There will be a press conference near the Room Structure at the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, numbers, trends and perspectives are discussed around the publishing industry in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers in all, but in particular in the adult and youth savings.
The disappearing small aircraft of the billionary Steve Fossett found a year ago
Steve Fossett's small aircraft, which disappeared on September 3, 2007 on a flight over the Nevada Desert, was found.
The parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m height, in the area of Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completed the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been localized, and a troop has been sent out. Now we have the security that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionary was declared dead in February.
The American Transport Security Office (Ntsb) noted that a team was sent out a few hours after seeing the plane, which identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett in Yerington in Nevada started a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, some of the personal items of Fossett were also found in California, near the border to Nevada, by a couple near their home to the Mammoth Lakes.
It is two statements with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned for one month after its disappearance.
The billionary had conquered a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002, as the first person, he managed to circulate the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without an intermediate flight.
Among its many records is a 15445 m high-level flight over the Andes, but it is a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A Suv, which falls from the traditional schemes through its original design and the special line management, the recharging surface and its clear angle.
With this offroader Mercedes-Benz has tried to embrace new breath in the sector.
Especially because of its extraordinary properties, the suv Glk will be unconventional, which will be seen in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising junk that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in new dress, namely, in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in retrospective Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in different fibers, which will take the central shopping miles of Milan, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first fiber will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses that are distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster on which it is shown.
The Elumina8 technology of the new Glk will then be used to illuminate in all its details in different moments in order to reconstruct it as a whole.
Certainly, the concern of Mercedes with this advertising is to introduce a new type of author clam in this rather stereotype field.
But will it be able to travel the interest of the future buyers? We will see it.
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls who are ashamed of all of Italy now? They are part of the "Ultras Italia" group that has traveled after the Italian national team for years and, honestly, has not caused any serious problems until recently.
There has never been contradictions with opposing fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The supporters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
There were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They wear the Tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria there was now a collision with a truly right radical fanscene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans 144 cards for the game: all were exhibited on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among the people traveled to Sofia was no one with an ongoing stadium prohibition procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, which were already pre-loaded in this respect, were also refused the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stages throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put one foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now there is, of course, fear of imitation dead, which could follow little more than 150.
"This fire has to be triggered immediately, and that no such behaviour is the possibility of justifying," says the Viminal.
Therefore, "Especially with a view to the game of the national team in Lecce on Wednesday."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sport Supervisorio) meets on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the ais, i.e. the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce Calle and the elevated right arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly in no joy), which has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultra Italia founded in 2002.
It is true, says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but the behaviour of these 150-200 people was undoubtedly a shame.
"I am not a sociologist – adds the number 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are admired in the country of their deeds.
Until now, this group had been in the triumph, but now it has to be considered what has happened and will happen.
But we also talk about the peppers during the hymn Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but let me, there is lack of education...".
