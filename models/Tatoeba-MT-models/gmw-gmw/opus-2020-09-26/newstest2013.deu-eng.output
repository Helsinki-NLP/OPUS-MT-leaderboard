A Republican strategy to combat the re-election of Obama
The leaders of the Republicans justify their policy with the need to fight the election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by reaffirming that the fraud in the United States is rarer than the number of people killed by the flash.
By the way, the Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on elections.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US State is responsible for the implementation of the elections in each country.
In this sense, the majority of American governments have announced new laws since 2009, which have made it difficult to register or proceed.
This phenomenon has gained importance after the elections of November 2010, where 675 new Republican representatives could be registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 drafts of law were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of electoral law in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require the voters to provide a photo identification and evidence of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for the premature voting, declaring the right of invalidity to register as electors on the day of the election, and nationals agree with the right of election for which a court act is available.
Before the elections of 2006, no U.S. state has requested the voters to show a photo identification.
Indiana was the first state to raise such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hurried to extend this practice to other states.
During the last two years, they have promoted drafts of law in 34 state states, with which the voters are forced to show an image.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, the US citizens do not have a universal card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, that is, 21 million electoral persons do not have an image card issued by a government authority of their state.
In addition, five million new selectors do not have such an ID in 2012.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often paid to receive the necessary ID.
The new restrictions affect young people, minorities and low-income people disproportionately.
In fact, 25% of Afro Americans, 15% of people with a income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have the necessary photo identification.
This is still enough.
Students who are regarded as electors who are enlarged in their voices for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their image card issued by their establishment in several countries.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting associations to choose more for the Republican side to use the maps issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no state requested evidence of citizenship for the choice.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require the voters to prove their citizenship in the US.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting hisopathic votes.
For it is obvious that two out of three hisopathic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican legislators have promoted laws in eight states with which the registration of voters was abolished on the election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to those voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to the registration of voters in general elections in 2004 to register about 10 million citizens.
Because the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new selectors in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aimed at shortening the period for the premature voting.
For example, in the general elections in 2008 in Florida, 33% of the voters who had previously chosen were Afro Americans, although they were only 13% of the voters of the state.
The same applies to the historical population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the voters, but 24% of the citizens who had elected in advance.
On the other hand, the whites representing 76% of the voters accounted for only 46% of the voters who chose in advance.
Of course, the democratic legislators and their followers have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several drafts of law were blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The prosecutor-general of the United States has intervened to abolish the most controversial laws.
They could partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have adopted laws that require the presentation of an image.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of electoral law difficult.
Democracy critics contemplate the party policy nature of the laws adopted and see in them as a clear objective the influence of the results in the countries decisive for 2012.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that those states that have adopted these laws constitute 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral board to win the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these amendments to the legislation on the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the presidential elections in 2012.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on elections.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be performed or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows defective results, with false negative or false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a stronger hesitation of the men who have been unending to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have taken the opinion of two specialists.
In the U.S. studies, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study has also shown that if no early detection was performed, the probability of metastase formation is 30 to 40% higher.
That is why I recommend the test of 50 years or 40 years of age when one has a direct relative who has already suffered from prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of afro-American origin.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer has been detected.
There are types of cancer that are aggressive and others indolent.
The patient must be made truly understandable to the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options in which prostate cancer can remain untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases it is more likely to decide to monitor the disease actively.
Today, many men who have recognized cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not a threat to their lives.
They are proposed to be actively monitored and can be treated in the event of progression of the disease.
The criteria for a decision, which should be treated and who should not be determined with increasing accuracy.
That is why I still recommend the execution of the test.
But most importantly, it is to talk to his doctor to determine whether he should be carried out or not.
In cooperation with the international urology society, Movember has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress made in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancer may be prevented if everyone eats well and would move sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, this value would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson of the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, about 10% of cancer is assumed to be caused by inheritance.
Several remain completely unclear.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco dependency remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It severely damages human health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," regrets the speaker André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the absence of the cigarette, the risk of cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and adipositas also promote the outbreak of disease.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, grievous, mast intestinal, food tubes, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"The research shows that regular physical activity protects against grievous cancer throughout life," he adds.
The nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much, it increases the risk of disease of a mucous or mast cancer.
Worst products should also be avoided.
Conservation of meat by incense, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years several scientists have examined the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
However, your studies are currently not conclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, vitamin E studies are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction of the risk of prostate cancer, another showed more an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly shown.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family predisposition.
"The implementation of an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Boson analyzes
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Boson has excited some remarks in the last summer, and this for good reason.
Indeed, it is believed that this Boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence of the standard model - our best or "at least false" explanation of nature and behavior of matter - was foretold, but was not yet noticed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not completely sure that it is really the Higgs.
We know without doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it resembles the Higgs Boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a large physics conference in Kyoto, but there is no data left to be completely safe about it.
Yet, let's assume that it's actually the Higgs, as it seems that there's only a small risk of being deceived, and let's look at what's going on.
There is necessarily an indispensable law in this world that causes that two objects cannot be present simultaneously at the same place.
It is not possible to violate this rule - and do not try it too strong because you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to them: the Pauli's exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quent state", with this "condition" largely consists of some of their properties.
From this, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner are the good citizens who are called Fermione and likely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the Bosons, an evil band of anarchists who are nothing sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley laboratories (which is, by the way, absolutely amazing) these bosons are divided into two groups: the Mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and with whom the Higgs Boson would be related somehow.
But it must be stressed here that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, then only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "both" of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle accelerates with an electric charge or changes the direction, the electromagnetic field is "gesturped" exactly in this place, in such a way as a tombstone that was thrown into a pond.
This "destruction" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "drawers of power".
Stabler Field
The same applies to the Higgs Boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "gesturped" so that this Boson will appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must achieve very high energies, a little similar to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be frightened by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as the CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a size of 27 km! - to achieve such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, it is not all particles and all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others do not - for example, a paper would never keep itself at the refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the others (as by other means the photon) have no mass.
For what can all these research now be "good," asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM), and they also enable physicists to examine all deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
There are also numerous physicists who hope that such variations will be found, as the least difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stop some holes of the model.
One must say that the latter still has great deficiencies because it does not provide explanations for the gravity (ups!) and the dark matter that forms around 80% of the matter of the universe (new ups!).
However, such deviations have not been found in the CERN until now.
Effects
The impact of these research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there was no.
By the way, in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell labs did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but otherwise nothing.
In fact, the deceased physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs in which the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 himself developed the first long-term stroke laser (the first were pulsed) - said that at the beginning the laser was considered rather a "lab play".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle in 1969 developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor today serves all digital cameras worldwide as a "auge" and has introduced him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it means that you can really never know it...
Palliative Care - the best way to die...
With her Committee on "Death in Dearness", Quebec has recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be resumed soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that boasted him had left him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I've done seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in Beloull in his bed for Palliative Care, Victor-Gadbois, where he arrived the morning.
"Everything it's always a shock, you can't be prepared on it," he says.
The disease makes its work: an immense weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a delicious lunch, he willingly resigned to help eating.
Couragefully he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers around him, bring him his medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is to heal my diarrhea, as this is humiliating," he tells.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man is pinking in standing," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor Gadbois home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for certain persons.
"That depends on the person's ability", he notes, taking a backward step.
For, in the opinion of several people who work in the palliative care, major events are taking place in the middle of these reverse steps.
The patients who are assigned to the home for Victor-Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer covered by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Ms. A., 89 years of age, the worst fear of dying "consciously and by embroidery" is.
But because of the disease, I really met my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any desires in life anymore," she says before she accepts that you put her on a mask that helps her breathe.
In the next few days, she still expects a last visit to her son who comes from Italy.
In the Victor-Gadbois home you offer a group of volunteer body care and help in the food intake.
Palliative care will be used if there are no other possibilities.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec there is a bed for palliative care for 11.700 inhabitants.
That's very little if you take into account that we'll all die one day.
Here life is continued under best conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
One grants the dying a mouth care with Brandy or Pepsi depending on the request.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
Tonight his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family and patients in the same way," reports nursing director Nathalie Savard.
In the Victor Gadbois home is no day like the other one.
In addition to an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the court and is well supported by his head cushions while being offended to his honor, a young man of 36 years, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two little children, dies in a tragic way after trying to survive everything.
"Since six months three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients less than 45 years old," said Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients in the home Victor-Gadbois come from their place of residence, 47% come from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, i.e. to a care that should reduce the suffering of patients when the latter reached the final stage of their life, both at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the House Victor Gadbois and the Society for Home Palliative Care in Montreal, are more or less specialized in caring for cancer patients.
Just this great inadequacy in the Quebec health care ensures that several doctors specialized in palliative care are concerned about the adoption of a law on the regulation of mortality and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifest in circulation has been signed by prominent personalities of palliative care such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health system is not powerful enough to ensure that all rights to high-quality palliative care have before accepting to pass on to death aid.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was 14 days with great pain in the emergency, without taking measures to relieve her.
I fear that patients will only die because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients despite the worst forecasts until the last day.
The chances of survival of Hélène Richard were already minimal when she stopped complaining chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologne that I was going to stop the treatment, she answered me that she regretted that I gave up the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was at the end!
No Omnipotent Care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff that it did not allow this desire after their pain has been reduced by a team of palliative care.
However, it must be clearly said that palliative care in pain therapy is not allocating.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of the Palliative Care of the Society of the House of Grand Space Montreal, 8% of patients do not address pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often rely on the terminal sedation that goes on to either sporadic or permanently invade the patient until the time of his death.
We can no longer do as if we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain disorder will have increasingly the opportunity to access this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not reduced, all say the same sentence, "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to slept me," but "I want my pains to be relieved."
The implementation of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship of Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals large extent in Quebec
Officials of the Road Construction Office, companies of the construction industry, money creators of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia every day tell what they know about a great "system" in which construction, officials, politicians, trade unionists and Mafioso are confused.
A "industry" which was very expensive for the Quebec taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has fallen since taking drastic measures," says Jacques Duchesneau, Vice-President of Quebec and former police officer of Montreal.
The scandal was discovered by him as a result of an in-depth investigation of the confusions related to the contracts on road construction in Quebec, which the Prime Minister at that time only disagreed.
The Duchesneau Report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and the bribe of officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the Ministry of Transport has saved a billion dollars from the contracts alone", because some tied their instinct to obtain their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought two mayors to the trap," he adds in the hope that you can "show the tactics behind the individuals".
A 2011 created permanent anticorruption unit
The permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011 with its troops on auditors, detectors and analysts of the government also makes great efforts.
In addition, the "Marteau-Truppe" police, which has caused Montreal's "Channelization Cardill" to be more reluctant in the artificial infringement of the Treaties since 2009...
In the last few weeks, she has made series of house searches and charges for fraud and corruption against local mandates such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next one on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his office as mayor of Laval, the third largest city of Quebec.
It is suspected that in exchange for public procurement, it has repeatedly accepted lubricants.
More specifically charged were engineers of the Montreal Street Building Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has excited attention by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "System" for the reception of public contracts.
For several years he has paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Mr Zambito had his hand on all sides by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals that were in power at that time.
He also managed to organize an illegal procurement for the former liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Channelisation contracts whose costs were artificially charged by it
In Montreal the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
The former construction engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribe payments of 736,000 dollars as a counterpart for channeling contracts, whose cost he artificially exposed.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they have been tampered by artificially exposing the invoices with false additional services by 30-40%.
In addition, a organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his cash with black money.
As a result of these revealings, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which invaded Montreal in a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first MEPs to be alarmed.
As mayor of the city district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she refused to sell a municipal property from 2010 onwards, which was purchased for $5 million and sold further for 1.6 million to builders in the booming real estate market.
70% Black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation that is finally carried out, she says that it "drives on a thread that allows you to understand the functioning of the ants' immigration system in order to stop the evil and provoke the debtors".
She says that the process is " painful but positive."
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but we need a research unit that is only for Montreal, as well as an oversight to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, on the other hand, notes that "People stole several hundred million dollars," but especially thinks about the role of the "mandate carriers who are about the tactics in the picture", if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a share of 70% of black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he whispers: "I was told that this was only a weak loss of reality."
The Quebec Government proposes to limit donations to the parties to $100, which would not change the situation: "As long as the campaign spending is not strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system of public procurement and the financing of the parties: "We cannot fall deeper; by going to the ground with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and that of Montreal, Mr Duchesneau urges those who laugh about to take a look at their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you have adopted a new scale with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me daily to improve my level of play.
And in a game, this is even easier.
In the football everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
Since my beginnings in the center of the preparatory training of the INF Clairefontaine until my play time at Saint-Etienne, I have progressed gradually.
They therefore take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new accesses this summer are used to carrying games very high levels.
They also know that each training unit is decisive.
This leads to a player like me, having to offer the forehead and want to give its best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot about my play position.
He's supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I did.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti invokes respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in the Ligue 1 and he is one of the best trainers in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected associations.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January I had a encouraging conversation with him.
At that time, I just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has put in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took us the place of the top rider.
But we're watching in the back.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we have qualified ourselves in this way for the eight-final.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have to speak with our words against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to become the first of our group before Porto so that we can play the replay of the eight-elfinal as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European association in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
In order to become a large European association, Paris has to win titles and make itself a name in the long term.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financially giving its resources to take concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in the Ligue 1, as was the case in the last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year we really want to say this title.
During the last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry the victory.
We have finished the season with a very strong performance.
We completed with 79 points.
Usually you should be master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved a even better season.
I think this year's the right thing.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux ring around the title, I think we have the stuff to win him.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We accept that perfectly.
However, if we win a home game against Troyes 4-0 and you still find something you can suggest, that is certainly a bit frustrating.
You wonder what the people are expecting.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to create a game concept.
A team builds up in time.
In the Champions League we proved strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn't managed to qualify for the eight-finals since two seasons, and who also made huge expenses!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to play break with 15 points in advance!
That meant that our opponents and the French championship would be overlooked.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were "paved" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope we will be the smiling winner in May and tell us that we have finally won them despite all the difficulties.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So better that one speaks of a "slatan dependency".
That means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and shoots many gates.
That's why he came and he proves that he's the star of the Ligue 1.
Everywhere he played, he has taken in mind that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those who surround him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders worldwide, also allows all others to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 EM with the French National Team?
Like a disappointment.
It was my heart to participate in this EM.
Sadly, my injuries prevented me from putting out some game time.
I've seen things from which I've been strengthened.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what happened in Ukraine, we have drawn our doctrine, and today we have to show an exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national trainer is strict, stands close to the players and stimulates the victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the EM.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the uncertainty forced in Spain (1:1) in October 16?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has used for all the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a similar game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is possible: conviction that the current monetary system designed by bank monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, the bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertable to dollars, euros etc.) and a protocol for safe exchange such as BitTorrent, which enables direct exchange of files.
About 200,000 transactions have already been collected with 15,000 computers in the network.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After the Bitcoin course reached a peak of $30 in June 2011 (EUR 23), he fell to $2 five months later before he recovered to about $10 today (the courses are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, in a report on virtual currencies published in October, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest for this.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "like the traditional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the "crites", which are used to move forward in a video game that can be won or purchased by playing (and sometimes also exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is monitored and processed by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously keepers of the accounting book, auditors, money issuers as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment, which ensures anonymousity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the handled bitcoins are available in the public accounts book that is spread throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction into this book.
This is done through a mathematical task launched on the computers, adding this additional line to the winner, who is a type of provisional central banker.
It is a fragment of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (so many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right number.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay with the same money twice very fast (less than 10 minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated from the network and the other would remain without link, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that has solved the task gets 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are therefore limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to a hundred million pieces, which leaves a certain space...
Furthermore, the difficulty of the task is increased by any improvement in the computation performance.
The life of the network has already had heights and depths.
The websites that provide Bitcoin services were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin deposits.
"The weakness used does not concern the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a company for paying with real money and using the network Bitcoin.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has this deficiency.
Important players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the blog platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the accounting book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "Mega lock sales" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, is pleased to convert the bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also author of a book about this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages its identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented with dealers, and the latter do not have to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to specify one address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, specify Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
It is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are covered in favour of more horizontally oriented systems.
"It'll take some time to pass Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB proposes to review the various risks that are considered high today in the event of a success of this currency.
We've been withdrawn from Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the USA should follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan Army to take possession of their territory again, and that the Afghan people decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by viewing them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and devoted.
Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also of farmers who refuse a armed foreign presence, as did the Soviets.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiken have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local rebels, the latter will no longer be there when the Western countries become more discreet.
The deduction of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I have observed by a hill planted with almond trees, which was financed by the aid of French loans, was properly carried out.
The truck and tank convois overflowed by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014 there will be no more streams of the Taliban in Kabul.
The conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was defeated from war due to the fights of the various retroversial groups.
Their acquisition of power was then considered a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaida organization, but their situation has not improved until today.
Former Mudshaheddin, the Afghan government and current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important personalities of the Anti-Sovean War have come back to power in 2001.
They have turned into business owners by confiscating government property to sell them as a building country to refugees from Iran and Pakistan and thus benefited from the massive American subcontraction.
They have disgusted themselves, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I heard it in the campaigns, people wish a government that does not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as did those who could make the American benefits: the capital refuge is considerable.
The young people have filled the war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed their advantages.
About 65% of the population are under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series representing a modern world is viewed everywhere.
There's a army now.
Are the authorities under whose command force it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Sovean struggle are already striving to restore the militias in the province who will withdraw from the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities should have benefited from some decentralization in the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of the Prime Minister, which was since the Constitution of 1964, the USA wanted to make a centralized state with a strong presidential force.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections planned for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and has long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional staves are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; except for fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is put to the forefront.
In a country based on 30 years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been required.
The rumor has been spread that Afghanistan possesses immense soil treasures.
This further strengthens the impression that the Western countries were only on site to empower them.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for exporting over the mountains, no mining is possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) make their excavations on the vast Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish normal relations.
The deduction of French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: girls and youngongymnasia, Institute of French at the universities, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural sectors, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was suspended in 2012, has carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous non-profit work and measures for the renovation of agriculture, and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation to try to "win the hearts and spirits" and to achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aids and offensive actions.
These work, for which numerous local workers were required, could help to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase agricultural areas.
What souvenir do we leave after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys that are often more than 2,000 metres.
The message received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order to liberate farmers from the uprising of foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their desire, it would be necessary to continue less, well-controlled and directly related civil assistance in their favour.
A Constitution with the Brechstange in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains split more than ever with regard to the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants him the unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on a card.
To be surprised, he announced on Wednesday that the Constitutional Assembly would adopt its final version on the next day.
Just one week ago, the Head of State had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of his work.
For almost two years, Egypt has now been based on a provisional, multiplely modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal interference.
This new initiative has only provided for an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "at the right with feet".
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the brothers to refrain from their efforts to explain the section section of the Egyptian section to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to re-establish its public and democratic legitimacy while protesting throughout the country.
After reaffirmations in an interview with the American Weekly Watch Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well.
Especially because the Egyptian people, with this resignation to an overhaul vote, an ultimatum is put: "Don't you agree for my draft or I keep the unlimited power," the latter should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 Islamist members of this constitutional assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not responded to the call.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they have turned away because they feel that they have not been able to implement their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to achieve the decision-making capacity last morning, 11 persons, deputy members, were added in every hurry.
Some are very close to the Muslim brothers.
It is not surprising that the articles have been adopted mostly unanimously.
Moreover, the commentators found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, since some members of the Board felt that the Pendeluhr of the Constitutional Assembly did not go precisely.
The text, which has been adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all the attention, finally remains identical to that of the Constitution of 1971 and states that "the principles of Scharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important requirement, had the hope of substituting "the principles" by "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a proof of their good will and of their respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"synagogue" responds to the liberals who only view this as a propaganda strike.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place on other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which acknowledges an advisory role to the University of Al-Azhar, in particular as regards the review of conformity with the laws of Shariah.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because "the persons who are asked for an opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
One can see the first signs of a theocracy."
The fears of liberals are also nourished by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less impaired than the current.
"At present time, there is no specific religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained partly in the French system," stresses Alexis Blauet, who writes a doctoral work on the Egyptian Constitutional Transition.
He admits, however, that "in terms of Article 220 there may be a plurality, as the terms used have been rejected from the religious vocabulary.
This refers in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisdiction, Ann. d. Red.].
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is strongly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslims argue that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's request, the examination of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
There will also be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military courts, as the Unions have requested to defend human rights.
The latter also communicate their fears regarding the text that they see as a threat to freedom.
The existence of the blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no longer refers to the protection of women, Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy places, the navel of the world, and a sea from Sole
The praised land unites in itself the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and unfailing nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Avoid from the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River in which Jesus was baptized.
It says that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: the transformation of water into wine on a wedding celebration, walking on the water, the silence of the sea tower and fishing.
Here Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries, however, are found in Jerusalem.
Faithful people take the path of suffering or crossing of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the grave church on Mount Golgotha, where the crossing place, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here is the Christian view of the navel of the world that symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where a Christian legend grew the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most holy place of the Jews - the mourning walls, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, there leave people of different religious directions notes with desires that then come into fulfillment.
Take a trip to the height
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hide from enemies that Herod the Great built for his family in 25 C.E.
They are located on a rock wall in the mountains in 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountain climbers can reach the ruins by their own power.
All others bring an airline to this historic summit.
In the north of the country in 1600 to 2040 meters height is the famous ski resort Hermon, where it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there with a shuttle bus.
The skiers have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposed to live on the mountain summit.
Visit Unique Museums
There are nearly 300 museums in this country.
On one trip only, not all of them can be visited.
However, at least the five most interesting ones should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum near the Knesset (Parlament).
There old Qumran manuscripts or scrolls of the Dead Sea, found in rock hills in the Judean desert, are stored as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modgliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathdieners at that time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are neither museum leaders nor souvenir shops.
Access is free and donations are essentially rejected.
The fifth museum, namely the Holocaust museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, relates to one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most aggressive department is the monument for the children built to remember the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars are sparkling.
And the names of the Jewish children and of the countries in which they died sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel lie on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three places there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinarians and oceanarians.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea also baths in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms up to 23 °C.
The dead sea is even warmer and there is bathed all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea with a location of 417 meters below sea level is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and thus even wears non-swimmers problemless on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt soles) and healing mucous as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and for the calming of strapate nerves.
Touch the Mysteries of Ancient
These secrets are the old town of Tel Aviv, namely the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city, the famous sea path that links Egypt, Syria, anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to traditions, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved here the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to walk through the narrow streets named after star signs.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend after all those touching the walls in the gate with their star signs.
In Jaffa you can meet newly married couples from all over Israel and even other countries at photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can strike through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the crucifixes.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and residence of the Roman governor, including Pontius Pilate.
In the carefully restored theater, evening concerts and operas are shown today.
Watchlist for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English knowledge: about 30% of Israeli speak Russian.
The money in the trip is rather taken in no euros, but in dollars that can be easily changed to Shekel (actual exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you mostly go ahead with the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only subway line of the country with six stations connecting the suburb with the upper city.
Actually, it is an underground motorway.
A ride within the city costs 6 shekels independently of the means of transport, which includes travelling for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is held in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the work week starts.
In many cafés, restaurants and restaurants, only food is served, which excludes pigmeat, marine products, fish without shells and foods containing both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different dishes with hammel and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various souses, fresh balls of purified beans and herbs (falofle) as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no sweating dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this there are many well-feeded cats that scatter cozyly and unremittingly through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parking cars.
The cats like lively places and don't say no to delicious things.
A car hire costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs additional 15 dollars per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Access cards for museums cost 30 shekels in average.
In figures
In 2012, over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 Thousands of Ukrainian tourists came to the proclaimed country, which corresponds to an increase of 51% compared to the comparison period in 2010, before the withdrawal of visa obligations on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While MEPs and civil law discuss the benefits of the law on binding language tests for migrants, criminals are already acting with fake certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the homeland.
On 1 December, a law entered into force which requires each migrant to test a knowledge of Russian language.
Until now, this scheme applies only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in retail trade.
However, the tests, according to federal migration authority, will become a duty for all guest workers in the future.
It is not only for language tests, but also for tests into Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both receipt and extension of work permits.
Exemptions apply only to citizens of countries in which Russian is official.
This law also exempts persons who have received their training certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991.
Sensible, problematic and protection of rights
The total number of audit centres will be held under the Egy of the Puschkin Institute for Russian Language, the Russian University of People's Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can test the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centres have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to initiate the tests was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
However, before the entry into force of the law in the press several times asked civil lawmakers: What does the whole actually bring?
What changes does the regulation make to provide language skills, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Especially, speakers of the migration authority are about to reduce the number of forced workers.
"Many are now talking about the protection of labour migrant rights," says Viktor Sebelew, head of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before their departure.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise from migrants without occupation, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language knowledge will necessarily meet people with evil intentions, who, under the pretext of help, put him into a dark, narrow barrack, where he will endure with dozens of his same months without food and documents and will create 12 to 14 hours a day.
We reach many complaints from our migrants.
"In the home country the one will be promised to you, and when you arrive, you will be deceived, taken off their passports and don't receive the promised wage," confirms the Head of the Head of Labour Migration of the Tajikian Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't shy, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their money in Russia admit that they can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language, not only the language of the destination country.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only few turkmens, Uzbekken and Tajiken can only afford a reasonable basic education.
For there is not even money in their families to feed the children, for they are silent to buy decent clothes, shoes and school things.
As a teenager, these children take the first opportunity to earn money immediately.
"It's difficult without language knowledge," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Citizens stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status must put the test down.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
At the same time, most of the guest workers remain illegal in Russia.
"A welcome" or "Attachment for Unauthorised"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason are bureaucratic barriers and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
In addition, the legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are mostly faked and we are not registered, and then there are cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajike Umed Huschkadamow says to journalists.
"Don't shy any costs for false papers"
Already on the day when the law entered into force, it turned out that not only the migrants' registration documents can be faked.
Some fake certificates that confirm the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with a normal colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them for nothing: Every migrant who hoped to save the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as much as the cost of the official test: this costs a migrant of work three thousand rubles.
In view of the fact that the most important direct task is to protect the system from corruption so that the certificates cannot be purchased easily, both officials and citizens agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise that they will receive time for a language base course for the first time through the test.
In addition, new arrivals are offered without language skills in areas where no active understanding with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry Ignores illegal arms market
Participation of legal weapons in crimes extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to strengthen the weapons law for private arms owners.
The authorities react to the recent events: Damaged in shooting to weddings and seven dead in the amocracy of the Moscow lawyer Dmitri Winogradov.
The police want to prohibit wearing non-dead weapons in the public and increase the age for the possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the President of the Duma Committee on Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted shortly to the Duma.
Not all are satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "toothing the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, whose author - representatives of various arms associations - demands that the authorities take away from "sinceless hardenings".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, the criminal judge, Wasilij Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes with the use of the registered weapons were committed in 2012, while a total of 1.168 thousand offences were reported for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a strengthening of the law on private arms owners will not prevent criminals from using on the black market.
According to the authors, in Moscow, you can find any weapon for little money.
At the same time, the Ministry of Interior stresses that the distribution of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons come across several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, tells a former Chief Victor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the General Stake.
Screenshot of a website that accepts arms orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fights in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel there are illegal weapons that are stolen by criminal guards.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from the police arms chambers as well as directly from the criminal enforcement authorities.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons camps.
In many military camps, explosions often occurred.
"There is evidence that some of the cases were burning to cover the lack of weapons," says the former military member.
According to Baranez, the weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms plants that do not stand up with international competition and therefore slide the weapons under the hands of the black market, for example in Moscow," the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is the smuggling.
Especially many pistols and weapons come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a own, sometimes crafty production and a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011 a report was written by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminological Literature and publicly accessible data on portals of weapons.
According to the investigators, the main part of the illegal weapons is from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there by the "debt of responsible people who have been involved in their work with weapons," says the report.
According to researchers’ data, 17% of the weapons from conflict areas are derived from 14% of the dietary in the production of weapons, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant of a weapons store, not mentioned in particular, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have been buying no more for a long time since they are obsolete.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to get the aftermath in a weapons camp.
A gun, for example a gun of type TT, is purchased via a fence.
The gun is issued and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun into the city and sells it there for 900 Euro per piece with two magazines," he says
"Of course, the police knows everything and therefore, if it cannot comply with the plan for detecting crimes, periodically purchasing checks for dealers offering illegal weapons," the sales advisor adds.
"How in the luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers are most often found about acquaintances.
I had viewed websites and blogs when someone became aware of me and suggested to come to the "Begowaja" station, where a person would wait for me to take me to a certain place where we could then negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the gun there
Military Commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers on the markets, but there you have to go and deal with a code such as "Iwan Iwanowitsch, who lets the daughter lose a tooth".
I'm even coming to some hit rings about a friend I trust.
He also delivers me the beat rings only because he knows I don't care for him.
New people are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military member Victor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on this subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which "everything possible" was pictured.
"I felt like in the luxury shop," the military member recalls.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
I, as a potential customer, not just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we put a target disc on.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results on websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed or there are personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy fighting pistools or gun".
There users give up your orders and ask requests.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without license," users asks "Iwan" (worthual quotation).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the Laconic request from "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go up to the service to the network.
The people come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberia and can shake coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible shall accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money over a banking machine.
"As an answer he receives a photo and a description of the hiding of the weapon," reports the press speaker of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitrij Kislow.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that at the end you can also leave empty and get behind grids by placing an inquiry on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently switched countless web pages, and buyers who want to acquire weapons go up to the service to the network.
"The people come like hungry fish in feeding and then land in Siberian labour camps and can shake coal," he says.
Makarow for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal guns, prices of $100 to $900 are expected.
According to Dmitrij Kislow from the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of type Makarow for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military arms camps by overseers of the middle range.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of illicit weapons in Russia fell by 7% to 22.9 thousand during the period from January to October 2011, while the number of cases of thievery and depression discovered fell by 7.8% in connection with weapons, ammunition, explosives and springing devices.
In the United States, fast food and supermarket employees are striking
Every fourth American youth sits behind the checkout of Mc Donald's
During the past days, massive protests against low wages have been made throughout the USA in branches of Walmart and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon come out of the air.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-handed non-profit organisations.
In addition to increasing the modest wages of simple whalemart and fast-food employees, the organizers of the protests pursue the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this industry of the economy has hardly been organized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, on which sales took place in the USA, attracting millions of customers, which sometimes led to hand joints.
On that day, some of the whalemart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work together with trade unions and left activists, branches of the chain, whose target group are low and medium-sized income.
Walmart sells all products, from windels over hunting guns and car batteries to dust cleaners, eggs and milk.
The product in the Walmart branches is averaged between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many of the small-paid Walmart employees buy only at their own workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods so cheaply because the employees are paid badly.
The latter also complain about severe working conditions, such as missing forklifts or hand scanners.
The participants of the protests on "Black Friday" demanded wage increases and expressed their annoyance that the contribution for operating health insurance had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical whalemart worker who earns $9.5 the hour could not afford this increase, they said.
Researchers from the California University in Berkeley demonstrate that if the company increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
These are about 1.1% more than they donate now for wages.
If Walmart completely changed the wage increases to customers, every purchase would cost them only 46 cents more.
This would be for them a year compared to today's multi-outputs of only $12.39.
Advocates of Walmart are pleased to note that there were only protests in nine states and that they did not give any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted the next day in its shop from 8 o'clock at Thursday to midnight, and Walmart sold about 5000 items per second during this period.
In total, the Walmart cupboards carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
In an interview on the website of the left-hand Huffington Post, the speaker of the company, Dan Fogelman, claimed that "less than five" Walmart employees were working and that the protest action was only "an additional PR-Trick" of the trade union that organized the protests.
"Free voucher!"
The protests continued this week in New York, but their goal was not Walmart branches (which are not desired in this advanced city and are therefore inexistent) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sells billions of portions, and nevertheless they don't give you any days of sickness, and you're not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage according to federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually increased, but not too strong, and on average their simple employees in New York 8.90 US dollars get the hour.
Less than she deserves no one in this expensive city.
As it is possible to get out in New York with so little money, I can't understand.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all US youths were behind the theke after school at McDonald's, but the young people were still living with their parents.
Few of them saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's staff, people constantly complain that they have to come out with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, whose author notes that it is unresponsible to get children if you don't know how to feed them.
The participants of the protests that began on Thursday at 6.30 p.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street and Madison Avenue requested that the cashier and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of 15 US dollars the hour, which is more than a double of the present minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law forbids corporate leadership to stand in the way of this goal and to reject or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy for them.
However, the establishment of trade unions in the fast-food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff fluctuation.
Unsatisfied
Heavily protested this day also before many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protest was a meeting in the afternoon before the McDonald's at Times Square, where some local democrats spoke, including city council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and nevertheless they don't give you any sickness days, and you will not be paid for your honest work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent New York democrats, for example, mayor candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should support the fast-food employees together so that they can obtain a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves!".
According to New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast-food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on site, not all of whom are mainly busy in the fast-food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is still not possible to see if the radio of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be overlist moderately so far"
The topic of enlarged reality, which is popular for trailers of modern technologies, is recently usually perceived by the lens of a special glass.
First, Google presented a functioning model during his annual conference in summer, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had also registered a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies in the Microsoft Lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glass was only a passage station for the company's scientists.
It stimulates the possibility of manipulating virtual objects in the air with mere hands and creating virtual free spaces.
- Please briefly describe what research your group conducts.
- We are dealing with the interaction of human and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
To date, humanity has remained mostly stuck in the phase, working with pixels on flat-screen screens, which are sometimes also touched.
However, we want to look forward to 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and the Kinect sensors are a progress, and today no more Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What's going on for us in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much still plays on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been crucial.
We try to change this, work on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more fascinating.
However, it is necessary not only for the user but also for its environment to be recognized.
Then we could add the real world much easier through virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these shaken virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about language control?
She's popular, but isn't she overevaluated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because it does not always want to inform all the surroundings about its actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but every one in its particular niche.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects in public places on a project where we experimented with short and short, rather than with charging gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a bracelet clock.
However, the future in general belongs to mixed control types, such as Gestik and language.
- How so?
- For example, we'd ask you to put this dish to you?
They say it and show it at the same time.
Usually I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very difficult to recognize.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can afford at the respective time and what not?
- Not necessarily, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we will need to work primarily on the development of new sensor types, allowing people to get more accurate reactions.
For example, these can be laser sensors, as they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your requirements based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
In this way, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only the resolution along the X and Y, but also along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The movements of human beings are extremely dynamic and openly said, the current 30 fps are especially too little for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor with a regulatable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds in our Redmond laboratory, while today's commercial sensors are closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed exactly such a device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared channel and the second one receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras may solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem, as more calculations would be necessary.
Beautiful would be a flexible, Kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera affections to determine how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember, Microsoft did not present his glasses to the public, unlike Google.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of the technology of expanded reality in everyday life, the glass has the best prospects?
- Of course it is not pleasant to always keep a smartphone on the way in the elevated hand, but I think the following: The most great variant would be a "changing" enlarged reality in which we could switch over a cloud from the glass to the smartphone,
The glass is a personal gadget and it is its strength (privates can only see you), but at the same time also its weakness, because an enlarged reality through glass prevents you from working together with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only accessible to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is a problem that often points to the critic of this idea: there is no sensitive reaction!
Your hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures I often speak that the expanded reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of the tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unusual projection document.
She's very exquisitely experiencing pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at granting the "pictures in the air", for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams in a particular point where the finger is located, a feeling that is currently as weak as someone pushes over the handballs.
There are also belts for the wrist that affect the nervous ends in the fingers, even this is a potential direction.
- Did you try to overlist the brain?
It makes it feel what it should feel when it just sees something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that we will have to fight with for a long time, namely to believe a person who is physically located in a closed room, instead he is in an open, practically infinite space; here we work on concepts with loopbands (other than in fitness studios), moving platforms and large balls.
To date, the brain can only be overlist moderately, and there are many working years ahead.
This is exactly what makes the work in the field of virtual reality so appealing to a researcher: on many topics we are only at the beginning.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", which is dedicated to city residents forming the Avantgarde of Art and Culture.
On the read list, high-ranked representatives of the Petersburg art scene already landed, whose successes go beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The entire city knows Kirill Miller, the red- dressed beards, which can be found at the Russian museum, once at the summer garden, at scene trips or on decays.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract great masses of people.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright personality of the Petersburg Avantgarde at the end of the 80s or early in the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and adorns with his presence on the street his fellow citizens a smile in the face and ensures good mood with them.
Recently, he grabbed a rotary organ and became the Petersburg rotary player, since he finally felt ready for this difficult role in his artist’s existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you always going in red and not in yellow or turquoise in town?
I have chosen the color Red as fashion designers who deal with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image advisor and society.
In society, everything that deviates from the horror calls for aggressions and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my previous provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Cultural Palace of Newskij, where my works were exhibited.
I understood I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters ended at that time, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I was friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonewschina", and it created "Puschkinskaja 10", and then it was finished.
It attracts me to the theater, fashion, music, actually to everything, except literature.
And all this united in your art clinic... it was important for me to be at the centre of the Petersburg culture where the best creative artists were to gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in the Puschkinskaja 10, where there was a musical and artistic club for the Bohemian, the house of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to play-back, wore tight tricots and among them was the composer Igor Wdowin, who is today.
When the group started playing live, her "Leningrad" became.
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but the foundations he learned from us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also originates in the Art Clinic.
Our employees and family guests went there.
I'm a hero of the past century when culture meant something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artists of the Year", and so I was at the peak.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a person of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to be famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: one can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my images are real pearls and clearly express the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it is painful and scared to be like that.
In a clown, all of this blurs and loses his tragic.
I love the bigske, and I have big ideas.
For example, we rescue the world by prescribe that everyone has to be fully dressed.
Now, everyone pays attention to the clothing and is oriented on the outside and not on the inside of man.
But maybe you should not give your hand to a man, but spuck him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing.
- We recently saw you in the role of the city's rotary organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the decay of cultures.
Earlier, people formed large groups: Bohemia loved the one and the simple people the other.
Now there are microcommunities, and it is difficult to please all.
I'm not a $100 note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think of who you're going to like.
Now every cult star has about 100 trailers.
- But to Stas Michailow's appearances come several thousand!
- Forgive women come to him, there the sexual social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes under.
I have trailers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy it.
In my youth I painted such pictures that were even in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually come only at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It means spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something quite different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That's the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
It is said, Servants of Culture.
But not every one of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real tsars, because the tsars may not have understood much of culture, but they understood that right experts are necessary.
In Moscow there are currently good consultants.
In Petersburg we have those who could be experts, but they are blocked, as more high-level experts need to evaluate the first ones properly and make them free.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and therefore some painters need to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding nutritional ground.
On our stones art can only grow hard.
We need a cultural soil, for for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, that's much less.
Art has to be modern again, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is financed from grants from the city of St Petersburg
Birth in the All
Earth in danger.
Heating or collision with killerasteroid.
Caravans of space ships with earth's inhabitants on board are looking for a spare planet.
In order to save mankind, is the important question of how we can continue to plant ourselves in the severity or on the spare planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
De facto there are only two real planets that we could at least live hypothetically.
"Only Mars and Venus," says the scientist of the Astronomical Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, on the surface of Venus there is a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at a large height or in the circulation of the Venus, i.e. in the All.
The researchers first discussed the question of reproduction in all with regard to the flora.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century before.
The fourth generation of herbs cultivated in the orbit did not at least differ from the earthly species.
It followed the breeding of insects, more precise of tiny fruit flying (Drosophila), in the orbit.
In 1979, Wachteeier was sent to space to explore the impact of gravitylessness on the development of embryos.
It develops a very normal chick.
But then the problem starts.
"The problem is that the chick needs to stop; it must be able to stand on its legs and begin moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute for Medicinal Biological Problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without a solid underground, the chicks were wild.
Ten hours later, the instincts of the newborn completely demolished.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"Two times we got chicks and then put the whole thing in place, because it's simply impossible to work with them," says Wladimir Sychew for the failed experiment with the chicks in all.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into the orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" there will be only gender species.
There was an experiment with rats who were already fertilized into all.
In principle, nothing has been identified specially.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and research needs to be continued," says Wladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space councils got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved so far.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are cut out of their natural habitat can simply not follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans could do this in principle.
The Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
Such experiments are not carried out from ethical considerations.
However, women have been flying into all for 50 years.
The greatest risk was Tereschkowa.
The most valuable thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our mowers fled away, and no one on earth could have answered the question: Is it surpassing the space flight?
Will she be able to bring a child to birth after this flight?
"Finally, nobody answered this question," says Space Veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonautine, Valentina Tereschkowa, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988 the second woman in the All, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in the orbit and even carried out works outside the space vehicle, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, a risk remains.
We have very few cosmonauts, where after long flights everything went well and they got healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when wings to the orbit," concludes Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet, humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory at the Cosmonaut preparatory centre is a mandatory station during the flight preparation.
Here, in a sweat condition, the cosmonauts win routine for work in the open space.
The water represents the weightlessness.
Even if adults feel water is pleasant, it is a strange environment; but infants feel water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders were witnessing that life in the country escaped from the ocean.
There is a link between the fact that a child is located in the mother’s belly in the fruit water about nine months and that it can then be more easily used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since from birth to the first swimming just two weeks pass.
"That's too little time to forget something," says baby swim teacher Marina Aksenowa.
So while a newborn child’s gravity is a much more natural condition, the woman does not come out without gravity.
In the state of gravitylessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscle becomes enormously rapidly reduced and thus also reduces the ability to print out the child.
All right, let's handle this by means of an introductory aid.
The birth could also take place in a special chamber to express the child.
"But what happens then?" is the non-insignificant question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the education, the organism cannot train the skeleton and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a stress suit in the orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply miss what is of fundamental importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we make together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the creation of a disabled person, a perfectly inappropriate person," presupposes the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medicine Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestow.
Until now, the birth of children in the world is a mere theory.
At some point, however, it will be reality when the earth’s inhabitants break up in their space ships into a remote planet that will be the home for their descendants born in All.
NEO Chief: Control of the Black System failed by guilt of politics
Czech Republic has good control bodies and appropriate laws in connection with public procurement, but does not fall back in its application.
In the discussion for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Newvyšší kontrolní úřad, NCIE), Miloslav Kala.
"A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied properly - and this is not the case with us, I think," Kala commented on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be a common control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative example of practice, he leads to the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "Black System".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not harass the entrepreneurs with controls - is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the presidency of the government, and the Control Office, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, is inhibiting in its activity," Kala states.
At the meeting of the Board of Audits, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of the two countries concerning public contracts were compared.
What was the point?
This is a parallel examination that we started about two years ago.
Simplifiedly, it is about the fact that the European legislatives define how to handle public procurement, which builds up national legislation, and, finally, there is the real practical application.
All of this we have compared, and although the examination has not yet been completed, we have been able to detect extremely interesting differences. In general, the laws may even be a "harder and perfecter," but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to set up new and more precise rules again and again. It is also necessary to deal with the actual application of law.
How can the project help you? What is the result of this project?
Just such a common control could help us to stop trying constantly to perfect the laws and to reduce and deteriorate thresholds, if this seems not particularly positive.
Economics means to acquire one thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and to exclude unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But the reduction of thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even so that in this way we only load the system with excessive "papercram", and those who seek gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than when the thresholds remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a authority similar to our NKU here, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German borrower is to the NCIU of the Bundesrechnungshof, which is similar to that of us and also has a college that is only a little differently formed. However, both authorities work similarly.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a state, i.e. that there are these accounting offices also in the various federal states - in which the German system differs from ours.
The BRH may only control federal funds which correspond to our state resources.
Public resources managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of national accounting courts.
As regards German legislation, is it easier than ours?
In general, I would only like to compare this without specific information. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in all.
Is that because the verifiers are better there?
That certainly not, but, as I said, I do not like such comparisons particularly.
To this end, it should also be noted that those countries who are a model for us also have to struggle with problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have any cooperation with our authority, would they?
With regard to the Czech legislation, how important was the revellation of the grant law for your authority, do you already feel any consequences?
In view of the fact that these novels are in force for a short time, it has not yet been affected by our trials.
As our controls take place afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, in the preparatory phase of future controls, we have introduced the new control instrument "detection of risks of imefficiency" and examined and analysed with these almost 14,000 public contracts - the changes will naturally affect here, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among others.
Do you see the adoption of this law more positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "harder" and can no longer be observed.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are to account for the fact that any non-compliance with the grant law is equal to violation of the budgetary discipline.
But is it sensible to make the law even more stringent?
I do not think it is in this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out here?
First, let's say what way is not targeting.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not clarify the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the presidency of the government and hinder the control authority, whose duty is to control compliance with the law, in its activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he cannot say that we do as if nothing.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal implementation of certain operations - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder is excluded with the best offer only because of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied properly - and that is what I think is missing.
On the streets there is a single ice cream, but mostly they are dry.
There is some snow and ice glass on the streets of the Czech Republic.
However, most of the roads are well accessible, sometimes increased caution is required.
KaribaKarlsbad
In the district of Karlsbad, the roads were well driven this morning, snow and ice creamed.
Temperatures decreased to -5 to -10 °C, over the day it should be slightly warmer.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the deeper heights only a thin snow cover remains.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the combs of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district road guard, there was limited view due to fogs.
The highway R6 and the roadways of the first road class in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is required, for example, to bridges on which the trains are sometimes required and smooth.
All roadways of the second and third streets, including mountain roads, are also available.
However, some of these roads remain required or exhausted snowrests.
In particular in the higher locations, increased attention is therefore required.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets of East Bohemia there is danger of ice cream, in higher locations and in the mountains there is sometimes an experienced snow layer on the streets, the road and motorway directorate informs on their websites.
The street championships warn drivers against ice cream, which can occur especially in higher locations in the Pardubice District.
Ice glasses can be found in the districts of Lanškroon, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto, in particular on the roads of the second and third street class.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly located on the streets in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické Hory Mountains.
An experienced snow layer is located on the streets of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia it is mostly sunny or cheerful today, and it remains largely depressive.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, it blows a weak wind.
Pilsen County
The roads in the Pilsen District are now well feasible, but locally there is increased attention, and the driving direction is adapted to the weather.
This is frozen in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below the freezing point.
Since it had snowed before and the temperatures fell afterwards, the streets may come to ice cream.
Locally, fog is also expected, but the view will improve in the day's history.
These data are derived from the district street championships.
The motorway D5 is practically fully accessible, but increased attention recommends the road masteries between the 80th and the 131th kilometre.
The trains of the first street class are mainly dry but frozen.
However, in the south of the circles of Pilsen and Tachov, ice cream can be reached in part.
The trains of the second and third street class are moist and therefore the reference to possible required sections is also here.
Drivers should be particularly careful mainly on the less frequent roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
With snow-match today, drivers who are travelling towards the elevators in the Olomouc District.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snowmate stays on the Pass Červenohorské sedlo as well as on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Night snow drift forced the street championships to use, in the Šumperk circle, according to road management fell about 3 cm new snow.
In the other areas of the district, the roadways are usually fully permissible.
"In the circle of Šumperk, there are still snowrests in the heights.
On the Pass Červenohorské sedlo, the drivers have to expect snow-match towards Jeseník," said one of the road management staff Šumperk today to the Agency ČTK.
Their colleagues in Jeseník circle also had to go out in the night, according to their information, the streets are free and wet to the elevators after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Šternberk district, drivers must take care of forest sections, as the roads are still wet here.
Ústí nad Labem District Liberec
In North Bohemia, the street championships report several poorly fable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice glass, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice is locked in the district of Ústí n.K. according to traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero in deeper locations, so that snow and ice are kept on the streets. However, from the low levels, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, no problems are reported, and the streets are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice glass is notified in particular from the surrounding area of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this during the night - day by day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Of the main routes as well as from the road I/13 at the border of the districts Ústí n.L. and Liberec, bad transport conditions are reported.
The blocking of the road between Telnice and Knínice was required due to branches pushed from the snow load to the train.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think of taking place in less than a month of world destruction?
This is one of those catastrophe reports that we like to call people.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make ourselves more fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's fall.
In December you will also implement a unique project with three concerts against the world down.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It is a country-wide beneficiary event that we have been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Maya calendar, whose end is forecast for 21 December at 11:10 in the morning.
On the day before that, i.e. on December 20, three concerts will take place at the same time at 21:00 p.m. in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts should be about at the time when the Maya calendar ends on the Pacific Island of Kiribati, which is located in a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us.
Who originates this idea?
I think it's originally from me, then we've shaped the idea together with our graphicist Honza Augusta.
We do not only want to collect enough positive energy to prevent the world's fall, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we have given this world once to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, pockets and key trailers against the world down, with which the people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other artists, has also taken up the so-called hymne against the world down with the title "World Decay falls Out".
Already today, the hymn on YouTube is very popular. Will it sound to the beneficiary concerts?
Of course, and at the end, provided that everything works and the world's downturn doesn't take place...
The hymne is to be sung by all the artists on all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the hymns are transmitted live in a direct circuit from the Czech television.
The text of the Hymne comes from Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X sings with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech culture scene, which is associated with the realization of many beneficiary events and concerts...
We strive to intensely integrate these people into our projects.
It has shown that most of us are interested in cooperation with us and have fun with it.
What purpose does the revenue of the concerts against the fall of the world benefit?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, on which we have been working with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute for six years.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly cared for by lecturers who help them with different leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, it is intended to create a own building in which we will then enter with this project.
Several groups and artists appear at each concert.
What criteria have you chosen?
We wanted to compile a program that addresses all generations including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý appear.
Learn more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "great events" also planned for the future?
In May we will be taking place at the Prague Spring for the first time, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to appear at the Czech House in New York, and I would like to connect this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already occurred in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group composed of people with disabilities.
How do you handle these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it appears at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair drivers, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage room. Furthermore, we need to drag with many instrument suitcases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems so far, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your foreign travels you have a comparison of how it looks in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than with us, we were witnesses in Russia that in the east everything is still in its beginnings.
Against Prague, Moscow is absolutely not disabled. It is still unusual when someone is travelling in the wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural there that one leaves a wheelchair driver in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations who try to point to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we need to get to the more developed countries?
There are many things we're hanging behind...
However, it should be noted that improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the affected people.
In London and Madrid it is absolutely common that people with severe disabilities can also move independently in public space, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
But it is not quite common that there is a larger group of disabled people actively involved in social events, in which we are a little ahead with the band The Tap Tap the West!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our series will really begin to change.
To date, this is only individual cases of particularly willful personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we go back a few years: What motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a manager at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensively.
And since I'm a musician myself and play Saxofon, I've founded a music-AG together with a colleague.
Well, and in time that, as our moderator, Lá
But the band became known only in the last few years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that cooperation with well-known singers has helped us, and we have also started to actively advertise for us.
We have become aware that if you do something and do not see this outside, your own performance does not exist in a sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford a good reader, high-quality equipment and, among others.
Was it your goal to bring it so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt the potential that things could be handled differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its way, as everything new is considered with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are only few really unique things, and I dare to say that Tap Tap belongs to it.
The first impression that the viewer usually has is of course pity; that is only natural...
But this pity is absolutely unnecessary because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, if they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, this is not just a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something good, you must not compromise in many things and also ask for a certain discipline.
I believe that this is quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have sample twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert trips, then the enthusiasm is quick for many.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of these have been involved from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Laa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come and go.
Whoever has the will and the desire to join in is always welcome to us.
Takes place on the day before the forecast world down, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00 p.m.
Places of events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three places of events are connected by live circulation and it sounds a common interpretation of the hymne "World Disaster Is Out" of the Band The Tap Tap.
The purpose of the concert is to put the means for the equipment of a multifunctional disabled educational centre that is called STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost point: 25 million CZK
Entry costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free, cards are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was a member of this space authority at a meeting of the Member States of the European Space Organization of the ESA. Poland is the second member of the former Eastern Block (after the Czech Republic, which was member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Of course, the path of Poland into space began much earlier.
Before World War II, Polish cosmos enthusiasms were involved in space, not always looking for understanding.
I remember, for example, the lecture of A. Šternfeld of December 6, 1933 in the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneer work "Incoming to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the listeners cold, and after years Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important defender of astronomy and space.
In Polish magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's worldwide recognised contribution to the development of space was recognized, among other things, by one of the craters being named after him on the moon's edge.
Already in 1925, a railway draisine was built in Poland for which a missile drive was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project were unfortunately unknown.
It is not even clear whether the missile should be used to start or brake the Draisine.
The information for this is exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-powered guns.
The research works led the Institut Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
From the documents delivered, it is evident that research has been carried out to the stage of practical tests.
The research was, of course, interrupted by the entry of the German military force.
In 1937, the design of a photo-electric hunting tract appeared in the press of Ing. Rohoziński, and in the following year, the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by the author of Leliwa-Krzywoblocky.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the missile drive.
Shortly before the war, all projects for military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the preceding Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was completed from the beginning of the war.
Following the war, further articles on space appeared in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles of space are dedicated.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space company.
At the time there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was noted that the research of space would have the future.
Already in their beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Company PTA sought to join the in 1951 founded International Föderation for Space, and the PTA became a regular member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), deputy president of the International Föderation for Space.
He had this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the development of the highly successful meteorological missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and did not weigh 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built and in 1959 started in the Błędów Desert flight tests with the two-level RM-2 missile.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another level of development should already be able to perform real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was suspended.
Following the first rockets of type RM, the Meteor-1 missile developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage missile, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of rockets were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from one another in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A missile had a transport space with 0.4 litres of capacity, meteor-1B over 0.34 litres and meteor-1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum flight height was 37 km for all three types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor 2 missile was developed in the Aerospace Institute, whose first flight tests started in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a load of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Afterwards the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, following the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
Poland also participated in space research with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos programme, and in 1978, the Polish Pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercos monaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the law on non-profit work.
This decision raised a vivid discussion in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
This is the cause of the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with implicit financial speculations.
Due to the great differences in the value of work ( wages) price tensions occur.
Under this term, a condition in which the manufacturer tries to maintain economic competition by importing favourable goods by "subsisting competition" in order to increase its share of the market and thus increase its profit.
In a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or buy it cheaply, or to abandon their business. The result is high unemployment in countries with comparable high labour costs.
Since private capital is not responsible for society and therefore not responsible for the unemployment caused by it, government expenditure is necessarily increasing.
This situation is further strengthened by the fact that Mr. entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, thus replacing the overall social and social damage caused by them.
This situation is known in general, so concrete statistics are unnecessary at this point.
The non-concerning practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments deliver their own people to private capital without regard to the social consequences.
This is particularly reflected in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force its own people to accept the dictatorship of private capital in particular in the area of wages.
This happens, on the one hand, through economic forces in long-term unemployment, and on the other, by circumcision of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, there have been public food supplies for arms for several years that are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of affected people is already going into millions.
Due to the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such a low wage that the State must increase their income to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of auxiliary workers employed in the German Bundestag.
There is no doubt that the savings measures of virtually all the EU-South countries will go beyond the same condition where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic crash of their social level (as it was in the 19th century), or to pay for a hungry wage on the margin of society, hoping that private capital will flow into the country at some point.
This is the natural question of where this capital comes from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty moves from one country to another; or capital remains entirely out, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or Africa, employees are actually working for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim that the state should not engage in capital in its own economy and that plan economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital persists closely on its position that the State should not intervene in the economy.
But then we need to ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practically almighty and universal lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, the mutual provision, a legislation, in which practically everything is hard but nothing criminal.
In Germany, the situation is so that a State Ministry of Finance lacks private, close to industry-related legal undertakings devoted to the preparation of legislative drafts.
These draft laws will then be adopted in the Bundestag.
All violence is then not from the people, as it proclaims the Western Constitutions, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal democracies are currently in a situation as they describe Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at times of Caesar and Pompeius': "The state has long been confined in decay, and the offices have been occupied with violence.
Against lubricating money, by unlawful swallowing advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew inhibitorial, and the people went to the election with already purchased votes" ... "People with character did not apply for offices, so that the state had no consul for eight months due to this decay" ... "You really began to talk about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole domination, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought about Pompeius, but then the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy by the sole domination.
As it turns out, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of its own advantage, without paying attention to societal interests.
Private capital has not been able to recognize and enforce the advantage for the entire society from its nature.
The result today, as at the time, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who do not seek deeper reforms in the least.
The cause for the emergence of Fascism and Communism, therefore, must be sought in the careless liberalisation of economic systems in the 19th and 20th century.
From today's state, the destruction of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be considered as a certain break in which the next round is already taking place.
Especially catastrophic is the fact that today's elites face the potential losses of hundreds of thousands of human lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are witnesses of today, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them from older and newer history, in perfect ignorance.
The abolition of the law on non-profit works is not a solution here, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to push down the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore system-conditional.
The only solution are targeted political-social reforms that increase the capital participation of the state in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in the society in favour of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"... that nothing originates from violence or could ever arise" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the Refrain is: "...that we do not forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons didn't want wars, there's no one," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, a number of reactions.
The one stands behind Israel and argues with its right to self-defense, while they call the Palestinians terrorists; the others, in turn, support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs, and call the state of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is in these ever-return waves of the debtor and who is victim; finally, today's inhabitants of Israel, including self-administrative areas, have been born into the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
It is my concern to open the view of the readers behind the scenes, the glance of whom the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) are primarily serving in the small spots of land in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts; others are derived from them and come out of my own understanding of who or which group of people influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can make up an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
The less obvious question is whether it were really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether someone was behind their throne who directed their deeds to a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we are living in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power resulting from it has not originated within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one particularly emphasizes that could be described as the head of the rack (I don't know if anyone is above them, but I do not exclude this) - the Rothschilds.
Many are not written about them.
It's understandable.
The first press agency (Reuters) was already purchased by the Rothschilds in the 19th century, in order to prevent the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in whose background was always the fortification of their power, the increase of their assets or both of them.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the central banks, they carry out wars or prepare themselves on them (before the attack on Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall Ghaddafis remained only four, with Russia in the meantime subordinating its central bank to the Russian Government).
Anyone who tried to oppose this family had to pay with life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue own (speaking: state) banknotes during the civil war and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was murdered in 1963; Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for the dissolvement of the world economic crisis in 1929.
The global power desires of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to form a plan for the defeat of three world wars by Albert Pik, a free martyr of the 33th and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war aimed at eliminating Europe's major monarchist states, the second war should break the colonial domination of Britain, and the third war should reduce the world population to approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (a such number would provide for its amenities and luxury and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the pretext) and ultimately lead to the acquisition of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families works with the Rothschilds at the top is the solution of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order from chao - order from the chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the FED, so that crisiss such as those caused by them in 1907 are not repeated).
After the murder of the Habsburger Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo had succeeded in triggering the First World War, they destroyed the Russian Zarenreich by the Bolshevik Revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Zar kingdom), then the resolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary took place.
In order to simplify the Second World War, the bankers caused the policy to create a latent conflict situation by demonstrating Germany with gigantic war repairs, creating the precondition of deprived masses, so that they only had to jubile the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who offered the debted and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-popular state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which should take the function of a fifth column and also take in order to deploy the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, as far as possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as capital (Return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; it came to the first collapse with the resident Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler was from the chain of losriss at which the international bankers initially held him, or whether everything went on according to plan, it is only difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as was prepared by the war repairs against Germany for the Second World War, the provocation of the State of Israel represents the creation of the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers will succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be like the second world war to be a victim in the front line, this time together with the Arab or Muslim people of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of war and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also international (you only remember how sharply people are divided into followers and opponents of Israel).
Who is the guilty and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only causes injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power at the beginning?
Here we need to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, but the international bankers in Israel, as well as the people, choose only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fascism-advantaged politician who is loyal to international bankers who is doing everything to develop a war with Iran, which, given the membership of Iran in the Shanghai organization for cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly expand to a global conflict, and could lead to a destruction of the world economy because of Iran's control over only 2 miles of Hormus, over the 20% of the world's oil supply.
In what light appears the words of David Rockefellers from 1994: "The only thing we need is an all-reaching crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristokrates.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at the birth of a chip to subject this being to total control.
"And it makes that the little ones and the great ones, the riches and the poor, the free ones and the servants all give themselves a sign on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the sign, name of the beast, or number of his name.
Here is wisdom; whoever has understanding, consider the number of the animals.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty.
The movie Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
For their release, they demanded the delivery of the crashed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the U.S. after the revolution, who had preserved the patronate over his regime over decades.
For the U.S. government there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the shah overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was not able to carry out the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution introducing a theocratic regime.
It was a heavy blow for the reputation of the united states, and the subsequent Fiasko in the violent attempt of hostage liberation made everything even worse.
The diplomats captured were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been conducted by the Algerian government.
The fate of hostages cried out at home a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian moods.
The debakel in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo of the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this history that gave the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the message, six embassy workers escaped.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian Ambassador.
The CIA managed to bring refugees from Iran in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, helping them to cover their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports as members of a film stake that was said to visit the country's turning location for a science fiction film.
Combining the Genres
The plan developed by the expert for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also made the cooperation of Hollywood necessary.
In order to be credible, articles about this film project appeared in Fachzeitschriften, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept long secret. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic politthriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
In the film, the mood levels vary - on one side, the documentary scenes from Teheran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and there are no major differences in the filming of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly overhead.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA centre and other institutions - men in suits on the meeting table, on the office gap, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has succeeded in a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
From a belled actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the objective of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third film after the Crimea No children's game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thrill City without Grace (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film that doesn't play in the heated Boston of the director.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that the previous films of this director were taken from the standard Hollywoods.
However, this sense also proves to be in Argo, where Teheran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really occurred - the entry sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its summary, and still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
A similar effect with his team also results in fictional scenes (the wrong film stitch on a basar in Teheran).
Too much action in many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in a filmic sense.
But with the few, he works quite successful, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the threatening crisis at the airport in Teheran is turned off by a telephone in America, or also the persecution hunting on the startway, acts somewhat).
The weakness of Argo is its all too wide spread which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their figures would have earned more space, so they are far from alone in the movie.
Affleck's film thus loses a bit of train force. It is a film that you can track with some interest, with the design and the retro style that recalls a thriller from the 70th years.
However, enthusiasm makes it hard.
However, as a reminder of a living piece of history to this day and as a proof of how overwhelmed the ideas of the Almighty and All-Knowledge Secret Services, he is sufficient.
Guidelines for the launch of air balloons, bananas and circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, calling for an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided this year to organise the competition "Asurdest Regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"On this idea, the recently proposed EU plan to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European companies," said Patrik Nacher, who cares for the organisation of this survey, to the Právo newspaper.
Among the nominated deposits, for example, is the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed a benefit in life insurance because they are objectively a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible incidents from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place until the end of February 2013", informed Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations, among other things, the mandatory incorporation of bioethanol, which is naturally damaging, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or also the Directive on the size of chicken chicken chickens, which this year became substantially expensive.
In the past, criticism also raised the factual prohibition of the use of the term "butterstrich" or also the ban on sale for conventional glow bears.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU device often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented by one or more Member States in Brussels (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with veto threat).
lobby interests also argued that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not be "crumbling anomalia".
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it would only harmonize the unequal national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU's standards on fruit and vegetables have already weakened the resistance of some countries with the indication that the previous directives would lead to a waste of food.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU Regulation of last year, which, according to balloons, must be provided for sale indicating that children under eight years of age are not allowed to blow up the air balloon without an adult's supervision.
The EU refers to an American study, which, according to air balloons, is the leading cause of the death of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years in the use of annual market flows.
Curiose Invasions There are also at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns the European officials themselves - everyone who has an official role in the EU should not use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece, instead of saying FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, also nominated the EU Regulation on the scope of food supplies in the field of a Member State.
The EU thus established the maximum amount of food supplies that were allowed on the day of our EU accession in the Czech Republic.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the defined volume for mushroom conservations, which threatened us with a high penalty.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, or the idea of granting funds for applications for funding.
These ideas were, of course, not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will request reimbursement for the EU," said the then Minister for Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest had been very high and the state camps had been overfilled as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another way to seaports, the EU should pay hundreds of millions of euros to us according to Palas.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic so far that it organized a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
Funds for applications for funding offered the municipalities to the Ministry of Regional Development under the direction of Minister Pavel Němec (USD), in particular, should be funds for the establishment of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizar Regulations are the exception
However, in the Member States, regulations are easily becoming the target of criticism, the EU's efforts to regulate, and thus also for the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole, some experts consider it more worthy of recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding funds for projects that have nothing to do with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced in the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
Emotions also highlight the fact that the Czech Republic, like other Member States in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this struggle.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvaržky" after a six-year fight with Germany and Austria, the domestic rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition has returned to us until the 19th century, our manufacturers had to rename to "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for products of sugar pipe distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheese varieties Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or the Parmaschinn now also show up the Karlsbader Zwieback, carpings from Pohořelice and Třeboň, or also the Saazer Hopfen.
With an EU brand, the Pardubic live cakes or the Hořic roles can be broke.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, how is the idea of candidateing for the President's office?
I am not about being a senator or a president.
If everything worked in our country without problems, I wouldn't go anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the Republic has been plundered for 20 years, how thieves run free, while people increase taxes and pension age.
I had no ambitions to become politicians.
But if I see something that I do not like, then I try to suggest a solution to change this.
And since I'm over 40 years old, and I'm independent and unparty, I have no other way to influence things than to compete for the office of a senator or president.
In the Senate you have done it and then on the way to the castle.
Don't you turn your voters back?
I have told myself all the time that I will take up the battle for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
Later I clarified this and said that I would be candidate for the President's office if I was elected to the Senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realise my visions.
I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, shrink in the chicken and in front of the TV, but make everyone who wants to change something.
In addition, the media that want to rob you of honour and who confuse the freedom of the word with freedom to lie.
About me, for example, it was claimed that I would buy journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the struggle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive property declarations over 20 million crowns.
You need to change laws to do so.
As the President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I used to make the travel guide remain a free business, and this could be done.
The problem is the small-spirit politics - when someone comes from right or left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent unparty person, I have a far greater potential for gaining support to all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take what is best for our country without drawers and party dogs from every party.
Do you see yourself as a human in politics rather on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I think people's looking at me on the left.
For me, this right-left thinks is totally insignificant.
For me, it's important that we move on.
I am not about whether someone belongs to the left or the right camp; I want to connect people.
On all occasions, I publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or from the ODS, and I will also turn against bad ideas.
You'll be missed if someone calls you populists.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
If you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach this one.
This can be described as popularism for me, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without Parliament's support, you will remain only keywords.
And so you do not get far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to the people for a long time, you will succeed in ensuring, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other way.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to bring them to our side to achieve these goals.
As President, it would not be a problem for me to ask the Presidents of the Partys of Parliament live on television to announce the material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And the speakers should, if necessary, say why they reject this.
A strong personality pointing to misconstances can pressure the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, which was a merits of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started with politics and have tried to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it fails, I will return to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that I alone do not achieve anything, so I talked to several well-known personalities about whether they wouldn't like to join for the senate.
I spoke, for example, to Radim Jančura, who refused to work overload.
In addition, I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who discovered the fraud in the trade of light heating oil.
My candidateship began with the condition that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of the voters have not gone to the elections at all, and those who have gone have mostly chosen representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent ones.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will only be very difficult to implement.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district headmen.
Do you think about the establishment of a own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I have no time to check the past of any potential party member, nor have I the money for it at all.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign yet; on my transparent account are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You speak of property statements, how do you look?
I estimate my private assets at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague I have a property with a value of 25 million, an apartment for about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, as well as an aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Škodu superb worth about one million, and then I have a few million on the account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a children's dream - James Bond always liked me as he drove in the car, was galant to women and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a wealth of 60 million and don't have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not just convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make debts?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program doesn't seem to create too much interest.
And I'm not obliged to fight the campaign from my own means.
The cost of the campaign is actually covered by my salary as a senator.
But of the senator content alone, I could not live; for example, I could not finance my son the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be able to do anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to go back these activities?
But that does not relate to the height of salary.
As promised, I went back some of my activities.
For example, in spring my alternate becomes Managing Director of the travel agency.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live of something, too.
What monthly income were you used as an entrepreneur?
Some 200,000 to 400,000, and that is the same.
As the President, however, I would completely stop my business.
You will find the full discussion in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Buchberg - 2 photos
"I like the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a nearby large business, says, "But it's nice, the house."
But I wonder what we need to do today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No human being willingly enter one of these old-style libraries today, isn't it?
Spijkenisse, a hardly occupied sleeping town in front of the gates of Rotterdam, is an exceptional record holder.
The 80,000 residents community has the lowest rate of education in the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this foolish situation, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictional bridges that were represented on the euro bills as beautifully plastered steel concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to become the master of statistics: a library must come from here!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture Office MVRDV, master of great chicken bar charts and producers of funny, yes, often cynical buildings, took the matter with customary serenity and appeared to the competition hearing anno 2003 with five books under the arm and a grind face.
And while the jury still dulled around looking and snatched with the axis, the freak Maas stacked his read part of the size into a pyramid and closed his actionistly undermined speech with the words: "Dear town community!"
So that's him, my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euros of expensive mountains were furnished.
It is part of a revival project, which includes underground garage, supermarket, post and a few adjoining homes with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Buchberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This means the facial small town retorts, which until now had no more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a ruthlessly ugly town hall, behind whose white façades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory to richer a piece of contemporary architecture.
But, above all, Spijkeevents now have the first public culture building in the history of his existence.
The long way to book
The first impression: Bucheldorado under cheese locke.
Although there is an elevator that leads through the midst of the mountain mass, the true room and reading joys make up in the footing of topography.
The glazed interior is bright and overlooking, the burned clinger floor and the elegant street latterns speak the language of a public town square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already watching park bank, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the book shelves stand along the façade, and in the middle there is a large, dark space that is mostly inconvenient and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have put the classic space configuration on our head and rolled the reading area from inside to outside.
The inner of the Buchberg is used skillfully: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology centre.
A special joy are the black book shelves that sometimes are wall coverings, once bursts, times stitching lands.
Optics, haptics and smell are strange.
Even inflicted architects and construction engineers shaken the head of the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, on request of the standard.
And so, one day, in a Friesland farm, we hit a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in the Netherlands, a millimetre of plastic filament is used in greenhouses and on fields as a root material.
That's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile holds one, two seasons, afterwards it is ripe for the locking waste.
For the library, the fles - for the first time in these quantities - were pressed to four inches thick plates.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Agricultural Plastic (KLP) becomes a dark, homogeneous, stressable material that smells a bit to new cars and an bissl to sports shoe.
After 105 stages you reach the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500 meters long hiking, you will be rewarded in the literature café not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch crokettes and incubated Ficus trees.
They provide for atmosphere, but especially for the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is a show project in puncto ecology despite the many glass surfaces," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with earth heat.
Although the bookberg is under a glass collapse, even on sunny days the sun appears only shortly inside.
The wide wooden blades that stand across to the glass facade serve as shade and catch a large part of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
Completely automated rollos are done to the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptician from the IT industry, already waged the way to the new books.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And the TCM Teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even describes the Buchenberg as a spyker's "last surpassing soul".
The reason: To open a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal stock.
This aims first to fill the optical gaps in the library that is not yet fully covered - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has come up.
The shelves are filled upstairs.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just the scenery.
MVRDV has succeeded in the king's discipline called identity foundation in the jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literature history.
So young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally an approach to identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany has abstained from the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in US-European relations, Berlin thus balances at a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week Germany had first signaled that it would vote against the request for an observer status of the Palestinians with the United Nations.
But then there was Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful due to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate his independence - without however being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the vote when it was about setting up a flight ban zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is just changing its foreign policy away from a policy managed by the US to a German foreign policy.
It is difficult to say that the Europeans have no coherent and uniform policy.
The Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still in touch with their role, but they are on the way to a "normaler" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as they have France or Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It shows the willingness to take positions in national interests which are independent of the US or European partners.
I believe that the German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. from exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain degree different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to overthrow the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
In any case, this plays a role.
But I wouldn't want to measure too much weight, that's not a completely unilateral relationship.
But in any case, it plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA by abstaining from the vote on important decisions, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the USA there is a great understanding of the German position.
That's why I don't think that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even play a certain respect.
Because it signals that as an international player it must be taken seriously and its interests must be considered.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences between the US and many European nations?
Due to American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama in secret has quite much understanding of the European position.
However, because of the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, represent this position publicly.
I believe that the real disagreements are not as big as they always appear.
If you look at the relationships between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanjahus politics.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and on the other hand, with the position of the most important partners in the EU?
I think that makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and instead have to drive things out of their own position.
They're just doing this with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in putting Europe into a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, already because of the relationship with Israel.
That has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think the German is clear that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany itself see as an important international player - does Germany want to take a major role?
Or does Germany still fall the leadership role?
Germany is still not accustomed to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
For example, when we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings will be free.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That's actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this regard, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be sensitive to various neighbors and opinions, and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European policy is constantly diminishing, but the EU does not fill this vacuum at the moment, who else remains there?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even though they do not like it, it is unpleasant to them and makes them much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what's Armani Polo?
Thereafter, a very officially registered name is hidden in China, which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, she enjoys protection as long as the actual nameholders do not complain.
And even then it's not clear if they get right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer at the Taylor Wessing Office, who specializes in protective violations in Fernost.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters so they can register their brands.
So from Gucci just Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you let Prada-Kny enter.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries of the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was able to protect the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese world champions are in copying and in injured intellectual property is known.
In the large cities there are multi-storey shops that almost exclusively sell counterfeitings.
But Pattloch's cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he assumes that Chinese companies are officially entitled to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call the "Bang Mingpai", a coach brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who approach rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt
"This is business damage, you have to fight it," asks Pattloch.
"The brand is watered, the all-setting disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the process costs of the sectors concerned are the millions, especially in the case of expensive products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market in luxury products and the fastest growing volume of EUR 15 billion in the year.
However, removals of dubios entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
Up to nine years the procedure can take place, with uncertain results.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court refused complaints because after the long duration of the objectioned name had become a "marketuality".
If the applicant had Pech, he had to pay the plagiator even because he injured his brand in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes there is the jungle's law here.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a dispute with the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump builder Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use a emblem that is similar to the Mercedes Star until today.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-white logo that reminded BMW; the dispute was settled, Yellowy had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any debt.
The brand office CTMO in Beijing admits that there have been shortcomings in 2010 because of the lack of staff and room facilities.
Last year, however, "the emergency situation in the workflow has returned to normality".
Thus, the stock of unprocessed opposition procedures was reduced by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 claims are still waiting for completion in the office.
Against this, much costs
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost one third more than 2010.
This is a record and means that China is presenting the list of new applications in all over the world for the tenth time, the Authority notifies.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, Yuan had been charged for 1.8 billion.
Simplified means that each application costs 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
On the other hand, a multiple costs, as shown by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the Group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiator.
While the Germans were able to achieve that their illegal factorying of imitated automotive parts was lifted.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights at the Brand Freudenberg.
You have missed this yourself because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office CTMO rejected the opposition of the Munichs.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg got right, but the opponent of the process continues to fight.
You have to be careful.
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionality of the courts.
But he also says: "The process is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs were hardly comparable, the company archive had even had to see a hundred years old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite in vain a "high six-digit euro amount" to be deposited.
"There you see how much we value that," says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fernost are even threatening to weaken back to Europe.
Then if imitaters secure unprotected brands there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to sign up the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
This business field has long abandoned the Group, but it could refrain from registering.
"You have to be careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather the foreigners should "all that is worth protecting, also register in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, this can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, it is likely that the opposite one should pay license fees for his own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Aid Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS is delighted.
The history of a connection that overcomes far more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the stumping: cowboys boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and men's lippers looking for the tact on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
First, the voices of the singers slowly swell on - old, bass, tenor and soprano - cheating, betraying and persecuting.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he brings them together with his lush wild gestures.
It's Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi is trying a new song.
The fifty singers have arrived, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choir voice has another text and it is still in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Assistance to Self-Help
There are around 34 million HIV infected people around the world, which is estimated to be Unaids, the United Nations programme for the fighting of AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 AIDS are living.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS in the village of Esitjeni, the Association has found Voices for Africa Paten in Germany.
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can accept a patriarchy.
She guarantees school money, school uniform and a warm meal daily in the Gogo center.
Imbongi means to Zulu storytellers or also praise praisers.
The bantu language flowing can no one in this room but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practising in this foreign soft language and brings them back from and from where they originate: in the south of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, dependent on the voting force of the German chore.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw cottages, most of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no more parents, because they are engaged in the HI virus.
In Esitjeni there is little evidence of what is ill throughout Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
The population hardly assumes cutting of male precautions, which prove to reduce the risk of infection by half.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immune weakness virus in themselves, dying in the middle of thirty is not rare.
At a joint African journey in spring 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all the imbongis saw many children on the streets, not only lacking parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school graduation, there is no chance in a poor country.
At first it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal every day.
However, a year later, the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which since then cares almost professionally for the Aids-Waisen in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
The bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhö).
Common viral STI are HIV, Human Pappilomaviren, Herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
False and crates belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main stakeholder groups?
Syphilis and trippers occur mainly with men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five of the syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted by sexual contacts between men.
In the heterosexual adults, chloride infections, trichomonads, candidosis, trippers and human pappiloma viruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in this area - yet, approximately 20 percent of HIV new infections are related to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, there are common human cardiovascular viruses in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has increased from 1697 diseases in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were some 2700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What symptoms suggest a sexual illness?
Infection diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, urinating complaints, flows, underbuilt pain, blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide a hundred percent protection.
In part, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smirn infections and close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular investigations, especially in the case of frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosed, most STI can be healed and avoided late effects.
Through patriarchs, donations and, not least, the Gagen who sings the choir throughout Germany come together.
"In total, we have already sent around EUR 200 000 to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, Chairman of the Association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-conscious and enforceable woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also cares for the orphans to be well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they call the old women on Zulu, are the supporters of the village.
Some of them have taken up up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children appear on time in their uniforms every day for school lessons.
If you don't have any more, you come to the protective house at Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club as well as the two chefs who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized together with the American Health Organization PSI that many in the village have made a HIV test.
This is not a natural thing, for as obviously the disease throughout the country is, it is most popularly dead.
A King with 14 Wives
"Aids is an absolute tabu," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially holds 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this stately sanctified form of life that the HI virus has spread so rapidly over the past decades.
But also the many hiking workers who carry the virus through the country.
Free condoms would be on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
Culture is another - flesh to flesh."
In order to promote cultural exchanges, the Imbongi choir travels through South Africa every two, three years together and sings songs full of weeping, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many still know on the southern zip of the black continent from times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has already put some wrathful border soldiers down a few tears.
The journey also takes you to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their paternal children.
Even though you hardly find the small village on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there's the light," the people say there.
And when you return the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, to the stamping singers in the sample room on the Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shine there.
Messenger: NASA discovered ice on the Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Merkur.
The ice ceiling may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has demonstrated the existence of ice on the planet Merkur.
Although it is next to the sun, there is also frozen water there, as shown from three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The Sonde Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice ceiling in the planet's permanently in the shadowed region.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or asteroids that have been hit on the mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger Son, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached in other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's citizens, probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are investigating the depths of the world.
From time to time, they send pictures to earth: Little guck holes in infinite ways.
The picture comes from a camera that has developed German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, also the dwarfplanet Ceres.
As Pluto, who creates behind Neptun around the sun, Ceres is not a "planet" after the new definition of the International Astronomy Union in 2006.
This image section of an infrared recording of the top telescope shows a "family portrait" of unzähled star generations: the oldest stars are identified as blue points, more difficult to identify the pink-coloured "newborn" in the star circle hall.
This staring region - called unromantically W5 by scientists - has discovered the telescope Spitzer in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light years.
This shiny glute of a dying star has taken the top telescope of the Nasa.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material that the star swallowed out in the death process.
In the huge Trifid Nebel, 5400 light years away from the earth, new stars are produced from gas and dust.
The topr telescope of the Nasa shot this photo of the galactic birth show.
The Plejade Star Hope, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
With the telescope, however, the colors are better applied.
Like an age of red, the Helix Nebel looks forward to the viewer on this infrared photo.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius star image.
His similarity with an earthly continent introduced this fog the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures spectacular coloring.
This baby star could only be recorded in his full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and his rings: As these have come about, is one of the great mysterys of astronomy.
Perhaps they are the remains of a Saturn month, which disappeared unquestionably 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and tightest recordings of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool galaxy
Depending on coloring, recordings of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The recording published by the European South Star Guard shows the trifid nebula in the constellation shelter of several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (dreided, three-split), as dark dust stripes divide the glowing heart of the star-burial site.
In the constellation of snakes, astronomers have photographed the pre-bodies of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years away from the earth are racing the cores of two melting galaxies together and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star-birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the Spiral Galaxie M83.
Who does not lie to technical abbreviations, she may call her nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the space telescope Hubble shows an excerpt from the Irisnebel in the constellation of Kepheus.
The 1400 light years away fog consists of dust grains, which are ten to hundred times smaller than ordinary dust.
This picture was merged from optical and x-ray recordings of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, took the space telescope Hubble for the Nasa.
The larger spiral galaxy calls scientists UGC 1810.
In this star foam is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star scale always produces new youngsters.
Also these star clouds, coupled with the Rose-Nebel, brings out ongoing new baby stars - 5000 light years away from the earth.
In this bright radiant galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, but only gas.
Researchers suspect that it was created only shortly after the original knall, when it was mainly hydrogen in the universe.
Our Insights to the All: The most important telescopes
The telescope was supposed to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown increasingly - and the insights they provide are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope was the largest telescope in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Great Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into the all equally above two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The inner life of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is tightened in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the height angle.
His speciality: the high light collecting power.
This, despite comparatively low mirror diameter, reaches the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to the all for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
The search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) can help each computer owner by providing computation.
View of the Observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope - which makes his name all honor.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also lighten the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned on the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be filled with 42 meters - and made up of nearly 1000 mirror elements.
However, pictures can be expected at the earliest of 2018.
By 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors each with an average of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which, next to them, looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea is to create a new, huge telescope - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be magnified on an illustration.
The most important impressions from the All, however, provide the space telescope Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it has already delivered pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets - mainly for those who are inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, Nasa announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the beginning of the mission.
In the picture, the latest start preparations are documented on the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is shot on board an Ariane5 missile in 2018.
The primary level of space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: It is supposed to search for light from the first stars and galaxies for the original knall.
Scientists assume that there is also on the South Pole of Mercury ice.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as the messengers create far closer to the North Pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on the Mercury.
Through the 2004 Messenger Son - the first to crawl around the Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and get 168 years old
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people reach a Biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A track search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch mountain is called wildromantic.
The small bus rolls over the spacious road, passing nearly forested hills, ripping rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border to Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian people's group of Talysh, which is not much known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian and Aserian and is very long-lasting.
Endstation is Lerik.
The small town is proud of overwhelming architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit in the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe barely come here, too difficult is the approach of Azerbaijan's capital Baku.
For the 323 kilometres you need eight hours, because the road is only single.
The splendid wealth that the country owes its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku was famous with the Eurovision-Song Festival in May - and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum for Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita is documented by about eight dozen talytics from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva shows on a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
A child was born at the age of 136.
But the controversial star of the museum is the sheep shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is supposed to have become 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And in view of the oldest documented person who was 122 years old, Müslümov's age appears very doubtful.
"1805 he was born here in the region, in 1973 he died," said Fatulayeva.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he was told to have begotten a daughter.
So, has Şirali Müslümov been decades old?
But Rembrandt Scholz, age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high-aged in Central Asia.
"There are also striking many high-aged people in some areas of China, Japan or Hunza valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia, many very old men live."
However, because of the lack of documents, it is not necessary to provide scientific evidence of age, especially when the status register was missing.
Every day bleached butter
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik are strikingly often attaining Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
So why are so many high-aged people living here in the south?
The Asian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is the diet.
But that the calorie-rich food of the talytics is supposed to be so healthy that loves meat, bread and especially milk products and many of them drink a glass of melted butter daily, even from a scientific point of view, is not plausibly plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that people keep young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Kaukasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butter barrel that she rolls on and down.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both are long since grandparents.
Two little children also jump around.
In the kitchen you will prepare the guests of tea served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayevas white teeth are perfectly in row and slide, under her head cloth she hides long, dark blonde heads that her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, they never went out of me and kept their color.
"Shampoo I never used," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She's always eaten only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, herbs.
I haven't bought food for my whole life once in the supermarket.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the time after World War II.
But everything got better than the "loved father" Heydar Aliyew took over the row.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the fatheral figure of the nation, who ruled his land as a dictator, knows little limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, later his son Ilham took over the row.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan's old ones.
230 Manat (e.g. the same sum in Euro), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, for the local conditions a amount of which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas has long since been rough, son: "The old ones enjoy high esteem in our culture."
They live in the midst of the large family, are loved, cared for, and are happy.
If that is no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "people law" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rivalent explosions in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future Constitution with the Scharia as a basis is severely controversial.
The Egyptian president didn't spare with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that he succeeds is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but especially to the Christian Kopts, the Liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because they all, hopelessly clashed in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God at the Nile of Graces of the Mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He, said Mohammed Mursi almost apologizes, temporarily cut down the competences of the Constitutional Court and expanded his competences "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctoral title of the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are about it, the world is not quite clear.
Should the Judicative be dismissed?
In fact, the 234 articles that have been pierced by the islamistly dominated 100-member constitutional assembly there are partially distressing in a nightly, 15-hour parforcerite.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the jurisdiction is based on the "principes of Islamic law".
But what's "principes"?
That was and is interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the swimming formulation and the corresponding legal scope for a more stringent interpretation of the Scharia.
This suggests at least a newly added article: In all matters relating to Scharia, the Al-Ashar University must be consulted, the most important Islamic institution of the country with great radiation throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it may mean that the clergy supervises legislation, which would have resulted in de facto dismissal of the judiciary.
A lot of the draft draft interpretation is
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to remain.
These courts served during Mubarak’s reign to suppress oppositional ones.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military prison.
The state should also, it is in the design, "protect the real being of the Egyptian family" and promote their morality and values.
This is legally so unwholesome that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature by using this article.
In plain text, this means nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article expressly determines the equality of men and women.
For this, another forbids to insult or slander the prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it is to be honored remains unclear.
In the same way, dubios encourages the wording that the "insult of human beings" is prohibited.
Is there already a cartoon of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
Interpretation, as many things will be presented in Mursi's draft for signature and, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians for the people's vote.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been formed against the overpower of the Islamists for weeks.
Tens of thousands gathered on Friday evening on the Tahrir Square in Cairo in unintentional engagement and praised to bring the Charter to fall, even before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will victory," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential elections.
Nobel of Peace Prizes and Ex-Chef of the International Atomic Energy Authority Mohamed El-Baradei said that the draft Constitution was "to the garbage mountain of history".
Through short news service Twitter, he claimed the followers of Mursis to want to lead a "putsch against democracy".
"When he calls out the referendum, we will go to his palace and crash him," said the opposing Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet reconciled," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Chaled Ali.
And several judges announced not to want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim brotherhood blew to the local demonstration, but not on the Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer before the Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists took part in it and called: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They asked Mursi: "Super the land!" and rebuked: "The Quran is our constitution."
A struggle for the Highness over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything took its beginning, would probably have sworn up civil war-like states.
Obviously, Mursis followers didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim brothers explained that both the opponents of the Constitutional Draft and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the election hours in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists' draft is considered safe.
"The word of human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually have gone until February and should involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old Human Rights Attorney and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brothers when they were imprisoned under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their world views, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For that he was crushed, sentenced, imprisoned.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in conversation with the "World on Sunday".
Mursi Power expansion to all three forces in the state resigned to the lawyer.
These measures are horrible violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President set it out de facto," Saeda complains.
However, democracy could not work without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels left alone, also from the international community that views the ideological direction struggle at the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could be revengeable.
A demonstration on the Tahrir warns: "You are giving a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is that the worst fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life - not only in Europe, but throughout the world.
Could the country's secrecy have something to do with the local appetite on fairly vile fish?
Take a selection of overriding cheese varieties.
They are placed in the middle of a hip of dirty, moist sports clothing.
And beat them there for a week.
It is about to imagine Rakfisk, one of the great delicates in Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectacular landscapes here - and this sturdy smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-bearing trout that - depending on how stinking one would like his fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When the darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather becomes colder, Norweger flows to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this really very brilliant speciality.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire guard, but as a so-called "Rakfisk-General", also organizes the festival.
Around us, people eat small fish cube and take large amounts of alcohol to themselves.
"Mans like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk," said Havard.
Spirituosis can penetrate the smell.
I'll take some chickens.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near the nose, it's not bad - like Sushi, who has a quite long bus trip behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian epoch, when there were no cooling options yet and fish was drowned in autumn in airproof salt water vessels.
In the deepest winter, he was taken out after long fermentation and, undoubtedly, with the help of alcohol defeated senses, was consumed.
Even before a generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and were mainly migrated to the United States.
Today, the population grows rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and a comprehensive health sector.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was not too long ago far richer than Norway, immigrants flowed.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important - as an essential, though strictly smelling part of Norwegian history.
He's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually, it's all expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs proud 10 euros.
Norway does not often make it into the world press, and most people do not seem to disturb it.
Here you still hate to call Anders Breivik - those racist legal extremists, the last year 77 men, women and children shot.
Instead, one refers only to the "Event of July 22".
Norwegians are hard to accept that someone in their peaceable country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries has been principally responsible for Norway's present wealth.
"But oil isn't the only reason why we are so good," says Anna, our cellar woman, who distributes round tablets with mature rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and the steaking blue eyes.
We're a cautious people, as we say.
Your English is just like that of most people here.
We're not very incredible, we don't like stumbling.
Norway has been very careful with its oil richness - a large part of the sector's revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When, in the years to the world economic crisis, everyone was thrown around with money that they did not possess, Norway held its money exchange firmly.
"As long as we can ski in winter and walk in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with uncomfortable laughter.
I'm standing in the snow and standing up for another court -- by Rakfisk I have enough.
That's something different. The juicy meat muggs me.
But in the evening the stink fish is back on the plan.
The hotel in which I log is one of several places of events that organize a Rakfisk dinner, where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most outrageous - fish.
There is a live TV circulation to a flying showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The spectacle resembles the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have at the top of the mountains for the best fish, Thor boys?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
You smile and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by aquavit.
But maybe it's the strict tin of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing difficult start
While Mexico's future President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing for his office, Will Grant from the BBC analyses the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is a always constipated city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that locks several important road routes to the capital and provides chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to interfere with pupils on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the president's bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's facing a complex task.
Under the separating government of Felipe Calderon, Mexico has been able to manage economically, but the country is under the control of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 people in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," said Pena Nieto at the beginning of this week at the Oval Office to the U.S. President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto was the governor of his home country of Mexico.
In this densely populated part of the country that surrounds the capital, the opinions about the new Head of State are divided.
A direct man
In the small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, you will be happy to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that made Pena Nieto build and which represent a great improvement compared to the breachy, hollow streets that there were once here.
Plates with its name hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum for climate change.
"We expect real and persistent changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who is a Congressman for the Pena Nietos Party who works PRI.
In particular, as regards security and economy, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was dissolved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congress member Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has great expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the accusations of the opposition, the new president lacking substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent stateman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other hand of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The town is hidden under motorway transfers and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year the military was set up to combat the drug bands operating in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot of Brachland near a large garbage deposit, only over the last two years, the bodies have been left with more devastating murdered women.
During the term of office of governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistics that even exceeds the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is infamous for their violence and murders of innocent women.
The critic Pena Nietos considers that he has not addressed at least the problem of women's murder during his term of office.
But in the worst case, his government closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the downstairs quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her lifemate.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," Senora Buendia recalls.
There were indications that she was beaten, and the corpse had already used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is fitted next to a cross that wears a single word: justice.
But this one, says the family, has been denied her until now.
The authorities treated me as if I were a mocket, annoyer, Nörglerin.
They just want to accept their judgment and keep their mouths.
"But that's not possible if there were so many form errors and failures," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the president's bond on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been suffering from violence over the last six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term of office.
"I hope he is as President as he was governor," says PRI Congress member Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
The prosecutor claims that Bradley Manning did not complain about abuse
The prosecutor's prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning's accusations that he had been abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence aims to reject the claim due to hard detention conditions
The liberator of the US Army is accused of having escaped thousands of confidential documents
On Friday, the prosecutor tried to note that the armies-free Bradley Manning - accused for the greatest unveiling of confidential information in the US history - failed to complain about the abuse he claimed in military prison.
During a cross-interrogation Mannings during a pre-judicial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden Fine that documents on weekly visits that the prison officials had made during Manning's nine-month prison in Quantico, Virginia, did not have any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the interrogation, which was held as a result of a request for defence to reject the charge - Manning had already been punished by the hard prison period - Manning had said that he had considered the suicide in prison.
The secret service analyst of the U.S. Army, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stolen thousands of confidential documents in Iraq during his service time.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
During the hearing on Friday, Fein went through the forms that officials had completed after meeting with Manning during his detention in the Quantico Military Prison, where he had attended from July 2010 to April 2011 under strengthened detention conditions.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote his answers.
When fine asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment through his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a "very professional".
The forms, said fine, did not contain any complaints about abuse, although the officials asked Manning directly for his treatment.
Maning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally, and the officials had discussed them with him and told them to deal with them, but they were not logged.
"They wrote "No problems" (after discussion of concerns), and that did not necessarily mean that I didn't say anything at all," said Manning.
The judge, Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 that would examine the suicide ideas he mentioned a few months earlier on a form.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to "prevention of injuries".
The military said that it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one stage under the risk of suicide - to his and to the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good for me, and get rid of the observation status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
On Thursday, Manning issued his arrest and detention to Kuwait, where he was held nearly two months before he was transferred to the Marine Base Quantico Prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and had once become unconscious because of the heat.
Not to know what happened to him or to the outside world was stressful.
"My world shrinks on Camp Arafjon, on this cage together," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cage.
When he was moved to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
You only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion, because the day whether it was forbidden to sleep or just add to it.
He had to sleep with light from the outside into his cell.
If he had turned around at night and he couldn't see his face again, he was awakened to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally opposed the treatment of Mannings.
In April 2011 Manning was moved to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge Manning also asked for an accusation he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico at a morning counting naked before guards and other prisoners.
Manning had said that he had never had the opportunity to wrap himself with his blanket during this counting.
During the survey on Friday, Manning said that he had closed out of a command of his guard that he should have dropped the blanket with which he could have covered. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had said that he was forced to sleep naked the night before. He had tried to show an official that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the official that he could have used the covenant of his underaches or his flip flops to injure himself, but not.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take account of his imprisonment experiences and drastically reduce his detention, he should be sentenced in his trial before the military court, which is set up for the beginning of next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will confess itself less offence for guilty, while other charges that are considered too extreme are to be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is planned for this weekend. The prosecutor is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning was held in accordance with the provisions applicable to all prisoners stored under the highest safety provisions in Quantico.
The objections against Manning include the favor of the enemy, the unlawful publication of secret information on the Internet, the transmission of national defence information and the thievery of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty in all the charges, he threatens a lifelong imprisonment.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to accuse the immigrants - they call them to memory severe times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at the passport control when incitement spread in me.
Shields referred to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexikaner"), another for "Extranjeros".
I was there for a few seconds, uncertain to which I should go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexikaner" for my whole life.
An ethnic shortcut - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later I chose to "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home there was no need for shortcuts or bindings.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to claim myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going to get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the snake for Extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda were all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy. It is a reason for Mexicans staying today with equal probability in Mexico instead of migrating to the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block in the example of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he did not mention details in this regard.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought about the United States' entry into Mexico in 1848 and forced the leadership of the country under preserved gun to leave them more than half their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event cannot be overlooked.
So once an U.S. government official exercises only the mildest criticism of Mexico, in the Mexican press and among the elites of the country, one hears complaints about how the Americans are harassing the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas go on the war path.
And yet the biggest challenge of Mexico is in truth in relation to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Would you like to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for which the country offers opportunities, and others for which it does not do this.
The only reason why so many people live of Mexico's origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was not offered a chance in Mexico and moved to the north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And although we may now live the American dream, have visited schools and received good jobs, we should never forget that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican.
Our identity may sometimes be vain, but as for our loyalty, this is not the case.
This clearly applies to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class do not like us.
This is based on mutuality.
They see us as a monument of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our bands to Mexico will never be strong enough.
They believe that our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not see ourselves caught behind the silk curtain, with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigration legally into the United States, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans are taking them this badly.
While she is a U.S. citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they are neither one nor another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as an American.
And in the United States we are seen as a Mexican.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of education citizenship want to reopen their connections to Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provisional "Botschafter" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and press on political leadership to intensify its commitments to Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And in view of the unjust distribution of income, unrestricted corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure whether it really is a great country.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to go alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for the treatment of Mexico aged about one and a half centuries ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans are resentful about how their family members have not been treated so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're "mexicaler" than I thought.
Old Fights, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected fundamental pillar for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to embarrass such a hope in the germ.
In the middle of the usual debt assignments, countless buildings were laid in shade and ashes, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza were hit near the Israeli metropolis Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be caught in their historical conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these wires.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to assume that the deadly Patt situation could finally end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism in view of the current situation seems all other than appropriate.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21, this week's fights have strengthened the hardweeds on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement, which has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim by themselves to have pushed Israelis back, although his group had to suffer great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are imprisoned in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has not yet succeeded in destroying the Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Yugoslavia, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group of Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could conclude that they have the time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, the Hamas have been able to draw powerful and rich friends on their side.
Turkey, a resurrecting regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken hold of the Hamas Party, just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic golf states.
Judging Hamas adherent believes that around Israel is a Islamic half-moon - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant Hisbollah has the power, about Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamic shape could stand before the rush of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular the rise of the Muslim brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - the most indigenous and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laizist despot that ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time left for the Hamas.
In contrast, the brotherhood with the Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on national views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor who cannot be pushed out by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw a contradictory conclusion.
Militaryly, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, "Iron Dome", has been able to overcome and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States holds its position firmly. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence scales.
Israel has experienced it well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process in large parts.
Although missiles from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide victims - not least thanks to the locking plants that have been extended to the West Bank and thus to the main part of a possible Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared to be unlawful for human rights.
Netanyahu stands well there. His Likud party joined Avigdor Lieberman in front of the elections on 22 January with an even more fighting group.
Why do these stupid Palestinians also hate and leave them their own state?
If they really had control over the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their co-fighters in the Gaza Strip?
No, it's better to keep them in chess and punish them behind the wall, they should dare to lift their heads.
Maybe the hardlines will be able to work out, but the Arab spring could make them a strike through the bill.
Even if the Islamists who now sit on power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will first concentrate on the difficulties in their own country.
The defense set of Israel is greater than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to restore their economy.
The fact that Pragmatic President Mursi joined Barack Obama in order to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world takes tremendous steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their self-determination law - a powder fiber that will undoubtedly explose one day in the Israeli occupied areas, just as this week a bus exploded in Tel Aviv.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only strengthen this situation.
Bloody missions to push the Hamas back in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand their diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an offense from outside
The correct answer is those represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel departs for security purposes.
The hope - for the near future small - is that the ceasefire will give more influence to foreigners to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, has to stop the supply of weapons in the Gaza Strips and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state on the basis of the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outstanding Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be more for the creation of a Palestinian State than for the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute to moving Israel into negotiations.
During his first term of office, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the white house it seems as if he was also dismissed of a participation.
But this is a regrettable, short-looking perspective.
The United States has a significant interest in a stable Middle East.
And there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian legislation on single cigarette packaging enters into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs equal to all tobacco brands
The first laws for uniform cigarettes and tobacco packaging worldwide have entered into force in Australia. This will replace trademark logos and colors with neutral, olive-green covers, which are also printed with drastic images that show sick body parts and infants and children who are infected by cigarette smoke.
Of the different health warnings and images once, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, printed in identical, small text, is from Saturday onwards.
Australia thus introduces the most stringent arrangements for tobacco packaging worldwide.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of tobacco consumption.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at the age of 26 will no longer begin with 99% probability afterwards.
"You can already see in children young age that they understand the message of applying tobacco companies with their brand image," said Bundesgesundheitsminister Tanya Plibersek. She quotes studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the least smoker rates in the world and the changes will only have a minor impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby harshly fought against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and easier-to-access cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have stimulated their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for cigarettes and silicone covers has risen enormously since the companies British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed two months ago at the Supreme Australian Court of Justice.
Zico sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale businesses and waited for new stocks.
This is a good business for us.
According to experts, the hook is in the popularity of social media with exactly the population group addressed by the plan.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from the TV advertising, forbid them to act as sports sponsors and forced most dealers to stop interpreting cigarettes in shops. Now the tobacco advertising has changed to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Whoever sells tobacco and has only a small area left to apply its products does not come around the Internet," says Becky Freeman, health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has found an increase in experience reports on brands written by "all normal people".
One must ask himself: Is this just a private person who finds such a great pleasure in Marlboro cigarettes that she even records a video for it - or has a marketing agency to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that rather than marketing, the industry focuses on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to fight the new regulations - those countries complain to the World Trade Organisation about unjust trade restrictions, although none of the countries is making greater trade with Australia.
WTO decision is expected for mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has conducted discussions with other countries which consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
In the meantime, these have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers show themselves indifferent.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just ignoring it.
"You just take a chop and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box on which a photo is printed with a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in the city center of Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill its shelves.
"Before I used an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government should have forbidden cigarettes completely - then we would have told ourselves okay, that's it, we're closing," he obviously adds outrageously.
In a constantly elected world it is nice to be bored even once
This Thanksgiving I spent unexpectedly five hours at the airport when our plane was due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to make a few thoughts about boring.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting for a flight for half a day at the airport is quite nervous - even when books, magazines and iPhones are available (and of course tax-free shopping).
But more and more academics and child development experts lead boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is for us - and our children - okay to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thoughts, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are staring almost constantly on one or other screen today, we are no longer benefiting from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I'll get back to that again.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively current phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not think so.
"At fact, the boredom has a very long story," he says.
The house walls of Pompeji decorate a Latin graffiti over boredom, which goes back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associated professor of psychology at the University of Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of research literature and the presentation of the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that Langeweile can be defined as the experience of "using a satisfactory activity but not to be able to do so".
Suffering differs from apathy as a result of the fact that the person is not busy but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no urge to do something.
The key experience of the boredom, he says, is in a "disruption of the attention process, coupled with bad mood and the feeling that time is slowly over".
Sorrow can sound almost as depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions might be related, people who are bored seeing the problem in their surroundings or the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are boring, even if we only have difficulty concentrating on ourselves.
In her study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German, for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of Langeweile under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a band on which one person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room, which had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at low volume, so it was hardly perceived, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
Those who hardly heard the audible television reported to feel more boredom than the two other groups - they had problems concentrating, could not find any reason for them and attributed their difficulties of boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or struggling task, the disturbance of attention can lead to boring, says Mark J. Fenske, associated professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if one exercises a one-tone activity - "such as the search for defective products on a factory conveyor band, music can be diverted and helping to avoid being bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that herdsapples and crawls, often interpreted as signs of boredom, can even fight them by staying physically more attentive.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to migrate learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," says Professor Fenske.
We all get boring at some point - my late flight, a drowning loudspeaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people are more bored than others.
In order to measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scala of longevity".
On the scale there are statements such as "Many things I have to do, repeat yourself and are monotone" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
By means of such scales, researchers have found that young people become more boring than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of Westflorida - in particular as regards the need for more and greater diversity of external irritation.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty cutting pitch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of the adolescents in school and doing their homeworks were bored, whereas 23% reported to be bored when they were not at school.
But only 3% of the parents claimed to be bored.
Today, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he doesn't know whether the percentages have risen or decreased in terms of boredom.
However, he is sure that "the youth is particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have a major influence on their everyday course.
So back to my question of origin: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling into gambling or drugs to relieve them - that has shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who has been investigating the topic for more than two decades.
"With the boring, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what to do the best.
If you're boring and you use this energy to play and cook guitar, you'll be happy.
However, television can make a short-term sense of happiness, but they are reluctant in the long term.
Thus, those who have enough iPad for their bored child can disrupt it from the boredom. However, it has not learned to entertain or control themselves, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self control is transferring from one situation to the other."
The child not only learns to talk but also gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
We shouldn't see them too critically.
Instead, our goal should be to feel us well apart from continuing activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like being more boring to us, but boring is the painful, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people in truth are only looking for a way, turning off and relaxing.
"In an environment in which we are constantly exaggerated, it is difficult to deal with once the noise is dampened."
In Colorado there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old Community College Student and footballer Anthony Orozco stands in the southeast of Colorados for a crime before court that will soon be legal in this state: the possession of some fewer marijuana breaks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends traveled on one September day by car in Lamar near the border of Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer had found Marihuana in the car, Orozco was invited for the possession of drugs and drug outsilis - cavalier offences, each with a penalty of $100 - and received a court term.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he one too?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small quantities of marijuana for self-use, the answer for hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of disregards that turn around marijuana are already dropped here and in the State of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 years for possession to a small extent. This is permitted by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorados have announced continuing to follow existing marijuana offences and still quote people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, agree to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from opening in their municipalities.
"This situation develops so quickly that I do not know what will happen next," says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulatory authorities in the state of Washington also scratch their heads.
They are waiting for a guidance aid for the establishment of a license system for production, production, distribution and sale of the drug, and have in mind a deadline until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is believed that Colorado is in every case ahead of most states as regards the regulation of marijuana, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for its own use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market. The state is therefore good for orientation," says Brian E. Smith, speaker of the Supervisory Authority for Spirituosen in Washington State.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington Act, called I-502, enters into force on 6 December and thus forms the endpoint of a gray zone in which, although the state license system is not yet existed, the property is legalized.
And unpleasant practice issues must be clarified at this time - for example, how the state's requirement of "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana is to be agreed with the prohibition of cannabis businesses around 300 meters around schools, parks, playgrounds and children's care facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle Balling Area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent his employees in Aurora an e-mail in which he explained that the prosecutor would no longer pursue smaller marijuana offences in persons over 21 years, and that the police would not seek "from now on" any penalties for these offences.
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce urban requirements for regulating farmers of medical marijuana and would continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in the north of Colorados, district attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After voting, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to move consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 persons have to be responsible for the possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana before the court, although many have also been charged for other offences.
"Our authority is obliged to pursue infringements that were criminal offences at the time of the act," said Buck in a statement.
The reactions are even in places such as the rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the Marihuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the district, no longer show adults for the possession of smaller quantities.
District prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership procedures.
"I don't think I waste my time to enforce the right until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of the voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to compatible the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexities of government and legal systems.
And the contradictory reactions throughout the state promoted a deep twist between local officials in view of the great green experiment.
In the case of district prosecutors, it is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents accused for marijuana offences and acts on site as a speaker for the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
"They have spent such a large part of their life persecuting people in criminal law that they still cannot accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states that treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national model cases for the legalization of drugs.
While prosecutors and government officials prepare legal sales for an age of time, they also wait nervously for instructions from the Federal Government that continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence.
Forewords of the legalisation movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite several striking arrests by consumers and sellers of medical marijuanas, the Federal Government has largely permitted the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy consultant of the Obama Government, believes that although criminal officials are not likely to enter doors to confiscate smaller amounts of drugs, they are probably going to stumble, tolerating the legal, government-regulated marijuana business under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for the Federal authorities to act.
Before the election day, some local municipal authorities approved moratories for new marijuana businesses, although they could only open in about a year.
Last week Montrose, a city in the West, decided a six-month ban, which is probably adopted next week.
"We do not want to enter a position where we license someone and then face a major problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this change of law.
We are following what the community has decided for and not what the state has decided to do.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mobbed from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students of today are attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had visited that university, which I once thought was the world's largest knowledge stamp, for a modern Greek symposion that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thinking and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my entry at Worscester College at the end of the 1980s - there I had intended to study history - I had again packed my suitcases and thus brought the first scandal of my life.
My father broke up in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I would have gone because I would have had a problem with having communitons in the neighboring room sex.
Author A N Wilson said silly that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged bags.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, run, because I suffered systematically horrored and threatened.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I had come from a private school.
I had been shaken only for one reason - a reason that seemed to be in this alleged cradle of enlightenment for so tighter and crueler: My now dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important consultant Margaret Thatchers and I support the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of students of moderate rights suffers from similar persecution.
The organized and rising hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same equality protection that benefits the gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus of Christ College indicate that, due to their political views, they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted".
They call for a place in the Equality Committee of their college to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Her situation was worsened by a recent documentary on political students at BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which represented Tories as an excentric and neonazis.
This was shown, among other things, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford University, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and produced silver-coloured suit and silver-covered walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say that they are considered "sunding bucks for the introduction of higher study fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, reported in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left trend at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club, without having met us at all."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and historian student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the request for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designated president of the Conservative Student Association of Oxford, says that she has observed a growing rejection from students of moderate rights in JCR members.
"This is a danger to the intellectual discourse and the well-being of members," she says.
In my first weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred on the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
In the previous year, the University had voted to give Margaret Thatcher - a former student - no honorary title because of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would even have scared stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, with which new students meet themselves and the tutors, I received a taste of the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors took part in the mocking of Tory students not only, but even with joy.
Political topics such as the mining strike, the privatization and the rejection of the government of sanctions against the apartheid regime of South Africa found their way into the wooden areas of the Tutorium.
At my first of these events, I should have translated French texts from the 18th century into English. On what was to come, I had not been taken.
"Miss Wyatt," said Tutor Harry Pitt (now died), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stole with it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake pond, and quite harsh.
"Did Thatcher's trailer refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students cheerped.
In my eyes, tears burst up.
"I suggest that they take a few French hours in your leisure time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt touched me.
I returned to my room with hanging head.
That evening I sat at college alone at dinner, when someone tipped me easily to the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Student Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it's how it is.
Everyone who is suspected of being Tory is being impressed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know that your father is near Margaret Thatcher, that's why it'll be worse for you.
Most of the Tory first semesters pretend to be followers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I wasn't in all points with Mrs. Thatcher.
This trick should prove to be unsuccessful.
One study beginner in philosophy, politics and business, who, ironically, had visited Eton College which was considered conservative, said to me, "You are the daughter of a fascist swine".
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How does Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They're beating each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals had to feel before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I only be able to meet the likes after the invasion of darkness?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me stretched out in front of my spiritual eye to a feather of angryness and isolation.
The only tutor to identify himself openly as Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History, who had his seat in my college.
He was hated not only to be a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on matters of foreign policy and written speeches for them.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincially and small-cared and rejected him for his marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to walk between Oxford and my parents' house and found refuge with more open friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the 40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said lazyly.
They would never do such a thing, not in my city of dreaming towers.
Even my Communist friends always showed good manners.
His moist eyes were cheating.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're just necking.
It would break me the heart if you left.
Excited by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance became weaker.
One of my male friends, also Tory pendant, had given up to the pressure and promised his convictions.
During a Tutorium the following week, where another historian had seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly crushed to shame, I admitted that my parents had undergone me with a "hire washing" and called them "old trunk."
The relief only took a short time.
It was my father who struck the last nail in my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press per week.
My door was closed.
I hid myself in my room, and after five minutes, my chests gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
I'm glad you can call me a female snail.
But no 18-year-old should ever suffer from such intimidation and wickedness in a educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Prime Ministers but hiding behind an unworthy reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance of celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which was opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian modem engineer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of the accommodation of an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This has been recognised by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Coutures", a grand retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the Haute Coutures have been compiled, created by his "Maison" in the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but without its distinguished clients could not have been written.
Valentino has always experienced fascination for the sticky and distant world of the noble.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be seen until March 3, there are a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the most read aristocracy, beginning by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, from the Princess Marie Chantal from Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a trophy of his social ascent from the modest modem maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
To be in love with the adel doesn't have to be of disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick on your magnificent carpet, as it does some beautiful fames of pop music," says Baronin Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, closely friends with forgotten beautys such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress of Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the modemacher.
Many years ago, we went to a fashion show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
At every detail of his apartment, decoration, food and music, it was recognized and felt its influence.
"All invited people felt important and loved," remembers the "top model", which started their career at the week of the Haute Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He never comes from fashion because his designs are artwork," she concludes.
Moden view of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessedness, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious and 60-metre-long runway, which proposes a role exchange: the user takes the place of the model and goes along the runway to admire a dreamy "audience", the masterpieces of Valentino, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather belonging to the Emperor Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion puppets, names such as the names of Sibilla de Luxembourgo, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modemacher, 2006
Many of these kids say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can remember perfectly.
It was a trouser, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/Winter collection 1971-72.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the designer.
"I draw him to all others because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the ex-hertogin of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and director of the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 1990s, it finally came.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a festival in my veteran's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with flying rock and a dragged upper part with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a true dream," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, its possession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocratic who lives between París, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the modem-acher "with absolute care" "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the related memories".
The "King" of Mode
The great finale of the exhibition in Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the modem maker called his close women) were necessary to make this eleven-bone silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four-and-a-half-metre-long slip.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the chief authority of the press, this dress was a milestone in the Haute Couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the clients of the top society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now her best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettre, excellent with the honorary legion, cumulates Garavani as many honours as each of his spouses' husbands.
"I always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his well-kept and perfect exterior," admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him the last time a month ago at a Gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of the Count Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was foolish; the time doesn't leave any traces to him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when carrying 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 mining workers who earn their lives by bringing sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For this purpose, he must go down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulphur-containing gas flowing from the earth is fixed in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he transports them into two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the horrible paths of stone.
Although it is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that rises up to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers need more than 40 minutes for the rising of the turtle pace, keeping the balance and taking their steps careful so that they do not slip and crash.
They know that every step can cost their life, as happened by a French tourist who crashed years ago at the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen earn 5 Eurocent for every kilo of sulphur that they degrade.
Upstairs, they run the way between tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometres to the scale, which a mine company has set a little further down on a height of 1850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the occurrences in the volcano since 1960 and (not better said) its workers, to which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 Eurocent) for each kilogram of sulphur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 Eurocent) to the petrochemical industry, because this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used for the manufacture of strikes, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamics and even bleaching of sugar.
"As we usually wear 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3,8 Euros) for every way," explains Anto, who normally makes three routes a day.
For each route, he needs three hours, for which he is fully accomplished, but at the end of the day he then has 138,000 rupees (11,5 Euro) together.
What looks like a miserable wage for such inhuman effort is the threefold of what he would deserve with field work.
"The salary of mine workers here, where the coffee harvest 15,000 rupees (1,2 Euro) is paid on the day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier who previously worked as a Maurer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not as hard as it was, but Anto and his family returned to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason that is as important as the sulphur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Hinduists, and I brought them to Java to convert them to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, husting often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has put his life on Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulphur has already left his first tracks, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, husting frequently, and his eyes are angry because of the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for reaching his dream.
"I will still work here for two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man, but punished by life, could work as a tourist guide, a cellar or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he performs the work of a tragedy.
He shares a dirty wooden cottage with other carriers and stands up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulphur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluely in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small front lamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets on the crater floor with sulphur on their shoulders.
Despite its great profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur degradation to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to the carriers working on their own account and paying after weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 Rupien (2.5 Euro) supplement per photo appliance, which the guards of this natural park together with the entry fee of 15,000 Rupien (1.1 Euro) require from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human wear.
"This work is for the animals and not for the human beings" protests Madrusin, a stupid 42-year-old carrier who has worked at Kawah Ijen for three decades since the school left.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he continues "as long as it goes", because he needs the money for the education of his three children between 10 and 18 years of age.
I'm not going to retire, I'm gonna die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulphur burns the throat and the eyes jucken, when the wind turns suddenly and the mine workers cling into the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains about severe diseases ... of course except the usual breath problems, arthrose, pain in the knees and bubbles on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the basket.
With the basket on its back, Unainik is only capable of carrying 50 kg with its 53 years.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres away.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano was my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth far in which some teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the elder, with his 30 years of age, also works as a sulphur trawler.
The time passes, but the poorness of the generation endures in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as a human burden on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporens push the blame for having no children, career, stress and the cost of real estate and child education.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: We fulfil our citizen's obligation and we create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbonbons, but still - or just that is why - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The sentences are part of a rapper song, the local Proverbs such as "shoes will be a "bao" (laib) in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which has turned the video, sees the hope that the advertising spot can be achieved in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Her creative director Douglas Hamilton says that he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfill their "national duty".
This is something only for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world when we are planting, so we realized that it was an issue we had to care for.
We knew that the government had tried a lot, such as the marketing of perfume with pheromones or the organization of speed dating channels (fast flirts).
Possibly that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not lead forcefully to success.
So we thought, why not make something as creative as possible to deal with this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Anyone who does not take this issue easily is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 for political measures to encourage citizens to receive more children.
A package of government grants up to $15,000 dollars per child for couples and parents, extends maternity leave and distributes tax advantages.
But everything had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich high-technological city in the southeast of Asia, which is also known for the conservatism of its governments and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - which is also known as a replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporens get any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, says that this is due to "better education" and "great career opportunities".
"This has enabled people to marry and form a family to have far more options in terms of life's goals and to set priorities," she explains.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the higher number of single persons and to the delays in marriage and births, whose result is the reduction of birth rates in Singapore.
At the same time, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population led to retirement among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where the hardly cast Xenophobia blooms against many new immigrants, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping the wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also considered to be one of the reasons why the Government Party in Singapore last year achieved its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenue, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to achieve that not so many small apartments are built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and may be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person and that they deter the building firms from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Real Estate Company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger units of living.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out faster by days and even weeks than the larger units of living.
This leads to them being much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations that were previously hindered if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city.
Even if these new rules could lead to an increase in the national birth rate, talks with the Singaporens working in the financial quarter should be noted that they will have no significant effect.
"The people are very stressed, the apartments and also the education are expensive, so it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man about twenty years old.
Men and women lead to their career, stress and the cost of property and education as a reason for not having children.
That is why the Singaporens have the last word when it comes to getting children - there the government can do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of private or "their area of private life, where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to its everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he announces on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are often on the network.
In four of the cases, they linked the term with "something very own" at personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't reveal in a post," says the 10-year-old Jorge in trying to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I pick up beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I'm also spending my time with friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who makes the stupid head," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of naked, of crime, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine successors in Twitter.
Most are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged in to Twitter to express me and write interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I'm just loading them up," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
He asked that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone felt him a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teen has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something mean, for example, music," he says.
When the boy was told, no one made his statements or asked him for his address or phone number.
"When someone pressures me or demands me, I just remove him from my user account" he admits.
José reported on Ask after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The boy is not unknown experiences that are known as cyberbullying today.
The friend was extorted in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never learned who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He just made it private."
Afterwards, he explains a number of steps to securely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would do that if he was inconsistent with me or I wanted to wipe him out one thing.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient the children and young people, it must be understood that it is the purpose of social networks to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information; with the publication of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, the holder of a master's title in pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these terms for the explanation of the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants they should teach where we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex subject, "because we demand from them that they have a defined criterion about what can be disseminated, published or said, and that in an age where maturity is not sufficient for it."
"They should also be selective if it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach the children and young people what privacy is to ask them questions that give them thought.
"To say they shouldn't do it, doesn't work," he says.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger. Why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like to publish a photo of you, like that you have published by a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you labeled photos of celebrations?
And another question, must everyone know what you're doing at any moment?
Another point is to give them to understand that they need to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"Anyone outside the Internet is dealing with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, commented that it is indispensable for parents to carefully read the guidelines of social networks.
When they understand all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening one user account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what one can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children need to be reminded of the lesson "You shouldn't talk to strangers."
Conclusion of the summit of the Unasur without publication of the declaration of Lima
The 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without publishing the declaration of Lima, which was previously announced and should be signed theoretically by the seven governments present.
Efe repeatedly tried to obtain access to the signed document at the VI. Ordinary meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially informed that they would pass it after the Klausur, however, explained that it would be published at a certain time on the website of the Peruvian government.
In the case of questions about the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, by brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at any time.
During the day in the press room, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was transferred with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists were received by the press speakers of some of the governments of the Unasur present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press speaker.
The only document that was distributed during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media that demanded more information.
Afterwards, the Peru Presidential Office sent the media an e-mail with the final statement of the summit, but it was the Humala statement and not the official document on the conclusion of the summit.
In October last, Peru was host of the IIIth Summit of South America - Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite the strong call from the press, the so-called declaration of Lima, which was previously announced, was just as little published.
On the official ASPA website, you can convince yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were available for journalists, but they restricted access to information to a high degree.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of the Hague, which imposes a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the IGH, which begins in The Hague on Monday, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago, to listen to the Pledoyers of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment on the differences we presently make to this international court," Humala said together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and remains a country that adheres to international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Piñera added, greeting Humala with a hand pressure from the flags of both countries.
The two presidents confirmed that they would submit to the IGH after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake, had appealed against the Bogotá Agreement, which agreed to submit to the judgments of this International Court.
The presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, who has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the postponement of his President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the discussions in the morning and closed the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of State reads the final document, in which it informed that 16 decisions were taken and that the action lines for 31 projects between the South American countries were set over a total investment amount of $17 billion.
On the decisions taken, he said that the countries of the Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, extending the decisions on residence rights."
He noted that measures would be promoted to "improve cooperation in the fight against uncertainty in cities and against the organised cross-border crimes, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all regions of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant trains, but should be used to expand our production performance and to show our people a better future," Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects to improve spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas...and thus unite our countries and make new economic forms," said the Peruan President in a read-out statement.
Among these projects were five Peruvians, which lay on the cross-axis of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which should make a better connection with Ecuador, although it did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American nations", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to continue to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourhood relations was another aspect that was emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before joining the regional meeting, that on Saturday in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his counterpart of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict respectfully after a judgment of the IGH raised by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega on the morning (saturday)," said Santos.
"We will check all these ways - they are not exclusive, and also the agreement with Nicaragua makes discussions with Nicaragua necessary," he underlined.
"I hope to tell the President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the office of the new president of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the Ministers of Defence of the Block also met in advance to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of the UNASUR, even though the latter is currently excluded.
Peru has the Presidency at the time of the regional block.
"South America needs to learn to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, where "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, explained to the Peru state television that the Europeans were "enforced in World War II and in other conflicts" and "today are practically a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that promotes the member states of the Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andes community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganization of the organization of American States (OEA), with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglican States and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to something, and in return to that we always sign everything to the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has its headquarters in Washington and is financed by the United States," he explained as an indication of the political asylum that Ecuador has granted to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he had not betrayed his principles, but followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there had been "founded assumptions that Assange would be delivered to a third country and not comply with his procedure."
He also criticized the Swedish judicial who had requested him to undergo an interrogation in his territory for a alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish jurisdiction allowed this by means of a video conference that could have been carried out via the message of Ecuador in London."
Correa explained that the risk would be that the health and mental condition of assanges would be affected.
"Since he is in our message, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a light problem with the lungs, but no serious thing," said the head of Ecuador.
However, there is the risk that he naked physical and psychological damage because he was caught in a narrow room and could not carry out physical exercises outside.
"That would affect the health of every person," he added.
Correa indicated that the solution for the asylum, the Assange was granted in the Embassy of Ecuador in London since June, was the grant of a free letter to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the judicial authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been discussions with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use this word for this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European institutions," he said.
And "when Britain gives this free letter tomorrow, I think this is done."
And if Sweden asked Mr Assange on the Embassy of Ecuador in London or about Skype how it allowed Swedish jurisdiction and in other cases, the problem was done.
Correa took advantage of the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and said that what he does not tolerate "is the meanness, the evil intention and the lies that defy the free expression of opinion."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and extortion," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated him that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "and neither by the bankers or hegemonic and spear-bourgeois countries," and presumed that he would " deepen the revolution in order to continue the way in that right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the unasury at least to its next elections, arguing that the organism must "remain hard and not allow any opportunism or any legally enclothed state strife to take place", because it "the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay was destroyed."
The President of Ecuador also holds the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which preceded the Maritime State Highness of Nicaragua to negotiate the maritime borders between both countries with Nicaragua, for "absolutely justified."
This judgment is not currently being implemented.
This is a problem between a Southern and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be treated extensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes on the sea borders between Peru and Chile before the same Court of Justice and said that "for Latin America it is right to call on international authorities if both countries are obliged to accept the judgment even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he would be a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to reach his third mandate in a row, he said that he saw this option "with much optimism and joy, although it sometimes is very difficult."
Correa assured that if he abandoned the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but in as unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to follow this responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as President, then I will withdraw from public life.
This is also true if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned, routine treatment and that would expect him to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a relapse in the health condition of President Chávez," he commented.
At the 6th Summit of the Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, the ecuadorian Head of State was today attended with the call for higher regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of an AIDS death is a late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the investigation result: HIV-positive.
"It was like a bomb slipped in," he says about the moment when he received the diagnosis that the doctor attempted to "swaken out without any perceived success."
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; and this with such use that he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immune deficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided adopting "because it led to a sack street."
At that time AIDS was synonym for death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people are still entering the clinic, who know nothing about their disease and in which the virus has already damaged and exhausted its immune system, and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first cases reported, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who takes the treatment in time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was supported by a renowned scientific publication in April this year.
The expert on infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that, although AIDS was not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depended on the degree of impairment of the immune system of persons at the beginning of treatment, and that those greater opportunities that are not dry dependent: up to 30 years with a number of 200 CD4 and 50 years with a number of 500 CD4.
Simply said, the above statements mean that whoever receives the diagnosis HIV-positive at the age of 25 can in this sense "become troublelessly 75 years old as long as he is under control," said this specialist.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be recalled that the life expectancy of Mexicans today averages 76 years.
Even if mortality has significantly decreased in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (OnUSIDA Annual Report), it is still right that 60 percent of patients recorded in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May this year, there are 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines since 2005.
So why do people still die?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least over the past 12 years, we have not had any health problems with the medicines. The problem is that people are in a far advanced state because they do not know their condition of infection, i.e. in very late phases of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have a accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, more early diagnostics are required, so that all people in which this is necessary must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is agreed by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (state aid prevention committee in Jalisco) and also by the patients like Fabrizio who had his test carried out in a private laboratory, and for the only reason because it had made a friend of him who was already in the AIDS phase despite his young age and even had the Kaposi-sarkom (a cancer-like tumor) which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different if you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather put three times," I'd say in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, drive sports and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, as anybody else.
"I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person," Fabrizio counts up, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to stimulate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of the world's AIDS day.
They should do the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsible like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the charging table
Big holes exist between health programmes and the simple citizen, Ricardo Salazar, journalist from Guadalajara, who has accepted the matter of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
At the given locations "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; before they were released individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
Adolescents are the risk persons for new infections.
"Why do you need this?" is a widespread spot question by social workers, orientation staff in schools, pharmacy workers and health careers who do not want to stop young people, assured the correspondent.
He proposed that this inefficient distribution be reoriented; the condoms should be not only behind the store table, but also in public toilets of facilities often visited by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as governor Emilio González replied to the question of whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already exercising sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is nationally located at the fourth place of new and cumulated AIDS cases, and at the 13th place in relation to HIV.
92% of infections occur via sex, 6% over blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the Appeal Court of the United States has confirmed a judgment which does not recognise the restructure of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which has reached a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an unhealthy precedent is created for each national company with branches in the neighbouring country with payment problems.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment received on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas court for the northern district in Texas leads to a helpless exposure to the Mexican companies to the confiscation of their property beyond the river Bravo.
However, the decision opens door and gate to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge points out that creditors must be subject to the United States bankruptcy law, the Appeal Tribunal of the Fifth Circuit, headquartered in New Orleans, first states that the main proceedings are the trade bankruptcy treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation is not known in the case of incapacity payment procedures for companies with cross-country profiles.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations model law was established for the unification of international trade law, with the American Law Institute being set up as a slighter.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the votes of the companies following recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass that the branches of Vitro with their parent company had not been reached the necessary majority for the restructuring of liabilities.
However, this possibility is recognised by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme was approved.
There are a half dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities were confirmed by the Instituteo Federal de Concursos Merantiles (Bundesinstitut für Handelskonkurse).
It is also correct that, after deduction of the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro at the courts of the United States, i.e. the donor funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, had not reached a majority.
The vote would have expired 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the appeal court.
On the other hand, Vitro is responsible for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which caused blows to the country.
For this reason, the González Sada family objects to the same appeal court so that the vote will take place in the plenary session, i.e. from all judges, because only three voted.
If this is not accepted, the Cerciorare objection which calls for the review of the procedure by a higher authority, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing in this case is that the court left a document dismissed by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Tribunal), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the law on trade bankruptcies, and which points out that it strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Conkurs Act.
It is also noted that the country has subjected to the principles of the United Nations Commission for international trade, i.e. the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border incapacity guaranteeing the equity of debtors and creditors.
Two-banded carambole: a blow for Vitro and for the country.
General balance sheet
After the advertisements of the Mexican air traffic trade unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of a fraudulent administration, did not come forward for several months, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Pilot Association Association) finally made progress.
The request led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now submitted a criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of the disability of justice.
Afterwards, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the Republic's main administration of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to remove 198 million Pesos from the F/589 Trust Account of Bank IXE to the name Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used to acquire shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum at the University of Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmental protectors, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of the civil society decided to create a wide front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we speak of a huge sales and sales centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of the Processing Industry) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental establishment, which partly destroyed areas and represents the mother of all the threats of the industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government of a Senate's request to explain under which conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassadors in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, has already been archived according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place, although the Senate had overlooked the possibility because he viewed them as infringements of the freedom of expression in the social networks.
Homex long-term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without any impairment of short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex brings stock exchange certificates to the market over 500 million pesos.
Emission is the first of four equal emissions that promise interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Designed from NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies was founded under the name Competival, whose goal is the service market of the software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The world bummler of Basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basket sport for more than 60 years and has traveled the whole world.
Few in Puerto Rico have a large spiritual collection of the history of the country's basketball, such as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being bound to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether it was a player of lower classes, players of the first national League, representatives and leaders in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"I have set up many hats for my life in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, head of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s," Reyes recalled his visit to Primera Hora in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Bastetball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and witness them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those who remember his time at the Vaqueros from the mid-50s as players until 1982, where he celebrated his 15-year anniversary as co-operative leader or director of the club.
"They were my best years I enjoyed most because I had been part of eight championships of Vaqueros since 1967, whether it was a managing director, co-conductor or trainer.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships after each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I adopted with a championship 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager," Reyes says.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said: "I have a very powerful and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Afterwards, Bartow recommended the free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a citizen and one of our best advertisers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had allowed a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would take care of another one.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was awarded to him, but it was already out of a distance because he was already in 1988 at the top of the association.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won the U.S. for the first time at the Vorolympic tournament in Mexico.
After that, the World Championship came in 1990, where we occupied the fourth place, which actually should have been bronze, if not this Canadian arbitrator, who let us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of World Championship 1990 the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as those who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite is, however, the team of the 1991 pan-American games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the U.S. team, as at the time when they won us at the World Championship Bronze.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz) were there again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who couldn't be involved in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which made us great joy was those of the pre-olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the locked players because of the events on the Pan American games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every prognosis.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
That was undoubtedly Piculín Ortiz.
His figures at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín.
And this, without taking into account his career in the different bodies in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What else will you do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and meet in national playoffs on teams from other corners of the island.
Today the children make unnecessary many travels and games.
At least I see the result of the required training and courses for trainers, table officers and arbitrators.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and then go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the society of my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and was famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a unscrupulous, vulnerable and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon because of cancer complications according to a press release from the family to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved birth town of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role that he liked most," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the festivals of the Harvest Thanksgiving Festival.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and follow-up series, was at Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, said her journalist Jeffrey Lane.
He made joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived in full trains," said Gray in a message.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992 with liver cirrhosis, and he admitted that he had drank a lot over years.
In 1995 a malicious tumor was detected in his liver, and he was subject to transplantation.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known as a nice type in television in the years 1965-1970 with the Sitcom "Bezaubernde Jeannie" of the NBC Television Centre.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he meets an attractive "Djinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He was also performer of two comedies, which were broadcast only a short time, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Herre We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His cinema works included well rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly awesome J.R. who made Hagman a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS television chain over the Ewing-Clan and other figures in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The proclamation "Who shot on J.R.?" was supposed to create the expectation for an episode full of emotions, where the figure of Hagmann was almost killed, led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were betted in competition houses.
The series thus reached a spectator record at that time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million spectators who transformed "Dallas" into the second most viewed entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was Kristin who had shot the sister of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had weakened her and threatened to present her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. But others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and unfaithful husband who strived to allow his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to stand on the gravestone of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It should be called "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-actor of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "great personality on and outside the screen".
He is unforgettable and unrecoverable for millions of worshippers in the world and remains in our hearts to us who have had the happiness of knowing and loving him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success in the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just rotated, the transmitter informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin who played classical works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a youth when she got Larry during her marriage with lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatre beans in New York at the beginning of the 50s, then he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he named his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything of which I believed it could harm someone or affect him in any way," said the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplantation, he used liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are ahead and afterwards," he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as "no fear, it's a little uncomfortable for the first time, but it's gonna go well."
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of course studying the "End of the World"
Each week, students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
Each semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long reverse count" of the Maya calendar on December 21, which many people believed was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what should expect him in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict with Israel's participation, the place from which Christian theoreticians believe that the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't notice that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that has ever existed," said Charmé this week to the students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If anyone analyzes what happened today in the world as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds that the bad is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor who offers this semester, which should actually be the last in history, courses about the "end of the world".
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "media, culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs and global warming.
"We analyse why these ideas are spreading in time," he said, as well as the way in which hypothetic scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
If nuclear material comes into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how to compare themselves with real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probably, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor for Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, a senior professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course with the simple name "The End of the World".
"We don't take up 2012 so that we always keep the option to retain the course, in case the world is not undergoing," said Restall.
Despite the "previous downturn", students must study, create projects and participate in audits.
In Penn State, the audit will be carried out on the evening of the apocalypse, so the students have no other chance than to "work on until night where the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places," said Restall about his high average course for students who filled with 35 students.
For weeks before semester we received e-mails from students who asked if still places were free.
The students assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The Apocalyptic Sects or Religiousment is actually only a question of comfort or lack of it.
The 25-year-old Student Will Wekesa for Psychology and Healthcare explains to have seen all apocalyptic films.
"Never heard of a lesson where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students interviewed - and less a professor - explained to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the prophecy of Mayas, and in a certain way we discredit them," said Julie Zeglen, student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never foretold the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
He notes, however, that in the Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that leads back several centuries when people responded to changes in their surroundings with the prediction of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"On the other side, people don't think so," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the University of La Salle, who is teaching the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the "end of the world".
"The Philippines do not participate at the end of the world," he wrote as analyst on an exception to a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
The rest pointed out that over the years many days were spoken by the last court and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "the people immediately remember a new date" or philosophed that the 21st December was the beginning of a seven-year period to which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date easily.
Several said that they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"I may call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
