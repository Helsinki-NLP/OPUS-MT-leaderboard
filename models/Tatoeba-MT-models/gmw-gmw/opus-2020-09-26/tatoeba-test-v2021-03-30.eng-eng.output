She's not a good cook.
Tom said he's not in a hurry.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who does that.
I didn't know you weren't Canadians.
Come to watch us play music sometime.
Tom said he understands why Mary doesn't want to do that.
Tom said Mary was too busy to help you do that today.
Tom told me he'd complain about that.
Tom's a member of my housing co-op.
Tom drove down the street that Mary lives on, hoping to see her.
I'm sure it wasn't hard to do that.
You know as well as I do that there's no chance that Tom will do that.
Tom wasn't sure if he should kiss Mary or not, so he didn't.
I know that Tom might need to do that by himself.
Tom doesn't seem to do what he's supposed to do.
It would have been tiring to do that.
Tom must have told us the truth.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
We'll have to do something.
When do you plan to do that?
Tom said he didn't believe Mary really planned to do that this week.
Tom knew he would be punished.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone doing that before.
That's not difficult.
I'm afraid we don't have any left.
Tom told me I should learn how to play the drums.
We haven't succeeded yet.
I've never been to Paris.

Tom thought Mary was alone.
I know Tom's hiding something from me.
Did you know that Tom didn't start playing the guitar until he was thirty years old?
I wonder if Tom knows Mary wants to do that.
I'm sure Tom will be back.
I don't think Tom knows where Mary went on October 20th.
I know Tom knows he doesn't have to do that.
Why is everyone staring at us?
I know Tom didn't know who had done that to Mary.
I reason that Tom did that was because everyone else in his family did.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Tom told me that he thought Mary didn't know how to play the oboe.
I would like to use this opportunity to thank you.
I would have left early if I could have.
I know I have to do that before Tom gets here.
I don't think you'd enjoy doing that.
Tom hasn't talked to Mary about that yet.
I don't think Tom's handsome.
Tom was the only one who was sleeping.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
I should never have let you go home alone last night.
I think I'm going to have the chance to do that the day after tomorrow.

Tom said I don't have to do that this afternoon.
Tom said it was a good time to leave.
I know Tom's scared.
You can't appreciate the poem until you read it many times.
Deliberately, I did that.
Tom should never have left early.
She's already married.
This is blasphemy!
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't awake.
Tom said he's glad he was able to do that.
You can't buy one of those for less than thirty dollars.

I don't think I'll be as early tomorrow as I was today.
It's not likely that Tom will ever admit that he's wrong.
How many kilometers is it from here to the railway station?
I don't think that story is true.
He often adopts the behaviors and speech patterns that characterize the benefited.
Tom said you were his friend.
I'm thinking of having dinner at six.
Tom told Mary he would do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's through.
Tom said Mary's dog bite him.
Tom said he was doing that.
Tom said he appeals to his suspension.
He's deeply attached to her.
I thought you'd show me how to do that.
I'm telling you we have to assume that Tom's dead.
Mary's got a hairdresser's appointment.
Tom said Mary thought she might be allowed to do that today.
If you don't want to come, you don't have to.
It smells like somebody's been smoking a cigar here.
We're just in time for the last train.
I think that question is not appropriate.
Didn't you live in Australia when you were a kid?
I don't think anyone noticed what we were doing.
What are we going to do?
I could have cried.
There's no free lunch.
I thought you said we weren't going to Boston with Tom.
Tom's quitting smoking.

Did you give the key to Tom?

Tom told me he thought Mary was satisfied.
Tom said he was going to help us do that.
Tom's house is very close to my house.
The host cut the turkey for the guests.

I think Tom will be able to understand that.
I haven't decided yet.

It won't be so hard to do that.
Don't let Tom do that by himself.
I was so excited!
Tom is a party animal.
I thought it might be fun, so I went to Tom's party.
Tom will unlikely need to do that today.
I hope I don't need to do that.

No one's better on this than me.

Get your paws off of me.
I'm afraid I have to refuse.

I knew Tom would be happy if you did that.
I wonder if we'll really do that today.
Tom's sleeping.
You're a good boy.
I should just have walked in.
I don't think you've been listening to me.
We're brother and sister.
I don't think Tom's finished doing that.
I don't think we've done anything illegal.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try it before.
Didn't you have a television?
Don't give up!
I'm not playing the mandolin as well as you.

I don't know what this means.
I think it's more important to discuss possible solutions.

I just want you to consider the possibility that you're wrong.
I'm sure I didn't say that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I'm as happy as can be.
If they knew what was about to happen, they would have changed their plans.

Were you afraid the first time you were on a plane?
I'm sorry I didn't keep my promise.

I'm disappointed in my son.
I don't think I did very well.
Do you think there's a chance you'll do that tomorrow?
You know I don't have a car.
There's a large supermarket.
I suspect Tom was discouraged.
I'm sure Tom won't force anyone to do that.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be allowed to do that.
I would have done the same thing Tom did.
Are you sure that nobody can see us?
There's no solution to this problem.
I heard Tom was in trouble.
I wonder if Tom will be busy tomorrow.
I suspected Tom couldn't have enough money to buy everything he wanted.
Has he been in touch with you?
Tom and Mary said they'd be doing that soon.
Tom bought a lot of souvenirs.
Today's the twentieth of October.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go on.
I hope Tom saw what Mary did.
I don't think Tom knows Mary isn't Canadian.
Africa is not a country.
Tom wasn't the one who told me he didn't have to do that.
Tom knows I didn't agree to do that.
I don't have kids.
I know that Tom forgot to do that.
I know you want to be happy.
I don't think that book is so interesting.
I was told that that's not a good idea.
I don't think Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think our team is going to keep getting better.
I wish someone would help me with that.
Tom definitely knows that he shouldn't do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary and I can take care of ourselves.
I'm not sure Tom will be there.
It's a big responsibility.
I think you should turn in.
I wonder if Tom enjoys doing that.
Tom said he thought Mary was too old to do that.
I should have known that I couldn't trust Tom.
I didn't know you and Tom worked together.
Nobody will know that I'm here.
I'm glad I left Australia.
Tom said he thought I needed to get more exercise.
Tom told me he was trying to do that.
Tom and Mary know they shouldn't do that.
Tom said Mary thought he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
I knew Tom was the one who was supposed to tell Mary she shouldn't do that.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary was sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they weren't coming back.
Tom doesn't know Mary's in love with someone else.
I don't think Tom's concerned.
I wish I had the chance to learn French in high school.
It was clear that Tom was supposed to help us do that.
I knew Tom was going to be the one to do that.
I thought Tom was still in jail.
Tom said that Mary thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom said he probably wouldn't win.
It's possible Tom may not know that I'm here.
Do you think I'm weird?
Tom thinks he knows it all.
Tom said it's not going to end well.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't do that today.
I thought we had something to give to Tom.
The students did the work themselves.
Tom and Mary said they didn't mind doing that.
You'll stay here until you're called.
My daughter's being trained toilet.
Tom said he didn't think Mary could have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they were feeling fine.
They said they're not ready to go.
Something's happened to him.
Nobody suspected anything like this.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to be married to each other.
Tom and Mary told me they've never met you.
I think Tom is a pretty good painter.
I know Tom is a picky eater and seldom tries anything new.
Tom says he didn't do anything illegal.
I suspect Tom knows Mary doesn't live in Boston anymore.
I know Tom doesn't love me.
I know that Tom knows I know how to do that.
Look at this high mountain.
She's still chatting away.
You're a nerd.
Everyone was late except me.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Tom will probably get mad if you do that.
I assumed Tom would agree to do that.
I'm a liberarian.
May I ask Tom to help me?
I wonder if Tom could help us.
I don't think I've ever met anyone like you.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that today.
I don't think Tom will have to do that alone.
She wants to know who sent the flowers.
My hearing isn't as good as it used to be.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia.
Tom admitted that he was rude.
You'll have a hard time.
I should have let Tom talk to you first.
Tom is now either in Australia or in New Zealand.
I didn't think we should talk about that.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would let me do that.
Didn't you know you weren't supposed to be there?
I know Tom is a little older than Mary is.
Tom didn't know someone had been hired to kill him.
Tom told me he can't eat peanuts.
I don't think Tom would enjoy doing that.
Tom said he thought I might not have to do that.
Shut up and listen to me.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
Tom said he suspected Mary was very eager to do that.
Am I the only one who's confused?
I know Tom is a bully.
He's a smart boy.
How's your dad?
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't sleeping.
Tom told me he thought Mary was home.
I hope Tom doesn't become jealous.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't what Tom meant.
It won't be hard for us to do that.
Tom said Mary didn't look tired of him.
I doubt that Tom would ever be allowed to do that.
Tom and Mary say they don't plan to go on anymore.
I think Tom has a plan.
It's not what it seems.
They said they felt comfortable.
Tom said he had never planned to live in Australia for so long.
Tom told me he didn't really want to go to Boston.
Tom has a lot more books than you do.
I know Tom's about the same height as you are.
There's no excuse for his delay.
Tom must've been the one who put the drugs in my bag.
Tom said he's glad Mary wasn't hurt.
Tom asked Mary if she would read the book that he would borrow her.
I woke up at seven o'clock.
I could have done that, but I didn't.
Tom and Mary haven't told anyone they're getting married yet.
They said they planned to go Monday.
It's not going to be easy to find someone to rent this house.
Don't talk so fast, please.
They told me they had bacon and eggs for breakfast.
Tom didn't tell anyone they had to do that.
I think Tom paid too much for that old saxophone.
Tom said he was all worn out.
Tom told me he thought Mary was busy.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary should do that.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was finished.
I thought you had to work.
Tom said he didn't have everything he needed.
You should have stayed where you were.
I'll miss you.
You never told me you didn't like Australia.
Tom and Mary said they're trying to lose weight.
Tom told me he thought Mary was optimistic.
Tom says he can wait, but Mary can't.
Tom could have kicked himself.
I don't think Tom would help me with my homework.
Tom must be right.
You knew I was the only one who could do that, didn't you?
Tom said he didn't think he could do that without our help.
Tom thinks Mary is not awake.
Did anyone else hug Tom?
Tom told me he liked my idea.
I know you're just doing that to annoy me.
That's a mistake.
One way is not better than the other.
What's wrong with me?
Is anyone afraid?
Tom thinks he can do anything he sets his mind to.
We married seven years ago.
I could have done that better than Tom did.
I don't think we're ready to do that yet.
I thought we were friends.
Please, don't be mad with me!
I don't think Tom could have done that better.
I know Tom didn't do that right.
She's in a bad mood.
I didn't think Tom would cry.
Tom thinks Mary's better at French than she really is.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think Tom would have done that?
That's his house.
I'm at home.
You don't need to pay for your lunch.
Maybe I should've tried harder.
I thought Tom was going to do that today.
They promised they'd check it out.
I'm sure Tom would have agreed.
Tom and Mary said they don't like to do that.
Tom said he knew he might have to do that by himself.
I know I'm in trouble now.
It's not the final goal, but the process of getting there matters.
Tom must have put up a fight.
Tom says he wants to do the same thing I did in Australia.
I'm worried because I think there's a chance that Tom might be hurt.
Tom said he was glad you did that.
I always knew Tom was a troublemaker.
Well I never!
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to win.
I'm a student, but he's not.
Tom said he thought he knew what Mary was planning to do.
I wonder if Tom is really homesick.
Tom and Mary said they can't sing very well.
Tom said he thought Mary was good at French.
Tom says he'll always love Mary.
I wish I could speak French as fluently as you do.
I wish I was someone else.
I thought Tom had already done his homework.
Tom's not busy.
I just wanted you to know I support you.
Tom said he knew the area well.
We're all in serious danger.
Why would anyone care what Tom thinks?
I just cooked an egg for myself.
Have you got a pen with you?
I don't think Tom will be in Australia next summer.
Tom and Mary will probably not be able to buy everything they need for $300.
They said they like this time of year.
Tom wants Mary to know that she can trust him.
They say they rejected that deal.
I know Tom didn't know you couldn't do that.
I think I'll stay in Australia for a few more weeks.
With his last breath, he told him he was adopted.
I know Tom is a really close friend of Mary's.
I know Tom didn't know who was supposed to do that.
Tom thinks we can take care of ourselves.
Why didn't you tell me that Tom wouldn't do that?
I know that Tom would unlikely agree to do that.
Tom shut down his computer.
I don't think Tom knows what time it is.
It's obvious Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom and Mary say they don't believe John really plans to do that.
Tom could've asked me first.
You're not actually suggesting I'm going out with another girl, are you?
I didn't do that as soon as I should have.
I don't think Tom's bossy.
Did you know Tom had relatives in Australia?
I don't think Tom will give you the keys.
I wonder if Tom has ever asked Mary why she didn't.
I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't helped me.
Tom said he wanted to change his plans.
How do you tell someone that?
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't hungry.
I thought Tom already knew that.
Tom told me he thought Mary had done that.
Tom and Mary swore they would never hit me again.
Tom said he should have stayed in Australia longer.
Tom said he knew they might not allow him to do that at school.
I know I can do this.
I don't think I should have left before Tom.
Tom said he wouldn't help Mary anymore.
That guy there reminds me of someone I used to know.
Tell them I'll come.
His face turned white.
I thought I heard something.
I've already told Tom I need to do that.
I'm planning to stay home all day Monday.
I'd rather do this alone.
Tom is the only person who could have stolen Mary's necklace.
I don't think we're ready.
No one contradicted Tom.
Are you sure you want to go to Australia with Tom?
Do you really think Tom is amused by what's going on?
We haven't started fighting yet.
Who's knocking on the door?
I think Tom is the only one who doesn't know how to do that.
They said they're supportive.
I thought that would be a great idea.
What you said shocked everyone.
Tom and Mary told me they were ambidextrous.
Tom said he thought that what Mary did was a mistake.
I hope no one's coming.
I thought everyone could do that.
I think we'll be back soon.
Tom said he thought Mary was in her bedroom studying.
Tom and Mary promised they wouldn't tell anyone.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Tom told me it didn't matter.
I know that Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I'm twelve.
I would have forgotten about that.
Tom told everyone he was doing that.
They figured there was no hope.
Tom said Mary didn't want to do that again.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were pleased.
I thought you said you were glad you didn't do that.
Tom can speak French a little.
I know Tom is a lot more than I am.
I thought that's what you wanted.
I can't guarantee that that's going to happen.
I knew Tom wasn't very busy.
I don't think I've ever seen Tom with Mary.
I know Tom's faster doing that than Mary.
Tom said that he thought Mary might not be required to do that again.
You're not worried about the test, are you?
Tom said he was willing to help me do that.
I told you I don't know if Tom will tell the truth or not.
Everyone's having a good time.
Tom said he didn't do what Mary said he did.
Both Tom and Mary wanted to do that.
You shouldn't use someone else's toothbrush.
Tom thinks he loves Mary more than John loves Alice.
I wonder if Tom will be able to do that.
Tom thought it was difficult.
We have walked around the lake.
I don't think it's going to be hard to convince Tom.
They said they didn't work on Mondays.
I don't think Tom is as rich as most people think he is.
You won't do such a thing.
You're so hot!
Tom would have been thirty years old today if he hadn't passed last year.
They said they were very mad.
I know Tom knows I want to do that.
I wonder if Tom's safe.
I know Tom didn't know he shouldn't do that here.
Does Tom know you want to buy a new computer?
I haven't done that yet.
Tom said he felt like doing that.
I don't understand how this could have happened.
You're as high as my sister.
Tom has read a lot of books about that.
I think Tom's already done enough.
Do you know anyone in Boston?
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew what Mary wanted to do.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I thought you would be happy to see me.
Tom admitted that he was the one who stole Mary's money.
Tom and Mary were told they had to do that.
We better tell the others.
Why's everyone talking about Tom?
Federer held at love at 2-2.
Tom and Mary will do whatever you ask them to.
I know that Tom could save himself a lot of time by just doing that himself.
Tom said he was hoping that he and Mary could sing together.
I said nothing, and that made him mad.
When will he be finished?
You're a very nonsense boy.
Tom plans to do that in the near future.
We're late.
You're not the only one who knows what's going on, are you?
A plate of pilaf with some kebabs is heaven on earth.
Tom and Mary told Tom that they were planning to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary could do that or not.
Who sends letters by mail? These days we have email.
If something sounds too good to be true, then it is probably.
Tom said he hopes you won't want to do that.
Tom said he wished he hadn't been there.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I know you're not happy.
Tom and Mary said they're not in a hurry.
We might need to be in Australia for several weeks.
I hadn't planned to do that, but I can if you really want me to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do that.
Tom said he expected Mary to participate.
I'm swimming every day.
Who's the lucky guy?
They pretended they didn't know me.
I know that Tom is a bit shorter than Mary is.
Tom will do that if no one stops him.
I'm sure Tom will refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
You know Tom and I are not going to do that, are you?
Tom and Mary told me that they finished doing that by 2:30.
I'm sure we should've turned left there.
Everyone knows Tom speaks good Galician.
I thought you might not be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he had forgotten something.
She doesn't like snakes and mathematics.
I knew Tom didn't want to do that, but he did it anyway.
Tom's really got a lot on his plate at the moment.
I knew Tom knew who needed to do that.
I don't think you should drive.
Let's hope that changes today.
It's not fair at all.
That's not exactly what I said.
They put their books down.
I know Tom is a better driver than I am.
I thought you loved Tom.
That's not feasible with current technology.
They said that they are trying to be optimistic.
Tom said everyone in his office speaks French.
I wonder if Tom has already told Mary not to do that.
I don't think Tom needs to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're sick.
Tom said he isn't allowed to do that.
I suppose you're going somewhere with this.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
You have a sense of humour.
Tom said he thought he should learn how to do that.
It's not something I want to discuss.
I think Tom will refuse to do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed my help.
I think she's over 40 years old.
Can you cook an omelette?
Tom said he knew I was coming.
No one asked you to come here.
I wonder if Tom really kissed Mary last night.
We hope you'll be in Boston next spring.
You know I won't say anything.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I can't walk anymore.
I wonder if we could do anything to help.
Tom said he would be willing to help us do that.
I don't think Tom is capable of that.
Tom didn't know he had to do that by himself.
Tom's dating a girl who's three years younger than he is.
I think Tom wouldn't refuse to do that.
Tom said he wasn't interested in sports.
Tom said he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I know Tom would be interested in doing that.
I think Tom will like this wine.
I think we spoke on the phone.
I know Tom doesn't know why Mary should do that.
There's a certain amount of truth in what he's saying.
Tom said he wanted to write a book.
I don't think Tom is a slob.
He's not a virtuoso.
I suspect Tom lied to me.
Tom will eventually need to do that.
Tom told me he'd call at 2:30.
Tom hasn't told Mary what he has to do yet.
I know Tom's a good diver.
It's not easy for me to trust anyone.
I knew I should have stayed home.
I don't think this is enough food to feed all of us.
He is not the sharpest knife in the drawer.
Tom said he's planning to be a doctor.
I'm disappointed that my friends aren't here.
A wolf cannot be tamed.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I don't think that's right.
I'm not gonna do anything about it.
Tom says he hasn't done anything wrong.
Tom didn't know what he should have done.
Tom said I should study harder.
They say they'll hurt me.
I know Tom might be tempted to do that.
I'm not sure I can win this.
I'm afraid you won't be paid.
Are you worried that that might happen?
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary did that.
Don't forget to take your umbrella when you leave here.
I'll see that done.
I wear a suit but don't wear a bond.
I'm as tired as you.
Tom thought he might come down with a cold.
I think Tom hates waiting for me.
I should have apologized right away.
You're lucky you didn't get hurt.
Where do Tom and Mary plan to live?
This tree is more than a century old.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
I don't think that was the right thing to do.
Are you sure Tom will do that?
We can't live without air.
I didn't know that Tom hated Mary.
Tom says Mary has always lived in Australia.
Tom told me he wasn't nervous.
Tom knows something we don't.
Tom said he was worried about Mary.
We all got into the car.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that or not.
Last night I picked up.
Tom isn't very good at bowling.
Tom said Mary gave him something.
Give me some water.
Tom said he wants to write a book.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
I don't think you've been paying attention.
We'll need more time.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary is doing.
Tom said Mary's gonna do that tomorrow.
You are both welcome to come with us.
I can't believe Tom's actually doing that.
It's not something anyone can do.
Tom said he ate too much.
We are all looking forward to your coming.
I think Tom won't stop doing that anytime soon.
Did I ever tell you guys about the first time I met Tom?
I started studying French when I was thirteen years old.
Tom said he wished he hadn't played chess with Mary.
I know that Tom will probably give you permission to do that.
Is it okay if I ask Tom to help me?
Tom said that Mary knew John might not have to do that by himself.
I wonder if Tom is motivated.
Tom said he would have done that if he thought it was necessary.
Tom didn't know you were supposed to do that.
I think Tom wouldn't like it if Mary did that.
I still wish you would.
Mary told me she wasn't planning to stay very long.
I didn't know you were going to be jealous.
Tom didn't know Mary had children.
They say they can't wait that long.
I'm surprised that you didn't know Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom may be lonely.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't very busy.
I'm absolutely sure that won't happen.
I think he's right.
Tom said he was glad you did that for Mary.
I think Tom knew where Mary was going to do that.
Tom has no idea where Mary is planning to do that.
Tom and Mary say they have to find someone to help them do that.
You're very annoying.
I have already finished reading this book.
I knew Tom wouldn't be a very good teacher.
I didn't know you were rich.
I should have told Tom to stay in Boston.
You've finished your homework, haven't you?
What could have happened?
I don't think Tom knows if Mary likes him or not.
I lost in the forest.
I know Tom is a good drummer, but I don't like him, so let's not ask him to join our band.
Tom told me he'll be in Boston next Monday.
Shut up!
Tom said he knew he might have to do that on Monday.
Tom said he regretted what had happened.
It's never too late to learn.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to do that.
Tom knew Mary was sick.
Have you got a pen on you?
Tom lets Mary do what she wants to do.
I'll wait until 2:30.
My parents won't let me do that.
I don't think Tom knows how much time it'll take for him to do that.
I don't think I want to do that here.
Why didn't you eat the food I cooked?
I know you're afraid of Tom.
Tom tried on his father's clothes.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary why he did that.
Tom said he's trying to do that every week.
You really have beautiful teeth! Are they real?
No one knew that Tom was the person who contributed most of the money.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't want to stay in Boston.
Tom said he didn't have to go to school tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was frustrated.
Tom and I were both a little confused.
I'm sure Tom knew that was going to happen.
Tom told me he thought he could do that.
I admitted I did what Tom said I shouldn't do.
Did you know that Tom and Mary have three children?
It's not just a minor problem.
I am not satisfied with your explanation.
I know Tom has finished doing that already.
I know you don't like me.
Tom said he wouldn't do what I asked him to do.
I know why Tom should've done that.
There must be a reason that Tom isn't here.
It's not right to be late for a dinner party.
Tom told me that he thought Mary could run faster than he could.
Tom said Mary is scared.
You should have been the last one to do that.
I know Tom is a farmer, but I don't know where his farm it is.
Tom says the matter is urgent.
Tom said Mary doesn't like doing that.
What could go wrong?
No one could have stopped that.
Tom said he had to share a hotel room with a stranger.
I know I said I'd do that, but I can't do it today.
I think Tom's overemotional.
I'm immune to smallpox.
Tom sometimes sleeps on my couch.
My class was canceled.
Tom and Mary told me to be gone by the time they got here.
Tom promised me he would be here by 2:30.
Tom said he thinks Mary can take care of herself.
It's not as cold here as I expected it to be.
Tom said he just got back from Australia.
I don't think I'll be alone.
I can't work now.
The game is about to begin.
Tom said Mary was born in Boston.
I think Tom won't be surprised.
I know Tom would be willing to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was jealous.
Does anyone else know you're here?
Tom said he wanted to go to the zoo.
Tom said he thought Mary was unhappy in Boston.
Didn't you know that Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I know Tom knew who was going to do that for me.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's not happy.
That's not my pen.
I don't think I can do this without Tom.
Tom said he didn't think the noise was bothering Mary.
No one ran.
Tom said Mary would probably do that.
I met someone who knows we.
Tom said he thought those shoes were too expensive.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that.
It was just a joke.
Tom said he hopes you can take care of yourself.
I'm not sure I feel the same thing.
I should've brought more food.
I'm worried that Tom will lose.
They told me they were next.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't as eager to do that now as they were yesterday.
They say they still need help.
I'm sorry I didn't have the opportunity to say goodbye to Tom.
Tom and Mary said they weren't ticklish.
I know that Tom did that just to make Mary jealous.
I know you're smarter than that.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.
That is not the main reason I want to do that.
Tom didn't look back.
I know I'm ugly.
Tom told me he called you.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
Tom and Mary told me they ate too much.
He's old enough to drive a car.
Tom said he thought he forgot to lock the door.
I know Tom's afraid people might laugh at him.
Tom said Mary was probably still going to be mad.
Tom and Mary say they feel better now.
They hate foreigners; I hate everyone.
Tom said he's not sure Mary can swim.
I don't know if Tom will come tomorrow or not.
They said they were very busy.
I promise we'll find a bigger place.
I think Tom is the only one to do that.
I didn't think you would win.
I don't think Tom will have the time to do that with us today.
I know Tom's very opinioned.
We cannot let these upstarts push us around.
I don't think Tom knows who Mary's boyfriend is.
I knew Tom knew who could do that and who couldn't.
Tom and Mary don't think they've ever met you.
Tom said Mary was worried about the weather.
Tom's not so sure.
Everyone here knows that we don't eat pork.
Let's hope that's the last time that happens.
I know Tom didn't know you shouldn't have done that.
I think Tom doesn't know how to do that.
I've already told Tom that I don't plan to do that.
I thought it would be fun to live in Boston for a year or two.
It's not healthy to skip meals.
I'm glad to meet you.
I know Tom can handle Mary.
I suspect Tom and Mary are the ones who did that.
I bet I can sit here longer without saying a thing than you can.
It's not done yet.
I know Tom's not on the team anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know he shouldn't do that.
Tom just turned on the radio.
Tom has already decided that he won't say yes.
I know that Tom is a bit snobbish.
What's in the box?
Tom said Mary knew he might not want to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they're not alone.
Tom said he would have done that by himself if he could have.
Admit that there is a problem is the first step to fix the problem.
Mary said she was planning on going.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be absent.
Tom said Mary lied.
I don't think Tom would be upset if I did that.
Tom and Mary said they wouldn't be there.

I don't think it's right.
I don't have to do anything I don't want to.
Tom and Mary weren't planning to do that until John asked them to.
If you left home a little earlier you would have been on time.
You cannot be too careful when driving.
Tom said Mary thought he might want to do that tonight.
Tell Tom I'm coming.
I would have bought more clothes if I had the money.
I thought I told you not to talk to my daughter.
Tom and Mary told me they just did that.
What are the chances Tom will win?
I'm afraid you can't.
I think Tom won't be gone by the time we get there.
Tom said he plans to stay in Boston.

That's not what I'm going to talk about.
Both Tom and John say they've kissed Mary.
Tom said he thought Mary was ready.
I know I've been lied to.
Tom is the one that's going to be punished.
It's a pity that you can't join us.
I know I'm supposed to do this.
I can't believe you did this.
Tom said he wanted to help.
Why do everyone think Tom and I are stupid?
What are the positive sides?
The battery indicator light shows that the battery is not being charged.
I thought you looked sad.
Tom said he doesn't plan to go.
You know I'm supposed to do that today, don't you?
I didn't think you realized what you were doing.
Tom said he's glad nobody was injured in the accident.
Tom said he's not upset.
Tom and Mary told me they'd rather go home.

I don't think people should do that.
I think this is a serious matter.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary really needs to do that.
Tom taught French to his friends.
I thought Tom couldn't be allowed to do that today.
Mr. Yoshida is home in French history.
I shouldn't have left early.
Are you exhausted?
I left as soon as I was asked.
I don't have anything to do!
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
I don't think I'm unreasonable.
Tom and Mary said everyone they know was to Boston.
They told us they could speak French.
You're deceiving yourself.
We talked to everyone.
Tom said Mary is probably still troubled by what happened.
I suppose you'll not come to work tomorrow.
It's become very hard for me to walk very far.
It's not deep enough.

I would have done that by myself if Tom hadn't been there.
I already knew that Tom was planning to do that.
Stop treating me like a kid.

You didn't know that you wouldn't be able to do that, did you?
Tom's interested.
I'm sure Tom will.
I know Tom's in his bedroom sounds sleeping.
I know that Tom knows that I hardly ever do that.
I think Tom will be furious.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be required to do that by himself.

Tom is used to do that.

I didn't realize that Tom wanted Mary to do that.
I don't think I'm going to be able to do that.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary used to work together.
I wish I could have done it by myself.
I need a little help.
I have serious doubts about their plans succeeding.
You could've saved me a trip if you just told me I didn't need to be here today.

I thought we could talk about anything.
Tom will unlikely want to do that.
That would be cool.
I know that's not enough.

Tom would have let you do that.

Tom and Mary said they just needed more time.
Tom does what he wants.

My name is unimportant.
Tom thought Mary taught French.
I don't think Tom knows I'm not single anymore.
Is it okay if I sit here?
Nothing is as important as peace.
I thought we'd get there on time, but we didn't.
Tom assumed everyone knew Mary was going to do that.
What are you going to do with that?
I thought you said you wanted to do that this morning.
I thought I was doing that by myself.
I realized Tom wasn't joking.
There's no chance Tom will forget to do that.
Tom didn't think Mary was the one who did that.
Prepare to die.
Tom said he was very tired.
Tom didn't seem to be aware that Mary hadn't done that yet.
It's been done before.

I thought you should know.
Tom said Mary has tried to do that all day.
It's a secret, so please don't tell anyone.
Even if it rains, I plan to do that.
Do you think Tom would've helped us?
Tom said he wanted to buy another car.
Tom has done that for over thirty years.

Mercury is the planet nearest to the sun.

That's not the way I would have done that.
I didn't know that Tom would be there.
I thought the end was perfect.

I know you and Tom skipped school yesterday.
No one said doing that would be easy.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary's doing that.
You said you'd help me.

I just hope it's not too late.
I don't think Tom's gonna win.

Thank you for sharing!
I thought you already knew about what happened.

Would it be okay if I went swimming?
Tom is usually a lot more tube than I am.

I know that Tom plans to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't eat the stew that Mary made for him.
Tom has no idea what Mary's house looks like.

Tom said Mary thought it was unlikely John would do that.
Where's the entrance to the underground car park?
They say they'll pay for everything.
Tom said he assumed you would do that.
They are fascinated by blood and violence.
Tom and Mary said they didn't want this.
No one knows exactly where Tom will go.
You should make sure you don't make Tom mad.
I didn't know that we weren't supposed to do that by ourselves.
Some think it's a bad idea.
How do I know you're not gonna try to kill me?
I wonder if Tom really went to Boston.
Tom said he considered doing that.
I don't think Tom will be by himself.
I can't figure out why he did that.
Tom didn't know why Mary was so angry.
Tom said Mary was likely to be out.
Why don't you put some clothes on?
That wasn't the main reason Tom shouldn't have done that.

It's not safe to text while you drive.

I'm learning Quechua.
It's Friday.
What's dinner tonight?

I'm about the same age as you are.
Tom said Mary didn't seem annoying.
We're changing our clothes.
Tom knows Mary should do that.
You knew Tom was a ballet dancer, didn't you?
Tom said he needed to get more sleep.
I think Tom knows why.
It's not like I don't want to do it.
I don't like cats and my brother doesn't either.
Tom is obviously very rich.
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who needs to do that.
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will do that.
I figured it had to be good.
It might be good to do that.
I thought Tom had seen me.
If I knew Tom's address, I would have written to him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was amused.
Tom thought Mary was charming.
Someone should have told Tom that he was doing that the wrong way.
I knew Tom shouldn't go outside.
Do you have vegetarian pilaf?
I know you need to go to Boston.
I knew Tom was a bum.
I got a question.
Tom takes a shower every morning.
Tom said Mary knew she might have to do that.
I think Tom could be just the person we need.
This isn't at all surprising.
I know Tom knows he's not supposed to do that.
I thought Tom would know how to do that.
I think Tom's doing that too.
Tom said he heard someone snoring.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will think it's a good idea to do that.
Tom knows time is running out.
I think it was Tom's mistake.
Tom said he thought Mary was having a good time in Australia.
Tom says he's planning on going to Australia with Mary.

I don't think you'll have the same problems that I had.
This book is worth reading twice.
Tom said he thought Mary would be ready to do that.
I wish that had happened.
It's not going to hurt.

You look like you're not having any fun.
I thought you wanted to go to Australia.
Tom told me he thought Mary was lost.
Tom said he was unable to do everything he had planned to do.
Tom said he didn't want to give a speech.
I suppose we're doing a pretty good job since no one has complained.

I hope I don't say anything stupid.
I'm sorry I took so long.
Tom's gonna be very sorry he didn't.
They told me they wouldn't do that.
I'm sorry I can't come today.
Both Tom and Mary are scared.
I thought Tom looked exhausted.
It's not likely to rain tomorrow.
I know I can rely on you.
I know that Tom did that right.
Stop criticizing me!
Tom says he didn't do it.
I'm looking for you.
Tom said he knew I wasn't going to cry.
Tom said we couldn't do anything about it.
I think Tom's just curious.
Everyone knows that Tom was the one who broke the window.
Here's my pink notebook.
I knew I could rely on you!
I don't think Tom knows what he wants.
I didn't know that Tom didn't need to do that by himself.
It's not like Tom's going anywhere.
Tom told me he was hesitant to do that.
I pretended I didn't know what to do.
I know Tom is a bum.
I didn't think Tom would allow you to do that.
I want to go and change into that shirt I bought yesterday.
Tom said he thought Mary was lying.
We should have stayed with you.
I don't think Tom's lonely.
This isn't the first time I did this.
If Tom can't do that, probably no one else can either.
I thought Tom could stop by this afternoon.
I think the economic impact will be minimal.
You should let Tom know that Mary's going to do that.
It would have been fun to do that.
Tom and Mary say they don't plan to do that anymore.
I don't think Tom will need our help.
Tom said Mary was feeling nervous.
Tom and Mary said they were over thirty.
I think Tom expected Mary to ask him to stay.

I'm not gay, but my boyfriend is.
You know that's not right.

I know Tom was at your house today.
Tom's not going to be able to do that by himself.
Tom and Mary said they were going to work.
Tom hasn't been told what happened yet.
Tom said he expected Mary to win.
Tom said Mary was unenthusiastic about that.
Tom said he wished he hadn't been so late.
They said they're suspicious.
Did you know Tom was planning to move to Boston?
Tom said that he assumed Mary would want to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't finished doing that.
I thought that was what we were supposed to do.
I would never do that to you.
Tom should have been faster in doing that than Mary.
Tom and Mary said they planned to go on Monday.
That's not what Tom really needs.
They know that they can do better.
There's no way Tom would have done what you say he did.
Tom said he wasn't allowed to do that anymore.
You're tired, aren't you?
Did Tom do that by himself?
Tom and Mary say they used to study French.
Tom admitted he killed Mary.
I would have been there by now if my car hadn't broken down.
We're brothers.
I wrote a long letter to Tom.
It's going to be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I don't think that giving Tom a knife was a good idea.
I thought you were gonna kill me.
I think there's a possibility that Tom will do that.
It's surprising that they should have a second house in America.
They told me they were depressed.
My mother can't drive a car at all.
There's a lot that's happening right now.
I wonder if Tom is rich.
It's not necessary for me to do that.
I didn't think anyone noticed what Tom did.
I think you're bossy.
Tom backed his car up to check, but the raccoon he had run over was dead as a doornail.
Tom and Mary said they're not mad.
I wonder if Tom has ever told Mary about what we did on that day.
Close that door.
The only reason Tom went to Australia because everyone else in his family did.
I thought Tom would ask Mary to the prom.
Are you sure you can't see us?
He has a great fancy for travelling.
Tom said Mary was probably still going to be in jail.
I'm not sure Tom would let anyone help Mary.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were jealous.
Tom and Mary told me they were homesick.
I think you know we need to buy some more food.
I'm surprised Tom didn't want to go with us.
I asked Tom and Mary if they knew anyone who taught French.
Tom must've left his umbrella on the bus.
They told me they're broken.
No one but Tom did that.
I don't think Tom will be surprised that that happened.
I suppose you're not interested in going with us.
It's not easy to understand by everyone.
I'm hungry.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who needed to do that.
I thought you might want something cold to drink.
Tom told me he wouldn't go to Boston unless I went with him.
No one's seen them.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sleepy.
Tom said he would definitely do that this week.
That's not my responsibility.
I think Tom is a student at Harvard.
I didn't know I was doing that the wrong way.
That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Tom told Mary that he didn't think John was happy that would happen.
If it hadn't been for the storm, I would have arrived earlier.
They said they would do that for us.
I thought you were only dating girls who were shorter than you.
Tom said he thought prices at that store were too high.
Tom said he didn't feel like eating.
Tom spends a lot of money buying things he never uses.
I thought you said I could count on you.
Tom said he sold his car three weeks ago.
Tom spent the money his grandmother had given him on books.
This is the first time I've been away from my family for more than three weeks.
You should have said that at that time.
Tom and Mary say they'll only talk to you.
Tom told me he didn't have as many friends as Mary did.
I've parked my car here many times and nobody's complained.
Tom said he was sad.
Tom said he didn't think Mary needed to tell John what to do.
Tom said he was going back home.
I didn't know Tom was going to be arrested.
I know I'm gonna regret this.
Tom thought Mary was bored.
Tom thought Mary would be ready to do that.
Do you have any idea when Tom is planning to get here?
I know you're not planning to stay in Boston.
I wonder if that could happen again.
I suspect Tom and Mary are from Boston.
I couldn't stay looking at it.
I think Tom doesn't know Mary can speak French.
The evidence currently available does not allow me to make such a claim.
Tom said he's very sure Mary has to do that.
Tom would have been happy if you had done that.
Tom said he wants to talk to you.
I thought you were a doctor.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's phone number.
Tom said he needed to stay home.
I thought you were happy.
I could have stopped it.
It's not healthy to eat and run.
I didn't think Tom would be forgiven.
Tom said Mary was asked not to do that.
We're invited to dinner.
Tom and Mary said they felt repulsed.
I know Tom's afraid he'll be lost.
I ate the same thing Tom did.
I know that Tom would be able to convince Mary to do that if he tried.
Tom thinks I'm missing a great opportunity.
I know that Tom isn't a very good guitar player.
Tom and I were both impressed.
Everyone knows Tom is lying.
They're not as young as they say they are.
Don't expect anyone to help you.
Did you know Tom wasn't planning to do that?
I never thought I was going there.
You know that's not true.
I know Tom and Mary have already left Australia.
You're not like anyone else I know.
Tom and Mary said they felt the same.
Tom is probably planning to stay in Boston until October.
Tom thought you could take care of yourself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
Tom has decided that he's not going to work today.
Tom refused that he was the one who asked Mary to do that.
I wish I could speak French as well as Tom.
That's not happening!
I knew Tom wouldn't be caught.
It's not going to work out.
I'm afraid I need to ask you a few questions.
Tom said that Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that.
I think Tom lives in Australia.
Tom told Mary and I that we should try to do that by ourselves.
You know it's not like that.
I wouldn't have been able to do that without your help.
I knew Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.
Tom said he's looking forward to his retirement.
Whether we do that now or later doesn't matter.
Let's hope things stay this way.
I should've expected Tom wouldn't get along with Mary.
I think it's very unlikely that Tom was not aware that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the museum without his parents.
I wonder if Tom really knows the combination to this safe.
Someone's singing.
Mary doesn't plan to do that until I tell her to.
I didn't know you were supposed to do that this afternoon.
Tom said he thought he knew the cause of the accident.
I didn't realize Tom didn't like Mary.
I don't think that can be fixed.
I didn't think Tom really wanted to know.
Tom didn't even know that Mary used to live in Boston.
I didn't know you needed to do that today.
You should have registered your children months ago.
I think that's not mine.
I think Tom is thirty years old.
Think about it.
I told Tom you were coming to Australia.
I didn't think anyone would like Tom.
I thought Tom might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I didn't think anyone had ever done that kind of thing before.
Tom didn't know Mary was planning to stay.
That's not something I know how to do.
I think I'll be able to fix it myself.
I didn't think anyone did that.
Tom said we'd be lost.
Tom said he should do that.
Are you sure Mary said she was planning to do that tomorrow?
There were times I would have been lost without Tom.
I know you're interested.
Tom told me he thought Mary was insane.
Tom already knows Mary did that.
You're not as smart as Tom.
I don't think I really need to do that.
I promise I won't tell anyone where you are.
It's not going to end well.
I think I need someone to help me.
Tom wrote in all caps.
Tom will be very happy he didn't.
I don't think Tom needs to do that alone.
If I were you, I would go home at once.
It's not like you knew what they were going to do.
Tom and I are planning to stay together.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
So what are you suggesting?
Tom said he learned something new.
I know Tom's married.
Tom said he thought the economy was in bad shape.
I thought you were jury-run something.
I've been studying English for three years.
Tom is the only man I'd ever consider marrying.
I didn't think Tom would be awake when I got home.
Tom told me he thought Mary was paralyzed.
I know Tom's not planning to do that.
Tom didn't know you were from Boston.
It's not as hard as it sounds.
Tom and Mary shouted, but no one heard them.
Tom and Mary say they want to swimming.
Tom said Mary was probably still to be lonely.
I didn't think Tom would be arrested.
Tom told Mary that he wasn't planning to join the team.
You promised not to be rude to me any more.
Tom thought it would take longer.
I wonder if Tom knew he needed to do that.
I think Tom's like that.
Tom had all kinds of problems.
I knew Tom would like you to do that for him.
I thought Tom would want to see this movie.
I think Tom's still unecided.
I'm Tom's dad.
I just want to let you know that I think you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
Tom said he'd do his homework before dinner.
Tom stared at Mary and said nothing.
I wonder if Tom's really sleeping.
Tom and Mary said they want to die.
Tom said he's had enough of that.
I suspect Tom's on vacation.
Tom told me he was too tired to study tonight, so he just wanted to watch TV.
I don't think Tom's very bright.
Tom said he thought Mary needed to do that before John got here.
Doing that would have been easy.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that by himself.
That's very good.
Tom says he wasn't the one who broke the window.
It was clear that Tom was going to do that.
They're not sure they should do that.
The kind of information we need is not always available.
I'd rather not talk about it.
I didn't think anyone saw us.
We can't turn back.
I know Tom knows we shouldn't do that.
You didn't know I didn't need to do that, did you?
Tom suspected it was too late to help Mary.
Tom and I both sat down back.
Tom was wearing thetie that Mary gave him.
Tom and Mary said they weren't alone.
The question is not as much as it looks.
I know Tom's almost always right, but this time he's not.
Tom said that wouldn't be dangerous.
You're my hero, Sami.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom said he felt insulted.
Tom knew Mary would win.
Tom and Mary said they don't want this.
It's not about them.
I thought you said you wanted to do that by yourself.
Tom must have had a key.
Tom knew that there was a possibility that Mary would do that.
You're so fazy.
Tom and Mary said they weren't Canadian.
Tom and Mary told me they were famed.
It is not socially acceptable to point to people.
Tom would have allowed Mary to do that.
I wish we would stay in Australia for another week.
Here's the map you were looking for.
I thought you said you'd never do that again.
Tom knows why Mary is planning to go to Australia.
I wonder if we have to do that.
I know that Tom will never forgive Mary for doing that.
This is the third time this week Tom did that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are going to say anything about what happened.
I know Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do that today.
Tom says everyone he knows can swim.
Tom said he had a shovel in his pickup truck.
It was clear that Tom liked to do that by himself.
I don't think what I did was wrong.
I knew Tom was afraid.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia for a long time.
I figured I'd find you here.
It's not clear who wrote this letter.
They must have been tired.
Tom's okay.
Tom said he thought he didn't need to do that.
Tom said Mary knew that he might not want to do that until John had time to help him.
I didn't think Tom would like that.
I should never have brought you into this.
I think everyone trusts me.
I was surprised when Tom told me he wanted to do that.
I hope I'll see Tom tomorrow.
How much water does it take to fill your swimming pool?
Tom said Mary is probably still grouchy.
Tom said that he thought that Mary would unlikely want to do that.
Tom said he was coming, but he never showed up.
I doubt that Tom has the courage to do what really needs to be done.
Tom says he doesn't believe Mary really plans to do that this week.
Tom's going to be able to do that eventually.
The doctor advised me to leave jogging because it was excessive exercise.
Tom said he wasn't ready, but Mary said she was.
I don't think Tom will be back.
Nobody was on the bus.
Tom said he hoped Mary could win.
Tom thought he lost his wallet, but eventually found it after searching the house for an hour or so.
Tom told me he wasn't impressed.
I didn't think anyone really expected you to be here.
It was clear that Tom hadn't done that yet.
Tom and Mary are planning to go to every bar on this street.
Tom said he thought I might have to do that soon.
Did you know your socks don't match?
You know that's gonna have to be done today, don't you?
I think Tom's about to start crying.
She took him by the arm.
Tom said he felt intimidated.
It's not worth the effort.
Someone's waiting in your office.
I'm sorry we dragged you into this.
Tom said he's not thirsty.
Tom told me Mary did that wrong.
I knew that Tom might get hurt if he tried to do that.
Isn't that what you would have done?
Tom told me he thought Mary would be courteous.
I guess that's not really important.
Why's Tom wearing a cape?
Tom said Mary was able to do that too.
That's a mistake a lot of people make.
I don't think I'll be in Australia next week.
I know Tom didn't know I couldn't do that.
I know Tom is a lot younger than Mary is.
It's not a easy solution.
Tom said his mother never loved him.
Tom should have stayed longer.
Tom knows he's in real trouble now.
There's no doubt that Tom will do that for us.
I don't have anything I need to say to Tom.
I don't think Tom knows what I'm planning to do.
The men wear short slides.
Tom said he'd take care of Mary.
I knew that this would eventually happen.
It's not hard to guess what's going to happen.
Tom will never hurt anyone.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not be required to do that by herself.
I thought everyone knew.
I'm afraid I don't know.
Beauty lies in the eyes of the one who sees.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would be amused by what was happening.
Tom said he'd be home for dinner.
It's not a secret anymore.
Tom told me he didn't know Mary.
Tom didn't want anyone to get mad.
Tom thought Mary was John's girlfriend.
I can't stand this noise.
I know Tom's a lot better doing that than Mary.
The police believe Tom and Mary were murdered.
I guarantee that's not going to happen.
Tom claims he was born in 2013.
I don't think Tom's tough.
Tom has decided that he's going to say yes.
I hope Tom's not dead.
They said they don't do that.
Tom knows this is a hard situation.
Tom knew that what he was going to do would make Mary angry.
Tom could have done that without Mary's help.
Tom thought he might not be required to do that.
Tom asked Mary if John was planning to stay.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be mad.
Tom said Mary was willing to do the cooking.
I hope I don't start crying.
You should have done that with us.
I don't think it's impossible.
I know Tom is a pretty good swimmer.
Tom hasn't been appointed chairman yet.
I wonder if there's any cheese left in the refrigerator.
What are you good at?
I wonder if Tom and Mary were supposed to do that.
Tom said he didn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want to work late.
I suspect Tom and Mary both have houses in Australia.

I wonder if Tom is reliable.
I think Tom's gonna do that too.
I knew Tom was studying.
I know Tom is a gun owner.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get to the station by taxi.
Nobody has done it yet.
Tom said he didn't want me to worry.
I know Tom will do that with me this afternoon.
We're not planning to do that together.
Let's check why your answers differ from mine.
They told me they disagreed.
I don't think Tom was upset.
Tom knows he should do that, but he doesn't want to.
Tom is also a member of our group.
My parents don't allow me to do that.
They told me they didn't win.
Tom said he wasn't having fun.
I think Tom was in love with Mary.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
They say they like marigolds.
"Is everyone talking about me?" "No, Tom. You're not that important."
I don't think it'll be hard to do that.
It's not something I'm proud of.
Are Tom and Mary still sick?
I can't believe you did that.
I knew Tom wasn't finished doing that yet.
I don't think it's worth the price you paid for it.
I think Tom should go home.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be alone.
I promise I won't hit anyone.
Tom said he was trying to do that today.
Both Tom and Mary used to live on Park Street.
I know Tom knows Mary should do that.

The joke's on you.
I'm determined to give up smoking.
I thought maybe I'd better not go home right away.

Tom and Mary should never have done that together.
Every man cannot be happy.
I promise I won't.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
I swear I'll tell you everything someday.
Forty-four Americans have now taken the presidential oath. The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, each so often, the oath is taken in the middle of gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, America has not carried on simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forearers, and true to our founding documents.
Tom didn't know Mary had gone to Boston.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom wanted to do that.
Tom says he intends to win.
I know that Tom seldom does that more.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still alone.
I don't think I would enjoy doing that outside in the winter.
The germ spread quickly.
There's no way you're going out dressed like that.
If we don't take the threat of meteor strikes seriously, we all will die.
You're embarrassing.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary has to do that tomorrow.
It's not that weird, is it?
I didn't know I was violating any laws.
Do you promise me you'll do that?
You should tell Tom he's not likely to win.
They say they're willing to help.
There's a possibility that it's real.
I know I did the right thing.

I thought you were going to stay with Tom.
I don't think Tom's involved.
Tom said he doesn't plan to do that by himself.
Tom said Mary thought he might want to do that tonight.
I thought Tom had already been compensated for that.

There's a chance that Tom was wrong.

I know Tom doesn't know Mary shouldn't do that.
I know Tom is an selfish person.
Mary says she's not planning on going.
Are you planning to do that?
I'm sorry Tom had to leave so early.

There's nothing to apologize for.
I'd rather go swimming.
I've been planning to do that for months.

Tom couldn't find what he was looking for.
I didn't know you were going to be nervous.

I know you should do that.
I was surprised Tom didn't come yesterday.
A true friend would have helped.
I know Tom will love it.
Tom told me he thought I should lose some weight.
Tom said he'd rather do that next week.
I think Tom is prejudiced.
I thought it was a mistake to tell Tom where we buried the treasure.
I haven't called back yet.
Tom said Mary didn't look much older than John.
Tom is probably a bit younger than I am.
You're out of danger.
It's not worth repairing this camera.
I know that's not the truth.

Hello again.
The show is on Wednesday.
I'm at home right now.
I soon found out that I wasn't talented enough.

Go away and leave me alone!
You should tell Tom that Mary's planning to do that.
It's not always easy to tell the difference between good and bad.
Tom's even lazier than Mary.
That's not funny.
I don't think anyone could have stopped Tom.
Tom didn't think he had a chance to succeed, but he at least wanted to give it a shot.
I suspect Tom's already left for Australia.

What will the neighbors think?

Let's hope that's enough time.

It is not particularly hot today.
I wasn't as successful as Tom.

If you don't go, I won't either.
What are your plans?
Tom and Mary say they're not ready to go.
I know Tom doesn't know I shouldn't do that.
Tom thought Mary didn't like him.
Tom said he didn't do anything illegal.
Tom said he already did that.
I think you're gonna be okay.
I knew Tom was still willing to do that.

The computer has stopped working.
We know you're not stupid.
She didn't turn up after all.
We both know that's a lie.

I didn't think Tom would be awake at this time of night.
I didn't think Tom would be stupid enough to do something like that.
I don't think Tom's in Australia now.

Tom's flaty.
It's not always easy to face reality.
Tom says he won't win.
Tom was aware that they were following him.
What the hell was that supposed to mean?
I know I'm in big trouble now.
Why don't you ever do what I tell you to do?
Tom decided the best thing was to let Mary go to Australia.
Tom would never have done that if Mary had asked him not to.
I thought you said you weren't interested.
It was harder to do that than Tom said it would be.
I don't think Tom's going to Australia with Mary.
I'm so tired.
I'm 18 years old.
They're not coming.
Tom probably doesn't know the rules yet.
Let's hope you're cured.
I know someone should do that.
I can't speak French as well as you.
You should have listened to Tom more carefully.

What's your favorite fast-food restaurant?
Why is Tom wearing that hat?

They said they would never want to do that.
They said they would eat fruit.
Tom said he didn't have to do that now.
I thought you wouldn't like Boston.
I think there's a good chance it'll rain tonight.
I love you and I will always.
No.
I know Tom's not a very good heater.
I don't think I'm the best person for the job.
They say they would be willing to help us.
It's not open for debate.
Tom told everyone he was unemployed.
I know that'll be hard to do.
How are you planning to do that?
It's beyond me.
I'm a bit out of shape!
Didn't you know that Tom was seeing someone else?
It's going to be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
I should have been more careful.
Tom and Mary thought they were cute.
I thought you had learned that right now.
I never said I could understand French.
Tom is just as smart as Mary.
They wished that they hadn't said that.
I wonder if Tom's planning to quit his job.
Tom told me that he hoped Mary would be motivated to do that.
I'm going crazy.
Tom thought Mary would be embarrassed.
I hope I get a chance to go to Boston.
I'm glad no one's around.
Tom said he hoped Mary would like the gift he was planning to give her.
I don't think we have a choice.
Tom couldn't defend himself.
Do what Tom tells you to do.
Saturday is the last day of the week.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary would be grumpy.
I know Tom knows why we didn't do that on Monday.
Who is your favorite singer?
I promise I'll help you.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not want to do that again.
Tom thinks he left his umbrella on the train.
I'm a lot more than Tom.
I know Tom can speak French. I wonder if Mary can, too.
I know that Tom would be faster doing that than Mary.
My handwriting is better than Tom's.
Hello, what's your name?
They say they won't be here tomorrow.
Tom said he had a lot of fun in Boston.
I suppose this is due to the fact that Tom is a minor.
I always suspected Tom was a little paranoid.
I know Tom knew that I was planning to do that.
You should have been able to do that much better.
We work every day but Monday.
I know you weren't the ones who did that.
Tom said he doesn't have the power to stop it.
I know Tom and Mary are married.
I should have been here yesterday.
It's not heavy.
That's why Tom went to Australia.
I thought you were excited that I was getting married.
Tom told me he would probably cry.
I thought they'd find someone else.
I was the only one there who knew that Tom didn't want to do that.
I doubt very seriously that Tom did that on purpose.
I figured you might be busy now.
Tom said he thought we should do that by ourselves.
I don't think this is an exception.
I know you don't like me very much.
I thought it was unnecessary for us to do anything about that today.
Tom has a lot of things he wants to do today.
Tom said something about that the other night.
Tom admitted he wasn't brave.
I know I should have done that.
Tom said he didn't want to stay in Boston any longer.
I suspect Tom's waiting for us.
Hunds who are dead can't bite.
I don't think Tom's as crazy as some people think.
I don't think I'll be able to do that by myself.
Tom doesn't think we'll find anyone who can do that for us.
She avoided his eyes.
Tom isn't as fat as I am.
I don't think Tom and I can do that by ourselves.
Tom says Mary's still planning to do that.
I thought Tom must be mistaken.
Tom said Mary didn't care what he did.
They said they didn't like this.
Tom was the reason Mary moved to Boston.
I should have introduced myself.
Tom said Mary is looking forward to being retired.
I can't remember when he moved to Boston.
I've never fell in love with anyone.
This is the first time Tom ever complained about that.
Tom is liked by everyone.
I didn't think anyone thought you were crazy.
He hasn't got a mobile.
I think Tom will ask you to marry him.
Tom said Mary thought John might not be allowed to do that by himself.
There's no need for Tom to do that.
Tom said he didn't have permission to do that.
I suspect Tom's involved.
How many kilos have you lost?
Tom and Mary are okay.
I'm a despicable human being.
I'll never forget the time you and I went to Australia together.
Tom's not the only one who plans to stay with us tonight.
Tom and Mary have both decided not to leave.
Tom told me he's sleepy.
Mary tried on her mother's clothes.
Tom admitted that he stole Mary's bicycle.
I prided off the lid.
Tom said Mary was likely to be in Australia now.
Tom said he doesn't want to do that here.
I'm three years older than you are.
When's your birthday?
They said they were hurt.
It's obvious that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
I would have helped you.
I didn't know that Tom and Mary were already married.
I didn't hurt anyone.
We cannot play baseball here.
Tom and Mary say they won't mind.
I'm not in the mood.
I thought you said you had fun doing that.
Where did you learn to do that?
I don't think Tom and Mary know anyone in Boston.
I've been on a diet for more than a year.
Tom said he wasn't willing to help us do that.
Tom thought Mary had already a driver's license.
I know Tom is a pretty good drummer.
Tom realized that he wouldn't be able to change anything.
Tom said Mary should've done that alone.
I didn't know you were still living with your parents.
Tom said he wanted to buy a weather fan.
Didn't you know Tom was Canadian?
Come on, guys, this isn't funny anymore.
I suspect Tom's at home, sleeping.
Tom and Mary told me they would do that again.
Tom threw up.
Tom doesn't like this color.
Tom must have left the water running.
I'm a farmer.
It's not easy to get married to Tom.
I didn't know there was a swimming pool here.
Tom and Mary say they're not concerned.
Tom didn't stay in Boston for as long as he wanted.
Tom said he's a Canadian.
I'd like to have another cup of coffee.
I suppose Tom's still married to Mary.
Tom said everyone he knows enjoys doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were here yesterday.
I know that Tom can probably do that sometime today.
Do you let your children play in the street?
I can't believe Tom and Mary are gone.
Tom doubts that Mary can do that.
There is a cat under the desk.
I think Tom is unkind.
I don't think Tom knows when it happened.
Is it true Tom's moving to Boston?
Tom said he didn't want to live in Australia anymore.
I thought you looked tired.
Tom said I looked impatient.
I think Tom could make Mary do that.
I'm interested in chess these days.
I don't think I would like to live in Australia.
Tom said Mary should've done that by herself.
My parents died when I was three.
I think Tom was misled.
What you're saying is absolutely wrong.
He's depressed.
I know I have to help Tom tomorrow.
I don't think Tom has a girlfriend now.
Tom said Mary is thirsty.
They said they didn't like doing that.
I'm peeling apples.
They said they would never study French.
They said they thought I was creative.
Tom told me he's uncertain what he should do.
Tom told me I should have said yes.
Tom didn't press the button.
There was nothing left in the fridge.
Tom said he knew that Mary might not have to do that.
I knew Tom wouldn't have to do that.
Tom said he didn't know that Mary couldn't speak French very well.
I don't think there's any chance I'll get there on time.
I think Tom and Mary are going to be busy tomorrow.
Tom said he knew I might have to do that.
Tom said he didn't want Mary to do that.
Tom said he doesn't plan to go with us this weekend.
I don't think Tom's sure that's what Mary wants to do.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to buy what he needed for three hundred dollars.
Everyone loves free stuff.
I don't think this is funny.
If Tom does that, I will, too.
I know Tom's still in his office.
Tom and Mary said they're prepared to help me.
Tom's not the one who told me Mary should do that.
I thought you said you would still like to do that.
Tom said he was wondering if Mary wanted to do that or not.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom's a very nice boy.
Tom and Mary said they didn't really expect anyone to do that.
Tom said it was Mary who told him to do that.
Tom doesn't think Mary's annoyed.
I don't think I can hold on much longer.
Tom is not as much as Mary.
Tom said he didn't think the heat was bothering Mary.
I know you're a coward.
You're lying!
I told Tom I disagreed.
I think Tom's talking to Mary now.
I've already promised Tom I'd help him.
I think everyone deserves a chance.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to be at the meeting.
Tom doesn't know I have to do that today.
I don't think you really want to pay attention to that.
Tom said he knew that Mary was the one who did that.
I thought Tom and Mary were going to kill John.
Leave the lights on, please.
Tom said Australia is a nice place to visit.
I thought Tom was in big trouble.
I listened to everyone.
It doesn't work.
Tom's speech lasted for three hours.
I wonder if Tom's alive.
I might try to borrow a hatch from Tom.
Tom may be surprised.
I don't think anyone would want to see that movie more than once.
I can't remember anything else at this time.
Tom needs to know that somebody cares.
I think Tom won't be in Australia very long.
Tom told Mary he would never come back here.
I didn't know you couldn't do that by yourself.
I suspect Tom will never agree to do that.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary wants to buy.
He can't stop me.
I think Tom is unresponsible.
I thought it would be fun to live in Australia for a year or two.
I know that Tom is more likely to do that today than he was yesterday.
I think Tom's doing something illegal.
Our streets flood when we have rain.
I'll probably be busy this afternoon.
I don't think you have a lot of choice.
Tom said he thought he might do that on October 20th.
Tom and Mary said they didn't know where John was planning to do that.
I knew that Tom might be allowed to do that again.
Tom gave me the last piece of cake.
I know Tom is a very good drummer.
We know you're working for them.
Everyone here except Tom has done that.
I think you should do it yourself.
I think everyone has an idea of what Tom is capable of.
Tom knew he could have done that better.
Tom said he wished Mary wouldn't do that by herself.
Tom told me he thought Mary was displeased.
I wonder if it's safe to camp here.
Tom said they wouldn't let him do that.
I'm a university student.
I think Tom didn't, but I could be wrong.
Which country are you from?
Tom and I are both students.
I don't think I made enough spaghetti for everyone.
I know that Tom is the one who's supposed to tell Mary that she needs to do that.
I don't think it would be a good idea to do that by ourselves.
Are you saying you don't want to do this?
I know that Tom can't stop me from doing that.
I can assure you that won't happen.
Tom plans to sit in the back.
Tom said he gave a book to Mary.
It would have been unarable.
I know that Tom will probably know how to do that.
I know Tom was a scary kid.
Tom said he had no reason to stay.
Tom and Mary know they're partly blamed.
I'm not surprised that Tom plans to do that.
Hardly anyone expected Tom to win.
Don't contend my words!
I didn't think Tom realized how hard that job was going to be.
Tom and Mary are waiting for someone to help them.
Why don't you put on your jacket if you're cold?
Tom knows he can trust me.
Tom told Mary he wasn't planning to stay in Australia very long.
I hear you gave up smoking.
Tom obviously doesn't want to do that.
I don't think Tom really likes doing that very much.
Tom may be awake now.
It's not reasonable.
Tom told me he thought Mary was divorced.
Tom told me he was next.
Tom said that Mary knew John might have to do that by himself.
Tom said he was good talking French.
This is not salt.
Did anyone see Tom here?
Tom told me he thought Mary was wrong.
My dog sleeps in the same room I do.
He didn't keep his word.
I know that's not true.
Tom said he's planning to do that.
I suspect Tom and Mary want to do that as soon as possible.
I know that Tom can speak French better than I can.
I suspect Tom and Mary want us to help them do that tomorrow.
I know you're not ready to deal with this.
Tom and Mary said they acted in self-defense.
Tom told me he thought Mary had been careful.
Tom was sleeping on the living room sofa.
I found out both Tom and Mary like romance novels.
Tom knows I didn't do that yesterday.
I suspect Tom and Mary were busy all day.
Tom told everyone he was prepared to do that.
We'll go on a picnic if it's fine tomorrow.
Promise me you won't tell anyone
It's not Tom who needs protection.
They said they're irritated.
I think Tom will probably be able to do that.
Tom did that whenever he could.
They said that their houses weren't for sale.
I'm not fat.
I thought I wouldn't be able to do that.
I think we have more important things we should do now.
I think Tom and Mary have been to Boston at least once.
I don't think I know anyone here.
They say they want to win.
Tom knew Mary was a teacher.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be sleepy.
Can anyone please help me?
I know Tom's about the same age as your daughter.
I know Tom's a very lucky guy.
Tom thought I might not be allowed to do that by myself.
Tom thought he could do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's getting easy.
I think Tom will be lonely.
It looks like Tom likes everyone.
I'm surprised Tom wasn't here yesterday.
Mary's got to settle in her new flat.
Tom and Mary said they spoke French last week.
I don't think you need to tell Tom you plan to do that.
They swore they never did that.
Everyone stood there, shocked.
I'm looking forward to hearing why you think we should do that.
Tom told me he wasn't offended.
I'm sorry I wasn't as careful as I shouldn't have been.
Tom doesn't look too good.
Tom said he thought I should do that by myself.
I don't think Tom looks like his brother.
Tom said he heard noises in the kitchen.
I don't think Tom knows if Mary's sleepy or not.
I know I made a mistake.
You were surprised that I did that, weren't you?
They wished that they could fly.
What a beautiful sunset!
I've seen Mt. Fuji.
Tom didn't know that the bridge was closed.
They said they don't like to do that.
I thought Tom would have found Mary right now.
Tom said he wouldn't mind if Mary did that.
You shouldn't just assume Tom's guilty.
Watch yourself.
Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Someone has to tell Tom what to do.
I didn't know that Tom did that when he was thirteen.
Tom said he doesn't think you can win.
Tom and I are both vegetarians.
Tom said that I was the only one who thanked him.
Enough is enough!
I wonder if Tom knew I needed to do that.
Did you know Tom did that?
I guess it's like that everywhere.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Boston when they were children.
It's not until you lose your health that you realize its value.
That could have hit me.
They told me they're losing weight.
My house isn't big.
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't.
You didn't know I was still planning to join the team, did you?
The bathroom wasn't very clean.
They said they were safe.
Tom said he didn't think he would ever be able to convince Mary to go out with him.
Tom thought Mary would be the first to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was ambitious.
This is something I made for you.
I don't think I'm drunk enough to enjoy this kind of music.
Tom said he thought he could do that if he had some help.
Except for Tom, everyone did that.
She's been sick for three weeks.
Tom said he wished he could speak French better.
I can't dance.
Tom hasn't got a prayer.
Tom said he thought you could take care of yourself.
I know that Tom knew I was the one who had to do that.
Tom's not missing, is he?
I left my umbrella in the phone booth.
I did a bad thing.
I suspect Tom would be interested in doing that.
I promised Tom that I would.
I thought Tom would never show up.
That's too good to be true.
Tom said that would be fun.
Tom found it hard to be obedient.
Courgettes are green.
I should never have broken up with Mary.
I wish I was in Australia right now.
Tom knew I'd be early.
Tom poured his dog some bread.
What does this have to do with us?
How do I know you're telling me the truth?
Tom didn't know I was supposed to do that.
That's just not possible.
I'm afraid we can't do anything.
I'm pretty sure I can do that.
Tom says that he and Mary will spend Christmas Day together.
Why did you fail in the entrance examination?
Tom found it hard to remain impartial.
Tom told me he had to leave.
Tom says he can't prove Mary did that.
Tom and Mary told everyone that they were bored.
Tom said he's glad you're coming.
Tom thought Mary was really mean.
I know there will be a lot of good food at the picnic.
Does anyone have any questions so far?
I suspect Tom's reluctant to do that.
Tom was never afraid of anyone.
They said they'd rather come next week.
What are you referring to?
Tom said that he thought Mary was amused by what was going on.
Everyone in the room did the same thing.
They are inseparable.
Tom didn't know you were the one who wanted to do that.
They promised they wouldn't do that.
I really thought Tom would do that.
You must've done that last year.
Could you take a picture of me?
We should've expected that to happen.
It would have been wise to do that.
Tom told me he didn't have a problem with that.
Tom said Mary shouldn't have walked home by herself.
Tom has to be irritated.
For how long has your head hurt?
Thank you, Bud!
Tom said nobody was fired.
Do you think we should have gone where Tom wanted us to go instead of coming here?
He has earache.
I don't think Tom wants to do that by himself.
I'm not sure I can trust Tom.
Tom said it was Mary who told him he needed to do that.
Tom was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
I suppose the gunshot I heard was the one who killed Tom.
It's not just my problem.
Tom told me he thought Mary was high.
I know Tom is a millionaire.
Tom said he thought that doing that would be safe.
I don't think I'll allow Tom to do that.
No pain, no gain.
I admit I've done that.
I think Tom doesn't eat meat.
I hope we don't have problems with Tom.
Here's your bag.
This is the first time Tom ever complained about the noise.
I'll never tell anyone.
Tom didn't know Mary was a Canadian.
I think Tom is a good coach.
Tom and Mary told me they could help us.
I don't think it's unethical for you to do that.
Tom said he thought he might be the only one who knew where Mary lived.
I know we can't count on Tom to do that for us.
I thought Tom dumped Mary a month ago.
I think Tom won't be the last to do that.
Tom would have done the same thing you did.
I don't think Tom's downstairs.
I need to know that we can depend on Tom.
Tom said Mary thought he might not be allowed to do that.
I realize that isn't very likely to happen.
They say that drugs are not safe.
I know it's very unlikely anyone can help me.
I think Tom's gonna call you.
I didn't know you were such a superstitious person.
Tom said that he thought it would be a huge mistake to tell Mary what had happened.
Tom thought Mary would probably not cry.
This work is enough to break my back.
That would never have happened if you did what I told you to do.
I wonder if Tom wanted to go to Boston with us.
I can't.
We need to replace our water heater.
Does anyone have a kleenex?
Tom told us that he thought he could become a famous singer.
We've already done that.
Tom is a hemophiliac.
I wouldn't have said anything.
Tom said he would be happy to answer any questions we had.
Tom said he knew you could do that.
Tom and I are both wrong.
I assume you still enjoy drinking bear.
I wonder if Tom and Mary were able to do that.
What's your mother's name?
I don't think Tom is the person you should talk to.
Sami knows what I'm talking about.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do this.
Tom said I had to study French.
You're not obliged to do that, are you?
You have a big head.
He's very smart.
I would never have hired Tom.
Does Tom know you've already done that?
Tom did more than I did.
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last Monday.
Tom said he didn't think anyone could do that.
Tom said Mary is probably still willing to do that.
Did anyone go to Australia with you?
Tom said he thought I would want to do that.
Tom said he wanted me to show him how to do that.
I hope this is enough food for everyone.
Tom said I shouldn't leave sooner.
I know that Tom knows that Mary will never be able to do that.
Tom said I should come home soon.
Tom and Mary are going to get hurt if they're not careful.
Tom would have done that.
I didn't know that Tom told Mary he wasn't going to do that.
I would like to visit Boston again.
With teaching and studying my time is taken up.
I think Tom's conceived.
I don't think Tom would like it if we did that.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary won't be able to do that.
They say they'll quit doing that.
Tom's incompetent.
Tom thinks Mary drinks like a fish.
I know I didn't have to do that, but I'm glad I did.
Tom said he thought he wouldn't enjoy traveling with Mary.
Tom and Mary said they told you.
Tom said he thinks Mary can't do that.
I know Tom is a golfer, perhaps he could teach you how to play.
I thought you knew Tom and Mary were married.
I knew that Tom would be able to do that without some help.
I suggest you're not going to Australia in the winter.
What else are you planning to do?
I think Tom understood everything.
I know you're happy about that.
Tom's downstairs.
I know Tom's talking.
It's not my business.
Mary has a big map collection.
I knew Tom wouldn't have enough money.
Tom says you're willing to help.
I suppose you would like to meet Tom.
I don't think Tom knows when Mary got back from Boston.
I wonder if Tom kissed Mary good night last night.
I don't think anyone saw us.
I knew Tom wasn't a bad student.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
Is it hard to milk a goat?
Do you think we'll ever find our way back to the campsite?
Tom doesn't know I have three cats.
I should have quit while I was ahead.
Is anyone alive here?
I thought I told you to keep the door closed.
My grandmother texts faster than you.
Do Tom and Mary live in Boston?
Let's hit the slopes!
What's your favorite word?
Tom knows he made the right choice.
I thought you said you were doing that for Tom.
I didn't think anyone noticed what you did.
I wonder if I could help Tom.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interesting.
You're not the only one here who can speak French, are you?
Get out of here.
I know this isn't hard.
I suspect Tom and Mary aren't ready to do that yet.
I thought you might be hungry.
I assumed Tom had told you I would be here.
Did you know Tom was going to be in Australia every week?
Tom said he didn't know that eventually Mary was going to leave him.
You're not still afraid, are you?
I thought you were crying.
The value of health cannot be overestimated.
You'll suffer because of that.
I don't think Tom knows exactly how much it'll cost.
Tom said he's healthy.
I know Tom's nice.
Tom already knows Mary is planning to do that.
Don't take off your gloves.
Keep it up!
Tom said he wasn't going to do that again.
Tom should have been able to show you how to do that.
Tom said he and Mary left early because Mary felt sick.
Tom said he didn't think Mary should have done that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unfriendly.
Put your pants on.
They said they weren't ready to talk.
I know Tom's not the one who's supposed to do that.
I admit I despised Tom since the first time I met him.
Are there a lot of Africans in Germany?
Where did you put the television guide?
Tom said Mary wasn't pretty.
It is true that the earth is round.
Tom couldn't help smiling.
Tom doesn't like people to know that he can't speak well French.
Check out that girl.
Tom told Mary that she should quit pretending to be disabled.
I told Tom you were coming to Australia.
Tom thinks that's a mistake.
I knew Tom was a reasonable guy.
Tom thought Mary was downstairs.
I didn't want to admit I couldn't do that.
Tom said he was ready to do whatever was necessary.
Tom said he owes Mary a lot of money.
Tom said he thought I was creative.
I'm sorry, but I can't eat dinner with you.
It's not safe to go out after dark by yourself.
Did you know Tom had a son?
Tom knows Mary likes Boston.
Tom and Mary said they're not likely to win.
Tom told me he would have been forgiven.
Tom said he thought Mary would do that tomorrow.
Tom knows there's only one course of action possible.
Tom and Mary said they tried very hard to win.
They say they lost their keys.
I've decided never to do that again.
I didn't know you were dating Tom.
I think Tom hasn't made a decision yet.
I know you still want to do that.
Please tell Tom and Mary that they are not required to do that.
Good job, guys!
I know Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do that today.
Tom and Mary say they didn't want to do that.
Tom hopes he doesn't have to live in Australia for more than a year.
Don't you know everyone's talking about us?
Tom said Mary knew he didn't want to do that until next Monday.
I know Tom's house is for sale.
I don't think Tom is sad.
I don't think Tom will really win.
I would have wanted to do that with you.
I'm not interested in sex.
Tom told everyone he was determined to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was strict.
Tom said he thought Mary might have to do that by herself.
We wish we could have done more to help.
Tom said he thought it would snow tonight.
I promised Tom I'd be home early.
Tom said he would look at it.
Tom said doing that was more difficult than he thought it would be.
You would have loved the movie.
They told me they don't really care what happens.
Tom's speech wasn't as long as Mary's.
I didn't know that Tom would be willing to show me how to do that.
I'm sorry I bothered you.
Everyone seems to be afraid but you.
Tom was afraid his parents would start asking him questions and that he would finally tell them everything.
Was the book you were reading yesterday in French?
I'm a damage sufferer.
Tom didn't know I was from Australia.
You could have gone.
Tom said he didn't think the smell bothered Mary.
He thinks I'm in love with her.
I thought you were a better chess player than this.
I'm glad to see that Tom is happy again.
I thought Tom had already left.
I knew Tom wouldn't be able to keep Mary from doing that.
I don't think we have a lot of time.
Tom said he's trying to hide Mary.
I don't think Tom would have done that for me.
Tom is the funnyest person I've ever met.
I doubt Tom really plans to do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might not have to do that this week.
I know Tom knows he didn't need to do that.
To tell the truth, I am not your father.
I don't think Tom will do that with Mary.
That's the real reason Tom ran away from home, isn't it?
I thought you could walk Mary home.
Tom said he hopes Mary is trying to do that.
You like chocolate, right?
I don't think Tom really had to do that this morning.
Tom says he knows Mary can't speak very well French.
Tom hasn't told me where he's planning to stay in Boston.
Tom didn't have to come here.
They said they enjoyed the challenge.

Does Tom really think Mary enjoys doing that?
I haven't eaten anything for the last three days.

We haven't been told yet.

Last night I picked up.
Everyone here except me has done that.

You weren't surprised that I didn't have to do that, were you?
I am familiar with this subject.

Tom knew Mary was with John.

I should have paid in advance.
We're going to go to the airport.
I doubted that Tom would be able to talk Mary into doing that.
It's not Tom's idea, it's mine.
I didn't think anyone else had noticed.
That cat is so cute!
I'm pretty sure Tom didn't know I wasn't going to do that.
I know Tom is a mechanic.
A jack of all trades is a master of none.
I wonder if Tom is satisfied.
I know you still want to be with me.
Tom told me he was unemployed.
I didn't know you could understand French.
I doubt you will be happy with my report.
I should have known that Tom would do that.
Tom told me he used to live in Australia.
I'm glad you succeeded.
It'll take no less than one hour to go there.
I knew Tom wouldn't pass the exam.
You may use my desk if you want.
I think Tom would agree with me.
Don't stay too long!
I know Tom is popular.
It makes sense.
Tom said he really did that without anybody's help.
I wonder if Tom is prepared to do that.
I don't think Tom would care if you did that today.
I know that Tom used to be a speech coach.
He cannot swimming a mile.
Tom said he's probably not going to do that.
Tom said Mary was upset.
I don't think Tom's a good lawyer.
Tom's gonna have to figure it out.
Are you absolutely sure Tom has to do that?
They said they hope it will happen soon.
Tom said he's not being used.
I thought I had nothing to lose.
By daybreak the storm was over.
No one I know really wants to do that.
I think Tom's expecting someone to make dinner for him.
They said they don't want to do that.
The price of gasoline is so high that we cannot buy a big car.
Why didn't you tell me you knew how to do that already?
Tom told me he hoped Mary would be discreet.
"Thanks." "What for?" "For everything."
You're a teacher.
Many men, many minds.
Anything is possible.
Tom and Mary told me they were displeased.
Tom and Mary say they need to do that.
Let's hope that never happens again.
I don't think that actually happened.
Tom said Mary has been arrested before.
Tom said Mary's not ready.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
Tom had trouble admitting he was wrong.
I thought you might want to play a game of check.
Tom said he thought Mary would be impressed.
I know it's very unlikely anyone knows me.
Tom said he wasn't sure he could do it.
Are you going to be okay?
They told me they were famed.
I thought something was seriously wrong with Tom.
Tom said he's not sleepy yet.
Tom assumed that everyone knew that Mary was going to do that.
I know that Tom probably shouldn't do that anymore.
I had no idea Tom could do that.
It looks like Tom's waiting for someone.
Tom said he thought Mary was probably having a good time in Boston.
You broke the computer.
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
They say they like studying French.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's favorite flower is.
I knew Tom was ready to do that.
I suspect Tom will probably do that.
Tom said he was going to stay up all night.
I didn't know that Tom was a veteran.
I thought this was what you wanted me to buy.
My daughter often experienced asthma attacks as a child.
I knew Tom didn't know you were the one who had done that.
We've already met everyone.
Tom said there were still a lot of things left to do.
You don't have a chance.
If Tom had had enough money, he would have gone to Boston with Mary.
Tom told everyone that he was glad that that would happen.
You always doubt my word.
I didn't know I couldn't do what Tom asked me to do.
There's a good chance we'll win.
Tom says he knows Mary can win.
I know Tom's not a baseball fan.
I knew Tom would ask Mary to do that.
I think Tom shouldn't agree to do that.
I don't think Tom sold anything all day.
I think I'm too old for her.
I don't think I should have left early.
I didn't say I was going to Australia.
Tom should've stayed in Boston for a few more days.
I should have told Tom earlier.
Tom and Mary said they didn't like to do that.
Tom'll remember.
It's not something I think I can do.
Tom told me where he was planning to stay.
I know you're not planning to stay in Australia.
I know Tom was impolite.
Do you have a pencil I can lend?
Tom also wanted to do that.
I could have done that for you.
I think Tom's home.
It is painful for America to lose our young men and women.
Tom should do everything they tell him.
Everyone but Tom knew he didn't have to go to Australia.
What is the most beautiful place in the world?
The storm caused much damage to the crop.
I don't think everyone gave up.
Let's get our photo taken.
I knew it wouldn't be easy.
Suddenly all the lights went out.
Tom and Mary said they'll probably win.
I think Tom would be annoyed if you did that.
Tom and Mary thought they'd find other jobs.
Tom said I shouldn't leave early.
I know I should stay and help.
Don't look at me.
I suspect Tom and Mary were planning to do that tomorrow.
I didn't know you knew how to drive a bus.
I'm not sure I want to do this.
I know Tom's doing that well.
Tom said nothing had changed.
That's not one of my priorities.
It's not something I can decide quickly.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it to your party last night.
I know Tom knows I needed to do that.
Stay out of this.
I know that Tom is afraid he'll be fired.
If I were you, I would call the doctor.
I didn't feel very hungry.
I've done everything you asked me to do.
Do you have a bond I could lend?
I didn't think we would find anyone who could do that for us.
Tom isn't an angel.
I think Tom's mad.
That sounds amazing.
Tom's driving to Mary's apartment to give her something.
Tom said he thought Mary would wait.
Tom said he didn't think that the smell bothered Mary.
Tom said he's willing to do that for us.
Can you believe Tom is still only thirteen?
Tom sent Mary his picture.
Tom already knows that Mary doesn't plan to be here today.
They say they've never eaten Thai food.
I think Tom and Mary have never been to Boston.
They're playing chess.
I thought I heard someone singing.
I heard Tom plans to move to Australia.
It's not as hot here as I expected.
They don't think they'll do that.
I don't think I'm here.
No one saw Tom leave.
I knew Tom used to live in Boston.
Tom ran back home to get something he forgot.
Tom told me he could win.
Tom had no problems with Mary.
I thought Tom refused to do that.
How do you know that you don't mistake me for someone else?
You should have refused to stay in Boston.
No one can save you.
I'm glad I didn't.
I'm beginning to believe we'll never convince Tom that he's wrong.
Tom said he didn't want to live in Boston anymore.
Tom should never have been let out of prison.
His train arrives at the main station at 5.50 p.m.
They said they couldn't wait.
Tom said Mary thought that John might be required to do that by himself.
I know what I would do.
He doesn't need to bring the umbrella.
Both Tom and Mary weren't at home when we went to visit them.
Tom thinks I need to do that today.
Tom admitted he didn't do what we asked him to do.
It's a pity that we didn't visit Tom when we had the opportunity.
Tom told me you were with him last afternoon.
Tom and I didn't know that we were those who were supposed to do that.
I'm so tired that I can hardly walk.
They felt that they needed to do something.
I read many foreign languages, but speak no one.
You set up a trap.
I should have added more salt.
I know that's not what you want.
I didn't know Tom and Mary used to be married.
I think Tom's been smashed.
Tom and Mary say they'll never do that.
I think Tom's sorry.
You were skinny the first time I met you.
I think Tom could have been home by himself.
Both Tom and Mary know who you are.
Mary said she doesn't plan to do that by herself.
It's not supposed to be fun.
They said they were unimpressed.
Tom hasn't told us yet what he needs to do.
I know you probably didn't need to do that.
I wonder if Tom still remembers where we met first.
If only you had helped me yesterday, the problem would have been avoided.
Tom said he expected Mary to get back to Boston on October 20th.
Tom said he thought he might be required to do that again.
Tom thinks you want me to pay the bill.
Tom and Mary said they didn't swim.
I knew Tom told Mary he couldn't do that.
Tom said he had to leave early.
They realize that they're ignored.
If Tom had left at 2:30, he would have been here right now.
Tom and Mary said they would do it.
There's no doubt Tom used to live in Australia.
Tom has decided to stay in Australia for another three days.
Tom said he thought I seemed unconcerned.
I should have stayed and helped Tom.
Tom said he thought I could do that.
I figured Tom would panic.
Tom thinks he's the best swimming here.
I wonder if it'll snow tomorrow.
I wonder if Tom is pleased.
I'm freezing fish.
The wind calmed down in the evening.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Slow down.
Tom would have done that by now if he was really planning to do it.
I know that Tom could do that if he really needed to.
We'll never know.
Tom admitted that he had killed Mary.
Didn't you know your taillights weren't working?
They think they're in love.
Tom and Mary think they can do that.
Tom's never gonna hurt anyone again.
I'm learning Esperanto very quickly.
You're not going to get in trouble for helping me, are you?
I've heard that women spend more on shoes than men.
I think Tom will be excited.
We'll land in 15 minutes.
Tom said he would take care of Mary.
Tom's parents let him do anything he wants to do.
I thought you were going to fix that.
I hope I never have to do that.
Tom has already been told he's not going to be allowed to do that.
They say they're unsure.
I know Tom didn't know he wouldn't be able to do that.
Tom should have told me earlier.
I have to go to the toilet.
Both men apologized to each other.
You're not doing anything wrong, are you?
Tom said Mary doesn't think John will actually do that.
They say they also need to do that.
I know that Tom knows why Mary had to do that.
They told me they would help me.
I don't think I'll ever be able to afford to buy a house.
Don't you think we have a chance to win?
They said they wouldn't speak French.
Tom thought Mary didn't like computer games.
Tom and Mary say they don't think they're snarping.
I knew Tom was active in his church.
Everyone knew Tom could speak French well.
Tom said he found something.
A business is not a charity.
Tom said he didn't think Mary had ever been to Australia.
I don't think Tom is as good-looking as John is.
Tom said he thought that prices at that store were too high.
I don't think anyone disputes that.
Tom and Mary said they couldn't remember.
Tom said he hoped he could do that today.
You knew everyone at the party, didn't you?
Tom said Mary was unafraid.
I'm sorry it happened like this.
I know Tom's not afraid to walk through the woods alone.
Both Tom and I are angry.
I don't think Tom will be able to do that without some help.
It's hot.
Tom told me he didn't want to live in Boston.
No one asked me if I liked it or not.
Many old people can't keep up with the times these days.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be blamed for the problem.
I know that Tom appreciated that.
Tom told me he decided to do that.
It's a kind of cat.
Tom thought Mary would probably refuse to do that.
I'm sure you'll succeed.
Tom refused that he had accepted the bribe.
Tom said he thought that doing that wouldn't be a good idea.
I admit I didn't do what Tom said I had to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was broken.
Tom told me he thought Mary was miserable.
Can't this wait until morning?
We'll land in 15 minutes.
We know that won't happen anymore.
They said they were really sorry.
Tom cleared his throat loudly.
I think Tom is unpredicted.
I'm afraid I've lost it.
Tom said Mary was likely to be grumpy.
We're both adults.
They're not as weak as they used to be.
I know Tom was supposed to do that.
Tom said he thought I should do that today.
Don't talk about business while we eat.
I don't think I need to help Tom do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was tough.
I hope Tom gets adopted by a good family.
Tom said he thought you knew Mary.
She's got to be taken to the hospital.
I would have helped you if you had asked.
Okay.
Tom said he thought I was wearing a wig.
This is not a drill.
Tom should've done that a long time ago.
I think Tom slept all afternoon.
I wonder if Tom's upset.
Tom said he knew they couldn't let him do that at school.
Tom said he hopes Mary likes to do that.
Tom would have done that for Mary if he had more time.
I don't think you really need to do that.
Something's still not right.
Are you crazy?
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I know Tom's not planning going to Boston with you.
Tom said he's not sure Mary has to do that.
I didn't think Tom would be able to talk to Mary about doing that.
Is it true that Tom and Mary plan to stay in Boston until October?
I didn't know you didn't want to do that by yourself.
Tom said he thought that doing that would be fun.
I think you'll discover that it was Tom's fault.
I thought it was rather ingenious.
Do you know if Tom and Mary are going to do that?
What makes you think Tom and Mary were the ones who did that?
Do you still plan to do that with Tom?
Tom said he didn't feel safe.
His younger sister is a famous TV star.
I know what time you said you would be there, but I couldn't be there at that time.
I don't think they're complaining.
You and I both know that's not true.
Let's assume that'll happen.
Tom told everyone he didn't know what to do.
Tom needed someone he could trust.
I want to hear a story.
Tom told me that he thought Mary was truthful.
It's quite likely Tom will come.
I doubt Tom will come to Boston this year.
I didn't think anyone had tried that before.
You should have made better use of your time.
They say they're not planning on going.
Tom said it looked like Mary had a really hard time doing that.
I'm learning Old English.
I want the rest of the money you owe me.
Tom said Mary could have done that alone.
I hope more people will be here.
Tom told me he thought Mary was hard to get along with.
They said they were very drunk.
You could've told me earlier.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceived.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are skeptical.
I know that Tom never does that anymore.
Tom says he swears only when it's absolutely necessary.
I don't think Tom's high.
Tom was drunk and said things he shouldn't have said.
Tom said he thought Mary was interested in basketball.
Tom told me he thought this book was interesting.
Tom assumed everyone knew he couldn't do that.
Tom said he planned to go on October 20th.
They said they're just fine.
Hostilities resumed between the two powers.
The only reason Tom came to Australia was because everyone else in his family did.
I would have done that if I could have.
I thought Mary said she wasn't planning to do that.
Tom assumed that everyone at school knew he was arrested.
Tom wished that he knew how to make Mary happy.
Tom said he saw Mary do that.
Tom and Mary said they needed the money.
Tom said he thought Mary was going to be able to do that.
I think Tom's the one who's supposed to tell Mary to do that.
Everyone knows Tom can't speak French very well.
My findings suggest that is not the case.
Tom found the watch he had lost.
I don't know anything about Boston.
Tom said he thought it might be dangerous to do that.
Someone must have left the window open.
I know Tom is a mad person.
I'm sorry, sir.
I know Tom knew Mary was planning to do that.
Tom was just stating the obvious.
Tom said he wasn't offered a job.
Tom didn't know Mary wasn't happy.
Tom said he would be able to do that in a few hours.
No one doubts that you will be able to pass the exam.
Where's everyone?
How did you feel?
Fortune favors the brave.
They're not sure they can do that again.
I thought Tom was doing that.
I wonder if Tom and Mary are still staring at me.
I thought Tom had heard us.
It's not compulsory.
I hope no one's coming.
What color was Tom wearing?
Tom and Mary wouldn't ask you to do that for them if they could find anyone else to do it for them.
Tom said he'd walk Mary home.
It'll be hard for Tom to win.
We should have hired someone more qualified.
Tom told me he thought Mary was unimpressed.
I wonder if Tom knows he's overweight.
Tom said he didn't know why Mary went to Australia.
Tom told me he was too tired to study.
Where's your luggage?
Both my parents are musicians.
I live in Groningen.
How do we know that's not true?
Tom said he didn't want to die.
That's the car I want to buy.
Tom said he thought Mary would be able to help him do that tomorrow.
I know Tom's chubby.
Will it be a dry day tomorrow?
I'm not sure Tom's going to be willing to talk to me.
Tom said he's glad Mary was able to win.
I didn't think you could get Tom to do that.
It's not raining.
I can't speak English, much less German.
Tom thought something bad would happen.
I thought that's what you would have wanted.
I know it's very unlikely anyone knows me.
Where's Tom now?
Tom said Mary went to a divorce lawyer.
They said they knew they could win.
I doubt Tom will be reasonable.
Tom and I both enjoy playing volleyball.
It's not likely Tom will ever admit he's wrong.
Tom said he was unable to win.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that.
Tom said he couldn't do that anytime soon.
There's a possibility Tom won't want to go to Boston with us.
It's not enough to know only one language.
She's a blonde girl.
Tom thinks we can't do that.
I know Tom is a better tennis player than I am.
Tom said he's not mad.
Tom may have done the same thing Mary did.
I know Tom is a sophomore.
Tom definitely knew he shouldn't have eaten that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was interested.
I thought you were planning to be here early.
Tom said Mary knew John might not have to do that until Monday.
Tom shouldn't have ever tried to do that by himself.
How's your father?
My son is not a snob.
I would've let Tom do it.
Tom and Mary said it was more difficult than they expected.
I don't think they're bad people.
They said they didn't want me to wait.
No one suspected it.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary wants to do that alone.
I wonder if it's really hot tomorrow.
Is this the first time you've experienced this kind of pain?
Tom said Mary knew she might not have to do that again.
They swore they wouldn't do that again.
I don't really plan to do that.
I know that Tom will allow you to do that.
Tom said Mary would do that.
They said they won't do that.
Tom thinks Mary won't do that for John.
Tom said he thought there was a good chance that Mary would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would like it.
You're not the only one Tom asked.
Tom thought Mary wasn't finished doing that yet.
They put their notebooks away.
Tom and Mary said they felt uncomfortable.
I didn't know that Tom could actually do that.
I didn't say I used to live in Australia.
Tom said he knew why Mary wanted to do that.
Tom said he wanted to buy something for Mary.
I know Tom can't come to Boston, but I wish he would.
Tom said he thought Mary was about thirty.
We went up by two floors to reach the apparel stables.
I don't think Tom is funny.
Tom thinks he's gonna die soon.
I thought Tom was sick.
I know Tom didn't know why Mary was afraid to do that.
They said they would be happy to help.
Tom and I both want to go.
I didn't know you would tell me.
Tom and Mary said they were jealous.
I thought I could do that for Tom.
Tom promised he would never make such a mistake again.
Don't you think we should have talked to Tom about this?
Tom told me he thought Mary was fat.
Tom told me that he thought Mary still wanted to go to Australia.
Don't sweat the small stuff.
I don't think anyone can help me now.
Tom said it's a very common problem.
Are you sure this will work?
I'm afraid I'll be tied up all afternoon.
I know you can hear me.
You seemed to be unwilling to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought she was doing it wrong, but she didn't care what he thought.
The doctor is not available now.
Football players make a lot of money.
Tom's a first-time offender.
I promise you that won't happen.
Tom said that Mary thought he might have to do that.
Tom said he wouldn't ever try to do that again.
I don't think it ever worked.
Don't forget to take your medicine.
You don't know how hard it was for Tom.
Tom has given me a lot of things.
I know Tom is a few years older than Mary.
I wonder if Tom likes to do that.
I know that Tom can't do that without some help.
Tom admitted he lied to me.
Tom and Mary have told John they don't plan to stay at home all day.
Tom doesn't know I still have this.
We're not quite sure what we're supposed to do.
We both love Tom.
Tom said he hopes you try your best to do that.
I was surprised that Tom didn't want to do what anyone else wanted to do.
Tom said Mary knew she might be allowed to do that tonight.
I don't think I know the man who's playing the drums.
This old man has liver spots on his skin.
Tom and Mary vowed they would never do that.
Give me that candle.
Tom didn't seem to be aware of what he needed to do.
There's no time to explain.
Tom didn't realize he had to leave.
They said they were afraid.
Tom and Mary say they can't find their hats.
I graduated from Kyoto University.
You're comparing apples and oranges!
Tom said there was still a lot of work to do.
Tom told me he thought Mary was embarrassing.
Tom said he thought he was arrested.
Tom and Mary told me they were worn out.
I've heard that the most beautiful women in the world live in Australia.
Tom said he didn't want to see Mary anymore.
They're living in a fantasy world.
They said they thought I was charming.
I didn't know that Tom was in the hospital.
I don't think you'll have a lot of fun doing that.
I suspect Tom doesn't do that as often as he used to.
I was surprised that Tom didn't know how to do that.
I'm planning to skip lunch.
I knew Tom would show you how to do that if you asked him to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was afraid.
Tom has already told me that he's decided to go Boston next summer.
That doesn't make sense.
They say they're dying.
Tom offered to borrow me some money.
Do you think Tom would let me do that?
Tom had no idea that Mary didn't know what she was doing.
Tom told everyone he needed to do that.
I don't think Tom is a native French speaker.
They said they weren't planning to go.
They say they've taught French.
I suspect Tom and Mary are curious.
I know Tom knows I don't need to do that.
You have to help Tom.
Tom told us he had a headache.
The bomb was defused just minutes before it would have exploded.
Tom and Mary told me they would win, but they didn't.
I'm glad to hear it!
Tom and Mary say they don't know any French.
I don't think we'll find anyone who can help us do that.
You should have refused to go to Boston.
I thought you didn't approve of Tom dating Mary.
Tom said that's not the main reason why Mary should do that.
Tom doesn't have a car and Mary does not.
I'm a cat.
I know you don't do that anymore.
Tom said he wasn't different.
Tom admitted what he said was wrong.
Tom could have been afraid.
Who do you think you asked me to give this to you?
I've just been sick.
I hope I get a raise.
Tom said he didn't think we should even consider doing that.
Tom said he would have come if we invited him.
I don't think I'll probably do that.
Tom said he might cry.
It's Sunday.
Tom told me he wasn't tired.
I didn't think anyone really thought Tom was busy.
I think you know we have to do that today.
I didn't think Tom would actually do that.
I knew Tom would leave early.
Tom said he thought Mary understood French.
Tom said he needed my help, so I helped him.
I don't think anyone's lived in this house in a long time.
Tom refused to steal the money.
Tom said he hasn't yet decided what he's gonna do.
Everyone knew that Tom didn't like going to Boston.
Tom said he thought tomorrow would be a sunny day.
Tom is obviously drunk.
I'm absolutely sure that's not going to happen.
Everyone was there except Tom.
I thought you had promised to give that to Tom.
I thought you said you saw Tom this morning.
I think Tom was supposed to be here.
Tom and Mary said they had completely recovered.
I didn't know that you didn't plan to do that by yourself.
I don't think there's any way out of here.
There is no rose without a thorn.
Tom thought Mary probably didn't know that John spoke French.
You know I wouldn't do that.
I think we all know that's a bad idea.
I thought Tom knew what Mary had to do.
Tom was probably about thirteen years old at the time.
Tom and Mary said they were ticclish.
Tom said he wouldn't be able to help weeping the garden today.
I wonder how Tom knew I would be here.
Tom said he thought he was the only one who wanted to do that.
I'm not sure Tom would let me do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was mean.
So, where is the problem?
Tom didn't think Mary was beautiful.
He will have to do that task again.
I know Tom didn't know anyone who could do that.
Only fresh vegetation is sold here.
I think this isn't a good idea.
Tom has already been asked not to do that.
Here's your change.
That portrait reminds me of someone I knew a long time ago.
When was the last time you asked someone for help?
I'm sure Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Tom told me he thought Mary was skinny.
I know Tom's irritated.
I didn't meet anyone new today.
This lake is the deepest in Japan.
I knew Tom was planning to do that.
Tom and I both don't speak French.
I thought you were ready.
I know that Tom knew why Mary didn't like to do that.
I didn't think Tom was glad that that had happened.
They said they were very tired.
You're not old enough to get a driver's license, are you?
I don't think there's any harm to tell you now.
I thought you said you did that on Monday.
Everyone here knows Tom is in Boston.
Tom refused Mary last week.
That's not why I'm here.
Austria is a parliamentary republic in the middle of Europe and consists of nine federal states.
Tom and Mary are looking for someone to help them build a wall.
They said they're not yet thirty.
I didn't think Tom really needed to do that yesterday.
I thought Tom was already back.
Tom said Mary knew she might not be allowed to do that unless John does it with her.
Tom and Mary told everyone they were pleased.
Tom said Mary thought John might be required to do that.
Tom told me that he thought Mary wouldn't want to do that.
I thought Mary was cute.
Tom thinks Mary won't be able to do that by itself.
Tom said he thought Mary was happy.
Did Tom say he stayed in Australia?
Tom said he'd pay for everything.
They told me they weren't alone.
I don't think I can finish the job alone.
Tom said Mary's not safe.
Tom said I looked thinner than the last time he saw me.
They said they would see me tomorrow.
Tom said Mary was concerned.
I'm afraid Tom won't let me go.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's going to do this afternoon.
Tom paid someone to do that.
I thought Tom would be cooperative.
Tom told me he was safe.
Tom said I should go to Boston with you.
They think they know what to do.
Tom thinks Mary will be scared.
Tom and I are both very proud of you.
I knew Tom would show Mary how to do that if she asked him to.
We can't pretend to Tom is normal.
Tom's amused.
Tom should never have tried to do that alone.
Tom and Mary said they'd never do that.
I'm more than him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conservative.
Tom said he thought Mary probably wouldn't want to do that on a cold day like today.
The teachers' room and the gym are under renovation.
Do you think there's any chance you'll be able to do that?
Tom put down his glass.
You'd think that would have impressed Tom.
This is the first time I bought a newspaper in this city.
That's a good question.
Without water, we cannot exist.
Tom certainly understands that we all need to attend today's meeting.
Tom and Mary say they didn't agree to do that.
I know Tom will be able to help us do that.
I had lunch three hours ago.
Tom said he appreciated Mary's help.
I knew Tom would forgive me.
You're the only one who can protect them.
Can anyone explain this to me?
Did you know Tom was going to be in Boston every week?
Tom and Mary told me they wanted a dog.
Everyone knows that Tom and Mary like each other.
I know Tom didn't know that I wasn't going to do that.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom has a lot of things he needs to do.
Tom and Mary say they're not sure they're ready.
There is no logical reason for this.
I suspect Tom was inxicated.
I hope I gave you enough money to buy everything you needed.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary enjoyed doing that.
They said they were feeling fine.
I wish you hadn't seen me do that.
Tom and Mary said they had no money.
I don't think I need to tell Tom to do that.
Tom should've never got that job.
Tom told Mary that she was his one and only.
Tom knew he wouldn't be expelled.
Tom was convinced that Mary didn't want to do that.
Tom said he knew that was what Mary had to do.
I think you're great.
I wonder if Tom's going to Boston next week.
Tom says he didn't know that Mary wouldn't go to Australia unless he went with her.
I know Tom doesn't want to do that.
You're not an idiot.
I think Tom doesn't win very often when he plays chess.
Tom said he didn't know Mary was unable to speak French very well.
Tom said he knew Mary would win the race.
I know Tom came to Australia last week.
Tom said Mary wasn't mad.
I think we bought everything we need.
Tom said he thought he might not have to do that by himself.
Tom's hiding something, and Mary knows it.
I think Tom's average.
You're not just working for Tom.
Tom said he knew that Mary might be required to do that by herself.
I don't think Tom knows how it happened.
It's not a watch.
Tom and Mary said they're unafraid.
I'm from the United States.
I don't think Tom knows how to have a good time.
I know you don't want to hurt me.
Tom seems to be unwilling to correct his mistakes.
I loved that book!
Tom said Mary wouldn't like to do that.
Tom said he felt safe.
Tom's homesick.
Did you know that would happen?
I think Tom believed me.
I don't think we can do that by 2:30.
Tom thinks Mary would probably not do that.
I thought you said we weren't going to do that anymore.
I know Tom doesn't know anyone who can do that.
I'm pretty sure Tom has a girlfriend.
I thought you might be the only person who would listen to me.
I know Tom didn't know Mary didn't do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be nervous doing that.
That's the guitar I want to buy.
I think Tom did it.
See you tomorrow morning!
They told me they were ambidextrous.
I know Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't have to do that.
I really thought Tom would change his mind.
Tom would have missed the train if he had stopped buying a chocolate bar.
I doubt very seriously that Tom will be excited about that.
I didn't know I was supposed to help Tom do that.
No matter what you say, I'm convinced that I'm right.
Tom said he didn't need any more help.
We cannot make a change in our schedule.
I was shocked when I heard that Tom had been arrested.
Tom and Mary probably don't know they're not supposed to park there.
I thought you could use a friend.
You're not really gonna kill Tom, are you?
They said they'd be willing to help us.
Tom told me he'd do that.
Tom is not the same as he was thirty years ago.
I don't think there's any point in discussing this today.
I suspect Tom won't tell Mary she needs to do that today.
America's Civil War lasted four years.
They say they're disappointed.
It is not always easy to distinguish good from evil.
Tom said he's going to try something he's never done before.
I don't think Tom is strong.
It's not too hard.
Tom said you didn't want to go to Boston with us.
I suspect Tom and Mary are suspicious.
You're a prude.
Tom said he would have done that if he could have.
I don't think anyone really wants to do that.
Tom said he wished he would kisse Mary good night.
If you do, I will.
I think Tom is unplaceable.
They told me they're trying to do that.
I don't think I have everything I need.
That's not what Tom wanted you to do.
What book did you give to Tom?
I didn't know Tom was in Boston last year.
Tom and Mary say they're hoping they can do that.
I know that Tom expected me to do that.
I wonder if Tom has ever been to Boston.
It's not quite finished.
Tom said he felt frustrated.
I know Tom will do that with Mary.
I sent Mary some roses.
Tom said Mary was more than her sister.
I wasn't as hungry as Tom.
Will you borrow me your dictionary?
I buy things that I know I'm not going to use.
Tom claims he didn't kill anyone.
Tom and Mary said they were very grateful.
How are you doing today?
Tom said Mary wanted to do that yesterday.
Tom told me he's not going to do that.
I know Tom is a lot stronger than I am.
It was not a easy decision.
I wonder if I can still do that.
I knew Tom didn't want me to do that.
Tom didn't tell anyone anything.
It's Tom's thirtyth birthday tomorrow.
Tom said he didn't think Mary really did what John said she did.
Tom and Mary said they were Canadian.
They hoped they could win.
Tom said he was glad that Mary could do that.
I should have told you everything earlier.
I thought you had another reason.
I think you shouldn't have bought that car.
Tom told Mary that he was unwilling to do that.
I should have known Tom would be busy.
Tom told me he thought Mary was thirty.
Tom said he heard someone crying.
Tom told me he thought Mary had to do that.
Tom thought I didn't have to do that.
Nobody asked for your help.
I thought Tom did that yesterday.
Tom was not allowed to board the plane because he did not hold a valid travel document.
Something's wrong.
Tom believes Mary's trying to discredit him.
Tom didn't seem too angry.
Tom said he thought Mary wasn't by doing that yet.
I think Tom won't be early.
Tom told me Mary was nervous.
Samurai lived by a code of honor.
I know Tom doesn't know when I did that.
Tom said Mary has been here before.
I can't believe Tom actually did that.
I don't think I bought everything I need.
Tom said he didn't have anything to do.
I should have noticed it before.
I thought Tom was going to ask Mary not to do that.
I wonder if Tom wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought we might have a problem.
It rained straight for three days.
Tom thought Mary was pregnant.
When was Tom the first time that?
Do you know if Tom and Mary are allowed to do that?
We told everyone we were moving to Australia.
Please do that tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.
I don't think Tom's married anymore.
Tom said he thought Mary would be alone.
Everyone knows Tom and I don't like each other.
I'll see you tomorrow.
They say they were hungry.
Tom said he should have done that.
Tom was cremated.
Tom said he thought Mary had already finished doing that.
Tom told me he thought he might be able to do that.
I suspect Tom's still in love with his ex-wife.
I know Tom knew that Mary was the one who had to do that.
Tom is very rarely waiting for anyone.
I just assumed that everyone was going to do that.
I don't think you understand what this means.
It's not possible.
I don't think you have the guts.
I've been busy since yesterday.
Tom said I shouldn't have tried that by myself.
Tom said he wished he hadn't tried to do that.
Tom was the one who told me I needed to do that.
I didn't think we could get home by 2:30.
Tom said he couldn't sleep last night.
Tom told me he thought Mary was creative.
Tom could have come yesterday, but he didn't.
I didn't know that Tom didn't want to do that alone.
Tom thinks he's better than anyone else.
I wonder if Tom was able to do that by himself.
Maybe it would have been better if I hadn't done it.
I suspect Tom will probably have to do that.
You know I'm not good with secrets.
I'm not as busy now as I was this time last year.
I would have talked to Tom instead of just ignoring him.
I thought you wanted to meet my family.
I don't think Tom will be disobedient.
Tom said he was going to do that every day after he retired.
There's not much I can do to help, I'm afraid.
Both Tom and Mary are still not married.
I know Tom knew Mary couldn't do that.
We're at school together.
I would like you to look over these documents.
Tom's tired.
Tom said he didn't need a lawyer.
Tom and Mary said they were going by train.
I didn't know that Tom didn't really want to do that by himself.

I know Tom's grouchy.
Tom has passed out.
Doing that would be hard.

I thought Tom lived in Australia.
I'm very surprised Tom didn't want to do that.
Tom doesn't think you're going to be able to do that.
Tom said he thought he was arrested.
I don't think Tom's available.
I don't think Tom's doing that.
I wonder if Tom's interested.

Tom thought he might not be required to do that by himself.
I know Tom doesn't know that Mary has never done that before.
Tom gave me all the money I asked for.
Tom said Mary knew John might want to do that by himself.
The wood has become saturated with water.
I don't think Tom understood.

I don't think it's a problem anymore.
Tom told me he thinks he'll do that tomorrow.
I thought it would clear up in the afternoon.

I know that doesn't matter.
Tom says Mary is trustworthy.
Tom and Mary told me they enjoyed the picnic.
I know I shouldn't have done that, but I did it anyway.
I think Tom is the one who painted this fence.
Tom must've thought Mary could speak French.
He's a very affectionate father.
How did Tom know Mary would do that?
Tom told me he was in a lot of trouble.
Tom thinks it'll rain tomorrow.
I didn't know that Tom owned a gun.
I thought there was a good chance that Tom would want to do that.
I didn't think Tom would want your old bike.
I wonder if Tom knows who left this package on my desk.
Tom should have been found guilty.
It's not working yet.
Tom told me he thought Mary would be mad.
You're not really planning to help Tom, are you?
Tom, it's not necessary to apologize.
I'm already late.
Tom knows he has a problem.
I became a doctor so I could help people.
You can't buy happiness.
You promised you'd do that.
Tom said he thought Mary would be absent.
It's not going to be as hard to do as you think it's going to be.
Tom doesn't know Mary doesn't like him.
Are you over 18?
Tom won't leave his children here with us.
Tom didn't realize we wanted to do that.
Tom said he thought you were likely to do that.
Tom said that Mary thought that he might be required to do that the next time he travels.
Tom said he did that for Mary.
Tom said he doesn't think it's necessary to do that.
Tom said Mary isn't sure if John wants to do that or not.
I thought things would get better.
I hope Tom and Mary aren't faster doing that than I do.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
Tom said he thought Mary was unlikely to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was conceived.
The way you're planning to do that is dangerous.
You should have come sooner.
I think Tom is strong.
Tom and Mary didn't know they were supposed to be here yesterday.
I really doubt Tom will be there.
Tom said he's really glad he moved to Australia.
I know Tom is a forest ranger.
It'll be hard for Tom to do that.
They said they'd only talk to you.
French is her mother tongue.
I don't think Tom should do that alone.
Tom picked up his bag and left.
I'm not the only one here who's not married.
Tom said he knew he might not have to do that again.
They know they should do that today.
You should have been a lawyer.
I'm pretty sure Tom doesn't know I'm here.
I don't think I need to wear a bond to the party.
I don't think there's any reason Tom has to do that.
Tom said Mary was probably still to be pessimistic.
I don't think I could do that even if I tried.
I know that Tom hasn't yet asked Mary to do that.
Tom told me he thought Mary was talented.
I don't think that doing that is a very good idea.
I'm afraid Tom may not do what he's supposed to do.
Tom said Mary didn't want to go to the concert.
Tom told me he'd drive Mary to the airport.
Tom said he's driving to Boston on Monday.
They told me they're sleepy.
I know you and Tom will do that together.
I think this is the first time Tom did that.
Tom hoped he wouldn't be punished.
I know Tom is a very rich man.
Tom must have been home at that time.
I don't think I'm going to like being here.
There's no hope.
Tom could have gone camping with you if you let him know you were going.
I don't think Tom knows why Mary kept doing that even though he wouldn't ask her to.
Tom told me he thought Mary was still interested in doing that.
Are you good at reading maps?
Tom says Mary lies a lot.
I doubt Tom will ever do that.
I think Tom is probably a pretty good lawyer.
I thought I could do that without any help.
You're pulling my leg.
I thought you said you'd never try to do that by yourself.
I don't think we'll do that by ourselves.
I know Tom will be the last to do that.

Tom says the party is over.
It looks like it's gonna rain.
Tom said I might not want to do that by myself.
Safety is not guaranteed.
Tom didn't offer to help.
I think Tom will be truthful.
I assumed Tom had told you that I would be here.
Did you know I was going to be arrested?
She's a despicable human being.
Tom already intends to do that.
Get off your school uniform.
I suspect Tom will have to help Mary do that.
I'm afraid I can't.
I know Tom is almost as high as you.
The first time I met Tom, he was only thirteen years old.
Tom says Australia is his favorite country.
I suspect Tom has never done that.
I thought we could help out.
Didn't you know Tom lived in Australia when he was a kid?
I would like to stay longer.
Tom plans to do that today.
You're the same age as I am.
Tom and Mary say this will be the last time they try to do that.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Tom said he wished he gave Mary flowers.
They said they had alibis.
Tom was able to do what he needed to do.
I knew you wouldn't like Australia.
I couldn't think of anything.
I wish you never told me.
Tom won't know I'm here.
I don't think you're as good as a driver as you say you are.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary had to do that.
They told me they were lonely.
What time is it now?
Tom said things went well.
Tom told everyone he didn't know how to speak French.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom was in the hospital.
Tom said he didn't know where Mary learned how to do that.
I doubt we'll be able to prove that.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom couldn't speak French.
Tom was surprised that no one else was there.

This is the first time I've ever eaten in an Italian pizzeria.
Tom said he couldn't clean the pool tomorrow afternoon.

I thought you said nobody was going to be here.
Tom thinks Mary is pushy.
I'm skinny.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Tom drank less than Mary did.
Tom said that he assumed that Mary would want to do that.
One cannot do a lot of things at the same time.
I can't remember her name.
The father works.
Tom and Mary say they're not afraid.
I'll save you a piece of pie.
I thought I was going to be asked to give a speech.
It is a privilege to meet you.
Tom seemed surprised when Mary told him she had to do that.
Tom said he thought you could help us today.
I'm used to stay late.
I thought Tom looked happy.
Tom said Mary should do that somewhere else.
Nobody seemed to want to do that.
Tom said he knew that he might not be required to do that by himself.
No one told you about the meeting, did they?
I know this is Monday.
Tom says he needs to find someone to do that for him.
I think Tom was supposed to be here right now.
I know Tom and Mary are divorced.
Tom must have seen us.
I know Tom doesn't know he's not supposed to do that here.
I know that Tom was going to do that in Australia last month.
Tom has no reason to do that.
Mary told me she thought Tom was handsome.
I didn't know you were jealous.
I think both Tom and Mary want something to eat.
They said they didn't mind doing that.
I'm afraid I have some bad news.
I think Tom wants you to do that.
Tom said I was the one who should tell Mary she shouldn't do that here.
Tom and Mary said they're not sick.
I knew Tom should do that outside.
I wonder if I should.
I suspect Tom and Mary know something's going on.
I know exactly where I'm going.
Tom told me he thought Mary was retired.
What's your last name?
Tom told me he thought Mary had left.
Tom said he didn't think Mary would have to do that.
I know that Tom knows that Mary seldom does that more.
You're stronger than me.
Tom said he was getting mourning.
They said they tried to do that once.
Tom said he thought Mary would be in Australia for three weeks.
I should have told Tom not to believe what Mary says.
It would have been interesting to do that.
If you told me earlier, I would have dressed up.
I think Tom's scared.
Tom said he's sure Mary can swim.
What's her problem?
I think Tom's focused.
I'm not interested in this.
I thought the police were looking for Tom.
Why is everyone staring at me?
Tom has everything he needs.
They view foreigners with suspicion; I see everyone with suspicion.
I don't think I can do that better than you.
You could have let me know you were going to be late.
Tom's delicious.
Willingness to correct is a sign of wisdom.
Tom would never do that.
I don't think anyone else wants to do that today.
It's not as humid today as it was yesterday.
If I knew how to do it, I would have done it myself.
Tom repaired his bicycle.
You're not really planning to take pictures, are you?
He's two years younger than I.
Tom and Mary told me they were frustrated.
I didn't know that Tom had to do that anymore.
I thought you said you saw people do that.
It's obvious Tom's waiting for someone.
He doesn't watch TV at all.
Tom said he's reluctant to do that for us.
Give it back!
Tom said he thought Mary could help us today.
I thought the concert went pretty well.
I can't cook at all.
I thought Tom knew what we needed to do.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
I don't think anyone saw us do that.
Tom said he thought Mary might be able to win.
I wonder if Tom has another one.
Everyone except Tom seemed to have fun.
Tom said he needed money so he could buy something to eat.
Tom wasn't surprised that Mary did.
I knew Tom was finished doing that.
I'm not sure that's possible.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Australia with me.
I thought Tom was still in school.
I knew Tom would be the next to do that.
They'll be glad they didn't do that.
They say they'll buy that for you.
They say they don't need money.
Tom is unwilling to go by himself.
I know Tom didn't have to do that with us.
Everyone agrees it was the right decision.
Tom got out of the bath and put on his clothes.
I don't think Tom's planning to help us.
They say they feel better now.
I suppose you'll go to the dance with Tom.
Tom thought I might be required to do that by myself.
I don't think that's anyone I know.
I don't think Tom did what you say he did.
I don't think Tom knows everyone's name.
I don't think it'll be hard for Tom to do that.

Tom and Mary both lived in Australia when they were children.
Tom really thought we didn't need to do that.
It's not good for anyone.

Tom and Mary are both full-time students.
I know Tom and only Tom need to do that.
Tom said he doesn't think Mary has to do that today.
I suspect Tom and Mary don't like me very much.
I wonder if I can do that.
Tom really thought we wanted to do that.
I wish I could visit Australia.
She's eating.
He's the love of my life.
I think Tom is a good painter.
I don't think Tom knows what Mary's making for dinner.
It wasn't that hard to find a couple of shoes that fit.
I would never have allowed Tom to do that.
I promised Tom that I would go to Australia with him.
Tom sings better than I do.
Tom said he had a difficult day.
Do you feel like swimming?
Tom and Mary still hope that they can win.
Tom knows we can't win.
I don't think I could do that.
You're to blame.
I thought you said your car was stolen.
I didn't know that Tom would be faster doing that than Mary.
Both Tom and Mary lived in Australia when they were children.
If Tom doesn't, I won't either.
Tom told me he thought Mary was funny.
I know Tom didn't know Mary should do that.
I wonder if Tom really stayed in Boston last summer.
In his heart, Tom knew he would never return.
We're not ready to go home yet.
Tom should have eaten more.
I thought Tom was going to give Mary flowers.
Tom said that Mary thought John might be required to do that in the near future.
I didn't think we had enough food to feed everyone.
I should have listened to what my mother said.
Tom's waste time.
I think Tom was exaggerating.
I was convinced that I shouldn't.
Tom said Mary is probably still nervous.
If this is madness, there is method in it.
Tom told me everything I needed to know.
They told everyone they were upset.
Tom said he won't do that unless I help him.
Tom told me he thought Mary was sincere.
She knows about things like that.
I don't think I've ever heard Tom complain about Mary's cooking.
I suspect Tom and Mary are ready to do that.
What's the name of your pharmacy?
I don't think anyone else wants to come.
I knew Tom was very busy.
Tom said that he thought I might not have to do that until October.
What's worrying about you, Tom?
Tom is a traveling salesman.
I suspect Tom's not in Boston anymore.
Tom is convinced that he needs to do that.
This is the first time I visited Australia.
I knew Tom didn't know he didn't really have to do that.
Everyone knows we killed Tom.
Tom said he'd rather not go to Australia with us.
Dinner isn't ready yet.
I hope I'll be able to help you tomorrow.
Sure we could do that, but it would be really hard to do.
I could have saved Tom's life.
There's a good chance Tom's gonna ask Mary to the dance.
Tom told me he found an interesting book about Australia at the local library.
I don't think we can take care of ourselves.
Do you need a lift?
I thought I made my reasons clear.
Tom's someone I'm looking for.
Tom says he's sorry he broke his promise.
I think I just have enough money to buy the computer I want.
I realize that Tom will try to do that.
I'm very happy to see you.
They said they're cold.

Tom just did what he should have done last week.
Tom says he usually doesn't wear underwear.

I thought Tom would be happy about that.
I know that Tom would allow you to do that.
Tom told Mary that he thought John wasn't sleeping.
Tom goes to Boston every chance he gets.
I know that Tom never considered doing that.
Didn't you know that I was hoping Tom would do that?
They said they'll call you later.
I promise we'll listen to everything you say.
I think you'll enjoy it there.
It's not all that ridiculous.
I wonder if we have to do that.
Tom told me he wouldn't be able to do that today.
The fuse has blown.
Tom and Mary weren't able to help me do that.
Tom should have been interested.
I wonder if Tom really wants me to do that today.
It's not good to ridicule people in public.
We should have planned for this.
I don't think you need to tell Tom why you didn't.
They say they never did that.
Tom and Mary said they're not going to do that.
I know Tom's connected.
Tom said he needed to spend a few weeks in Australia.
Let's get married.
Get out of the fuck!
I think Tom's been to Boston at least once.
He leaves for Tokyo tomorrow.
I wasn't as helpful as I should have been.
Tom said Mary was living in Australia.
They told me they don't like to study in the morning.
You tricked me!
We're too busy for that, Tom.
Is this seat empty?
Tom said he wished he hadn't told Mary that he forgot to do that.
You're free to go.
I know Tom's confident.
Tom thinks it's pretty good.
Tom said he and Mary had a fight this morning.
Tom may lie.
I heard Tom lives in Australia.
Nobody told me I wasn't supposed to park there.
Tom could have taken the money.
Tom doubted that Mary would keep her promise.
Make sure nobody enters.
I doubt that'll ever change.
Tom told everyone he was bored.
It was clear that Tom was going to do that with Mary.
I suspect Tom's drunk.
I met somebody yesterday who knows we.
Tom told me he didn't have insurance.
I'm hoping I can live here with you.
Those agenda items were taken up and bloc for discussion.
Tom said he felt good about that.
I suspect Tom and Mary know something interesting is about to happen.
You know I need to do that, don't you?
They must have found out who I was.
I don't think I passed the test.
I knew Tom was a bad loser.
I don't think Tom's dead.
They said they didn't feel anything.
I knew Tom would like Mary.
I don't think Tom would be afraid to do that if you did it with him.

When she came to the place where the footpath led across the morning, she found small pools of water, and a lot of mud, so she threw the loaf into the mud, and strayed upon it, that she might pass without wetting her feet.
