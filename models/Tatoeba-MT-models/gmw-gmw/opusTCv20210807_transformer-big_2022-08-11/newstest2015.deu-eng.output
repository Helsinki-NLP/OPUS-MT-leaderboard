Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha Police Arrest 20-Year-Old After Fast Motorcycle Hunt
A motorcycle was confiscated after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stopping signals and drove on Burgess Road before turning off into the bushland, where the officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle, as well as a person who corresponded to the driver’s description, were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police are accusing a 20-year-old man of not observing a stop signal and reckless driving.
He is due to appear before the District Court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The indictment is that Webster attacked her while she was “unconscious, asleep, and could not signal consent.”
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the negotiation date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Rethinking the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put forward a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a civil right.
"Just as unions die, so do middle-class jobs," said Ellison, a Minnesota-based Democrat and deputy chairman of Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I am proud to introduce the Employee Empowerment Act together with the Civil Rights Icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities when discriminating for the organization of trade unions as for other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union forces.
Complementing the National Labour Law Act to provide an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation, to sue a civil court for justice – and to receive damages or fines – is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it’s certainly not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill suggest is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that trade unions have faced in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country – Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac encouraged Arthur and his staff to adopt a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their trade unions played a role in the creation of a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that “the workers’ rights to union and joint bargaining and action are guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would make sure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that the workers would have to organize and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly stated: “The right to establish associations in order to safeguard and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to diminish this right are null and void; measures aimed at them are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors provided a guarantee that “everyone has the right to form or join trade unions for the protection of their interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to found a union – and that this union would then be allowed to participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies – must be protected.
After these rights have come under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to reconsider the American ideal, whereby the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, work miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to shut down
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally stopped the implementation of a law in Louisiana that lawyers say would have presumably led to the closure of all five state abortion clinics.
This measure, brought into law by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, in June and scheduled to come into force on Sept. 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient admission right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can continue to carry out legal abortions for the time being while applying for such a right.
“The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law as they strive to obtain these rights,” Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing is set for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said doctors thus gain more time to gain hospital admission rights.
“Today’s decision means women in Louisiana are escaping a sneaky law that wants to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who had not joined the action and had also applied for rights of instruction.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declared such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a Texas law that would have forced most of the state’s remaining clinics to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that admission rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Abortion opponents argue that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some also welcomed the effects of shutting down clinics.
Only one doctor conducting abortions in Louisiana has patient identification rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, Louisiana state officials said they would not penalize doctors for conducting abortions while their applications for patient admission rights were still pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video homage for her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1,100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age in diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, preexisting preexisting conditions, and social and economic status also affected chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects a delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to counter the distances somewhat, she suggested a strengthening of the service of flown-in doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women more densely in their homes, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study showed poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer regardless of geographical status and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years of the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret falling homeowners numbers
The decline, along with an increased drop in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “core age group for garden products,” according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount people with a home spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular process of asphalting pre-gardens for parking purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, with an estimated $5 billion in annual sales.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest spending on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS, said: “Container gardeners are very popular with tenants, for example, because they can take their plants with them on a move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of gardening retail due to rising homeownership numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital Islamabad, around 1,000 demonstrators have stormed the state-owned TV channel PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, some 3,000 demonstrators tried to get to the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away they delivered themselves with sticks and stones equipped collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he refused.
The country’s army, meanwhile, urges a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and without using violence.”
After a meeting at Headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has been cleaning up more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the May parliamentary elections last year.
Protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to penetrate Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey appoints U.S. diplomat for spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has ordered the country’s oldest U.S. diplomat to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. embassy manager and Turkish officials had discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the reports from former U.S. analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report and said that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also targeted Germany’s most important intelligence service, Ankara, caused much more upset reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: train drivers threaten with consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike by the train drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The standout announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. concerns all transport companies throughout Germany, including long-distance, regional and suburban trains.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.

said the district chairman of the trade union German Locomotive Leader (GDL), Sven Schmitte, in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main direction of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW has announced that it will do everything in its power to minimize the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
The prosecutors presented to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvia.
The chief of the Calvic police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous binge-drinking-hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors submitted evidence of extortion by police officers and employees of the city of Calvia to the Office of the Prosecutor for Corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are questioned by a judge together with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the upset nightclub owners said the government’s nephew economy had a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about survival,” one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our livelihoods go out of play.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing fellatio on 24 men during a surfing tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the bad behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous alcohol-soaked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the Fellatio incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage are jointly charged a penalty of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist town of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several alcohol-influenced accidents, including the trend of "balconing", where people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony into the hotel pool.
The first spring day with wet and stormy weather conditions affects flights from Adelaide airport
FRÜHLING has brought a winter surprise to South Australia, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that started just before 8pm and caused almost 4mm of precipitation in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week provided an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell back to a peak of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The rough weather conditions have likely led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to start through.
Wind surges reached around 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing and finally set up at about 20.40.
The flight delay resulted in the delay of several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
High temperatures of 16°C are forecasted for Adelaide on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: It's time for a big network
Given the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with a very familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the listener to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a reason behind this: If the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
Does it apply to the Ekeltronic (Ekeltronic)?
No, typos: electronic) sector the rule that the world novelty of today is the electric waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And if, for example, you still have a tube television in the living room today, you just say that you reject television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the pressing of the Ifa on the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The layman, who used to blindly master washing machine and CD player, does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out in front of him with incredibly vain expert talk: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies", the press office promises us.
Yeah, are you okay?
What should you talk about with people who seem to be willing to spread such quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, it is mainly about the fact that we should connect our house.
So that the yogurt can reorder itself, so that the fire alarm on holiday in the Maldives informs us that it burns in the study level.
And wouldn’t it be wonderful if we got the air conditioning from the office on our soon arrival...?
Yes, this requires an air conditioner.
But a dream will certainly come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, say to her loudly "sucking!" - and at home the vacuum robot starts.
Crazy.
Everything turns out to be nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," an industry expert is raving, you can connect the washing machine to a headphones, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza in the oven still needs, but this is not helpful because we are in traffic jams.
From daily practice, we also know that if a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Another reason for this is that the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters, as rocket and mortar shelling hit their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, and the schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the rocket-holed communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed grenades from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Their 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels “a bit weird” to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the border with Gaza to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad stayed in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas farther away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still reluctant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily accommodated in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza heavily bombarded by Palestinians.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, “We will make sure that you acquire knowledge and offer you security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas’s call for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of air and sea ports in Gaza.
Israel calls for the disarmament of Hamas and the handing over of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most of them in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
As tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the beginning of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children in the world and the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy currently living in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU Vice Strobl questions NPD prohibition proceedings
In view of the NPD’s vote losses in Saxony, CDU federal vice-president Thomas Strobl has voted in favour of an end to the ongoing NPD ban before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU Federal Vice President Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should come to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is doing worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU head of state in Baden-Württemberg, the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had almost failed in the vote on Sunday on the five-percent hurdle.
A first run for a ban on the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at the time also had informants in the NPD top.
In December 2013, after long preparations, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not agree.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the Neuländer Platz refugees are now housed in tents.
The central first reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting from all the seams.
Now the interior authority has had three tents of the Red Cross set up next to it.
The district politicians were briefly informed beforehand - they are not very enthusiastic.
“These Hauruck actions continue to foment reservations by citizens and do not give district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the humane housing of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, Green Party chairman in the Harburg District Assembly.
Her party demands that the district administration of Harburg currently make unused houses available for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the rush of help-seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough seats in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for Homes in the Australian capital increased 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday’s RP data.
Due to this increase, the total increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data research director Tim Lawless said that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
RP Data’s figures show that Sydney’s home prices rose 16.1 percent last year, while Melbourne’s home prices rose 11.7 percent last year.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which was hit hard by cuts in government spending, where prices rose only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in properties for sale for the next few months, which would undergo the market "a real test".
"If you look at the consistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate, and the consistently low interest rate environment, home prices are likely to rise even further over the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of the managing director Peer Medau and attests to him posing "as a general".
The style of the university is not that, the communication says.
In mid-June, the Medau family had already been verbally informed about the request of the university.
The statement that the plans did not become known until July is definitely wrong,” Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "preliminaries or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for access, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is no mention of a nine-meter-wide road.
At the current level it is 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before,” explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will only be used by students of the university in the future, Pötzl does not want to apply.
There is no train parking at all, because as with other public parking spaces, this can now be solved intelligently.
Thinking about the neighbors
The Kinderkrippe Bergwichel, which is located on the premises and on the front door of which the access to the park deck would lead along, should not be affected, according to the university president.
Rather, he gives to bear in mind, "that this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the estuary to Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring secondary school.
So it’s about much more than the particular interests of Mr. Medau,” Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parent advisory board of the nursery, with the expansion of the street would be one of "the few natural spots of Coburg to be lost" is justified, "the reader can decide for himself".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, will inform the city councils about the structural development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery last week about the plans of the university.
Accordingly, the access for the new park deck should not, as before, lead via the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but via the Medau-Mountain.
This would mean that the narrow road would have to be extended in two lanes over a kilometre.
According to projections of the Medaus, traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
The city has not yet commented on the project.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the German league SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it matured over several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and finish my career in the national team,” the 2007 World Champion said on his Facebook page.
He thus goes to international retirement with a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because he wants to go on goal hunt for the Champions League winner from Flensburg for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new federal coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a long and good conversation with the Icelander, who announced his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me just as much as they will inspire my longtime players and my successors.
But for my club, I want to be healthy in the next few years, for this, longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed man had even had to fear his career ending in 2012 after a heel infection.
Due to Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which had later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Glandorf then announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass by any body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries that took place at short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
This includes some other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I realized that while I can control my head, I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf told Handball Time magazine in an interview.
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the strings rip, I'm always ready to talk," the two-time family father told the magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also became quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to go at least to some extent.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League win, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012 he also secured the European Cup of Cup winners with Flensburg.
German economy shrank by 0.2 percent in spring
The global crises slowed down the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell by 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was reported by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed down the economy.
Thanks to the strong start of the year, a total GDP increase of 0.8% for the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which ran through the Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "feet drivers" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association of the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
It is the largest cycling tour across the Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were delighted with the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After the registration in the club home of the Schützenbruderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace trip" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
The route, which was planned for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz over the Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On distances of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 meters of altitude and 145 kilometers with 1775 meters of altitude, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were cared for on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are happy and it was a great experience for everyone involved.
The organization went smoothly and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion from this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came, as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the poor weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We'll see you again in hopeful good weather on 30 August or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's relentlessly honest memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, polite activist, ex-prisoner, in "Mönch und Krieger" has put on paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought pieces for thought pieces, the Munich-born on June 1, 1947, wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by an appropriate lyrics.
And he is relentlessly honest: from onanie as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he leaves no human weakness out.
Also to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Wide space also occupies abstract, but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all of this he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and how not only the music shaped him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his imprisonment.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out everything unnecessary".
Between all the high-spirit views, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about fights in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, in which he targeted a tree frontally.
He is also relentlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and originated from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is reflecting on his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice: "Stop the crack.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton -- who were grown up when I was a child -- went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket shot.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner reading the newspaper.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions are better than in his father’s time, he gained insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoked, deep rise mazes with flame bumps and smoke and a lot of soot.
My father used to just lie in the tub and then you could slowly hear him singing because he was able to wash the foundry off.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had done that for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Henry grew up as a child without his parents' testimonies of love.
My father never hugged me, he never said, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mother was bad at the end of her life that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
He is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken over by the theatre.
It followed The Comedy of Mistakes, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started when he was only 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s, "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He learned in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while watching TV made me a star, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager had stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people "painted in black," Henry performed his comedy there over five years.
This was very unpleasant for my family.
I somehow wish it had never happened, but I don’t regret doing it.
It was a strange, unpleasant position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this “year-long award-winning light pillar of British television” was also a “grotesque parody of black people.”
By introducing figures who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef! among others.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing the time around or stepping a little bit on the spot."
Next came a documentary series for Radio 4 entitled What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him in school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, whites in pantyhose and a cabbage head in front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it.
Don't do it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few words in your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines of Othello’s last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do that.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head on.
"That's what it's all about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of error.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre and I couldn’t believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
“A small voice told me, ‘You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they’re repairing the computer.’
Instead, the stage manager announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible.
I can leave it to someone else.
"You play in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That was good too, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a thunderous voice.
So I'll stick with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry still has the head of a comedian – our conversation is full of humorous outbursts as he keeps imitating people.
I have decided not to do a stand-up comedy because I think this kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you always look for it, you drive in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live at Apollo when I feel like it, but overall I don’t get as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle part, and the end of a journey – I don’t think I ever want to give up on that again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Huthi rebels block roads in Yemen’s capital
In the conflict between Shiite Huthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party "Ansar Allah" said.
Access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Huthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
According to the newspaper, Huthi threatened to further escalate the conflict if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The Huthi tribe has been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have built protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to curb ‘spirit workers’
Kenya has begun biometrically registering all state officials to remove “ghost workers” from government payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, was a government announcement.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salaries even after they leave the public service.
In 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to fight corruption in the public service.
A review earlier this year found that at least $1 million ($700,000) per month was lost in payments for “ghost employees” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid in accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to make sure their data is recorded through biometric registrations, a government news release said.
All those who would not do this without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the message continued.
"This approach will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of officials and also clearing the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the 'ghost employees'," said Anne Waiguru, the Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will be brought to trial for the first time on 11 November.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, demand 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings.
A court spokesperson said on Monday.
The application states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and classic cars and charged Berthold Albrecht higher than actually paid purchase prices.
This also made the agreed commission higher.
Achenbach had purchased valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He spent 44 years in school, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershauseners and Kollbachers from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always supported by his desire to see people in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, we went to Bavaria in 1946 - in the freight wagon.
So the judge went to the Upper Franconian Senkendorf.
The teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this purpose, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometres to the nearest station six times a week, take the train to Bamberg, go there three kilometres across the city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a sleeping accommodation in a red-cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 fellow students in a dormitory.
In 1951, he took the first and in 1954, after three years of teaching, the second state exam.
Since Oberfranken did not have a teaching position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and attended the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Woman's Room" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980 after the school was dissolved in Kollbach in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were combined in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a retrograde in the now smaller school, the then Rector Georg Sigl switched to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to move to the current building from September 1982, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter retired.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had an additional workspace built on municipal costs and during the expansion in 1997 cellars, although this was not eligible under the guidelines for school buildings.
“Mayor Götz was very school-friendly,” Richter remembered gratefully.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government official who had responded to a lecture by a school council on justice and justice: "You must never forget love". Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the 84-year-old today.
And he had to learn, "It's not always possible." Whether he just means his students or just his own six children, it's not quite clear.
In any case, Judge’s actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students beat themselves, they weren’t given any penal work from him, nor were they conned to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there was a violet.
For the sake of the school, Richter maintained a good relationship as rector with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
After his retirement, he moved the non-partisan judge to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least as the last on the CSU list.
Judge was elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop at the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
If cyclists take a break on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of stops made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour together with companion trail enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Schotten Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Radeln und feiern auf neu entdeckten Wegen zwischen Nidda und Kinzig" the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and saw a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists took the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes of Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started in Bad Vilbel by bike, and the head of the company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring, were welcomed.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and mind: the rural women from Ranstadt and Lower-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, swedish, strawberry and cheese cakes, which were wonderful for the skillful cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, as he ordered another piece.
At the drink stand of the gymnasium Geiß-Nidda cold refreshments could be obtained.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserves it, after all, he has already fixed off bicycle chains again today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company manager still had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking-cure house by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Promotional director Tobias Hagen, who has been on tour since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004, was only able to take a short break, because he had plenty to do with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his staff and the 15-member motorcycle squad of the Hessian police using three phones and a radio, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available overnight capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa, the cyclists had a good impression when they left after one and a half hours: "Goodbye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive atmosphere and, of course, treats, such as flame cakes with well-cooled spring whites, had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors as members of the board of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen.
The three were clearly pleased with the "many operations in Scots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests were increasingly mixed citizens, who were as impressed by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for ‘conspiracy’ against government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local media agencies reported.
The police authorities did not make any direct comments.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) described her actions as part of the activities led by Islamist clergyman Fethulla Gülen against him and other persons in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
All of Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who visited Yazenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that there will finally be peace here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands, and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
She arrives with a proud tug of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
She has her own front experience.
Her career began with global management consulting firm Bain and Co., after which she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the parent company’s top post went to a younger male colleague.
Their salary was said to be nearly a million dollars.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private business knowledge in Whitehall: she became the Cabinet's advisor.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
As early as May, I described the chairman’s job with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside the first guard of the BBC’s own management hierarchy, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopol that calls for a comprehensive reform.
But what new incoming president would risk taking on everything and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, perhaps killing himself in doing so.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that weren’t enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC shrinking – power, money and status overtaking.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, comfortable collateral, the upcoming bargaining of royalties for the BBC is associated with special hazards.
For the modest sum of 145.50 pounds per year, the British public buys into the world’s largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households, and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I now get headlines on my phone and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a great leader, I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says degrading tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of the Republican governor of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday contained a derogatory remark about the Democratic District Attorney, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for misuse of official authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another one from Perry’s user account that denies the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
“I don’t approve of the tweet and deleted it,” the tweet read.
Perry staff did not respond immediately to requests for comments.
Although the tweets were from Perry’s official user account, it wasn’t clear who was actually serving the feed.
The previous tweet drew an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of driving drunkenness in April 2013.
Perry vetoed her office’s financial support when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry – who could potentially be a 2016 presidential candidate – before a grand jury in Austin this month.
The tweet reads, “I don’t always drive drunk with triple permissible levels of alcohol... but if I do, I’ll sue Governor Perry when he talks it out.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg’s office was not in charge of the Grand Jury investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of lawyers applied to the judge entrusted with the case to dismiss the indictment, arguing that the law proceeding against the oldest governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funding to the state’s Public Integrity Unit – which is based in Travis County and investigated in cases of state corruption in Texas – when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto led to a public complaint by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa Elections during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry responded to speculation that he would quit by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake saying, “South Carolina, we’re coming!”
Berkeley declares housing market 'normal' again
One of London’s most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in southeast England had “returned to normal levels.”
Homes in the capital were hotly coveted and subject to enormous price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set ceilings on mortgage loans in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-class construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since peaking in 2013,” adding that this provides a “stable trading environment.”
The real estate market in London was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the cadastral agency, prices in the urban area alone have increased by 18.5 percent in the past year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
The average selling price of Berkeley’s private, inexpensive, and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year, reaching 423,000 pounds at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made real estate in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some of them have also been deterred by the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric about a possible “village tax” before the general elections in May.
London real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which presented tighter lending regulations, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday shows a drop in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the real estate market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its forecast for London’s 2015 rise in real estate prices down to 3%, based on an already declining house price awareness.
Transaction volumes in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington have now declined by a quarter each year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, Berkeley’s desire for a home in the capital is a blessing, as the amount due for appointment sales amounts to more than €2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: “Demand for the right, well-planned product in the best locations remained stable and as a result, deadline sales have also remained stable.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year until the end of April - nearly a third more than the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40 per cent to 280 million pounds per year, and sales by 18 per cent to 1.6 billion pounds per year.
In a statement Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley is expected to meet current market expectations in the current year.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result to be 450 million pounds.
In the afternoon, Berkeley stocks were fixed at 23.96 pounds in London trade.
Naked photos of Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by hackers
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85th Oscars.
Naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were published online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from “The Tribute of Panem” confirmed that Lawrence’s photos were genuine and accused the hacker of “eclectic breach of privacy.”
The authorities have been notified and will track all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan were allegedly sourced through a gap in Apple’s online storage system iCloud, and the alleged “masterlist” of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It’s not certain how many of the images are real, although Winstead, star from “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house – I hope you are really happy with you,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious", however, denied that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted, "These so-called nude pictures of me are FALLED, folks.
Let’s start with the first one. *Wordplay intent*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied her the authenticity of the alleged photos.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They melted, so it could best be described, they slowly dissolve like a cardboard that you left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and maybe a little scratchy.
Then he shook his hand.
He knew very well.
He was prickly, like hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this prickiness was an affair that had just begun, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremblingly tender beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more secluded and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an older companion who thought Bevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a moist but paradise valley called Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaky, there were still spiders in the baths, naked snails had left their marks on all the windows, believing that they were all theirs, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting hand in hand with Ailinn on the broken deck chairs in the high grass and had enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had gladly jacked into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs in the roll of Enter had long forgotten him of an old song.
Your feet are too big.
Due to their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolete, just as the word obsolete.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have done, and just as people in books choose the from-teller-washer-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so in music they choose the ballads.
In the euphoria of the day, Bevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing in a coarsely comic Serenade Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn did not understand.
“This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller,” he explained, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
His father had always done that to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was little.
His father had played it with his own father, he said.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn’t a very funny game at the time, and it wasn’t very funny at the moment either.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
I had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz was not played, even if it was not directly prohibited.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single “if” in life.
People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a melody where it would end.
The mind as well.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was a musically expressed mind.
Although he was 10 years old without hearing from Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew about jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, there were no laws or constraints.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group gifts – gratefully as those spared from destiny.
People of African-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People who originally came from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent, as if by nature, and were supervised to ensure that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents did not leave the country as soon as WHAT HAPPENED WHEN IT HAPPENED--for fear of being charged with firing, even for fear of the flames consuming them next--had opened labneh and shishah whistleblowing restaurants, kept in mind.
Each according to his abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the abusive words that beetle had just sung to her could ever be heard.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge carbon-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why should your father have loved something like this?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, but he hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was something strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Beetle's sight.
There was nothing else to see in the world but her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
“If you say it,” she means without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Not your feet like that.
Maybe your ankles, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said, “I love you,” but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly the reason you like me," he tried instead.
I'm a bit perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It should have been weird.
When he tried to be funny, he often found himself in trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Beetle.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got out of her deck chair, threw the console around and spilled the wine they had been drinking.
Hollow blossom wine, so drunkenness was not an excuse for him.
In her excitement she seemed to tremble, like Palmwedel in a storm.
"And your fat head is exactly the reason I feel perversely attracted to you," she said.
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and for the fear that was manifested in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was going to beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and ice-cold ocean broke down here as it did on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more sad after what had happened when it was their ancestors as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she didn't pay attention!
They first kiss - kissing was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, a counter poison to the meaningless love ballads from the console - they first kiss and then beat them.
In Kevern’s view, this was an unnecessary refinement, as Knutschen itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got out of the reclining chair like an old man.
She also felt bleed, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him walk away - as if from a room on the upper floor her companion was watching him - a man, complained by something he himself had conjured up.
Adam left the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, even though some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bent his back, embarrassed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, when she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the events just mentioned, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative body responsible for monitoring the public mood, was working on a short lecture on continued low- and middle-level violence in precisely the parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, was most likely to have been invested in the violence that was extinguished in view of the money and energy.
“A lot has already been done, and much remains to be done,” she wrote, “to appease the innate aggression of a people that has waged a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the country’s remote corners and valleys, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically rarely been felt despite the evocative church towers between the hedges.
But some traits turn out to be indelible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to awaken.
The population cries at hearing sentimental ballads, intoxicates themselves with stories of overcoming difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only does the former rawness hold the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in the hand, but there is also evidence for the emergence of a new and sneaky quarreling at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even on the fields.
“They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,” her mentor said as he read the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," replied Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Once again, Esme appealed to her right to privacy and denial of the statement.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," said Luther Rabinowitz at last, "because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is an unprejudiced workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
You obviously have prejudices against the Church, and those things you call “backward” and “raw” could equally well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural force and vitality.
If one continues to ride on what happened when it happened, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away its essential vitality from the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice that Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at her neighbor, appreciate her partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speak is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written word, but nothing is better than love.
"I totally understand what you want to go for," replied Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice when she was sure her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we are pretending to be.
My concern is that, without warning, we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to what happened when it happened.
This time, however, it is not the others in whom we leave out our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To imply an angelic patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “when you call actions “errors” that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
They also go too far if you talk about them missing out on their “rage” and “misrepresentation” to “others.”
It shouldn’t actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past as well as protecting the present, we’re not talking about “us” and “others.”
There was no “we” and there was no “other”.
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not suing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
There is nothing to be said about this - we agree on that.
And just as no guilt has to be assigned, so no guilt has to be repayed if such repayment would be appropriate and if there was a way to repay it.
But what does the past serve if we don’t learn from it –
The past makes us forget it.
If I can say something -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will remember her report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, when she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passersby described, had gone on the footpath in a kind of "brutal anger."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said they were taking action against police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country’s army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting threats of assassination.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was de facto no coup, but that the military was responding to the threat of “political fanatics” whose armament by the police was imminent.
“What happened this morning was that the staff of Lesotho’s defense forces acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements were acting within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were on the verge of causing devastating damage,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had made the impression of a overthrow.
“Even though no one has claimed to have stabbed the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho’s defense forces have so far shown signs of a coup,” he said.
Spokespersons for the Lesotho military said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
In the meantime, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the administration during Thabane’s absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There has been great tension in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the disputes in his united government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite other accusations.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed in August to the lowest point in the last 13 months, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
An indication above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced burglaries in a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets expect the bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the eurozone and for the impending deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information over the course of this week whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the eurozone, in line with those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the decelerating effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers have become clearer," said Rob Dobson, lead economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as is Italy’s descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives are no longer relevant in the key industry mechanism Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, is also not reassuring,” said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing you can say for the August manufacturing purchasing manager index is that after that, the sector continues to grow.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone are currently apparently finding life quite difficult, as the current increased geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – are increasing uncertainties in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence, and are likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it would be “more and more likely” that the ECB would eventually have to launch some kind of QE, “although we suspect that this will be limited.”
The decade of hell of Beslan’s survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children entangled in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias in a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the start of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and East into disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is now coming to an end.
The girl photographed while trying to climb back into the ruined school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she was only trying to climb back into her underwear after a mine exploded.
Aida searched for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were overflowing with blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought herself completely healed, but said yesterday, “Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need to be operated on again.
Some grenade chips are still in my knees.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it didn’t break me,” she says.
“That happened to me, and you can’t change that.
Once a year I always go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, dreaming of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory gets a little weaker each year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our catastrophe and help to ensure that this does not happen again.
The boy who fled through the hailstorm thought his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at 7 years old) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the age of seven, he said, "Mommy told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Frightened that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed his hand and fled through a bullet hail.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son in his arms outside, said, “Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and had been injured in the hospital, assuming that her son had died.
After her reunification, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (from the now disbanded News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Premier Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering,” he said.
But I can say it's going to be paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that’s no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard and didn’t make it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London very well, especially to the toy shop, where I could choose anything I wanted, and the ride in an upstairs open car.
But now he is afraid of places like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I am so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities,” said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I'd love to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir vividly.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London, and how the Damir and me helped.
I remember Damir liked to eat borshsh and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shot at them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I always think this world hasn’t gotten any better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now going on, and people are dying every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are children just like ours.
I think for many, war is part of the news they hear when they’re bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that’s so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not looking for revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it -- I remember sometimes lying on the sofa, turning his face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, bigger than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can’t believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around, and saw hell all around me, with body parts lying all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
“I remember calling him, ‘Damir, run, run away,’ but I was also so sure he hadn’t heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life goes on, unlike that of many others, for us.
George Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrible image became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, on the right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-filled face was scared as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan’s barbarism.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she rushed off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
“I left the courtyard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed him, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days,” she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only George managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There’s not a single day we don’t remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from these days are always chasing me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise.
Intrusive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was perpetuated as a statue (right).
I remember Georgij so eager to go to school that day, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of crying Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at home.
I understand that, but I also mean that people all over the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: “It’s important that such a thing can never happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming something terrible.
“I can’t understand how that’s possible, because when you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget about it.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the gym when September 1st approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I'm not sorry.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical college in Vladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn’t allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgij Fanijev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgiy Fanijev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle that he wasn't killed.
“We feel like it was yesterday,” says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but could not do so because of his health damage caused by the siege.
It’s still with me, it’s not something I left behind.
I’m older now and people say that kids can easily handle bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“I worked with psychologists in 2006 and felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgij Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I wear it with me every day.
My friends know I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn’t study at the FSB’s Secret Service Academy in Saint Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my documents, including the medical ones, and they replied that it was not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals “from cats to cows.”
He said, “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about this and they should not suffer either.
His mother Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse, as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations for remembrance.
I know Georgie won't go.
It has to be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited for him at home and couldn’t help.
I am so grateful to God that he was given back to me.
It remains within us.
Georgij is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept this when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has been operated on several times, he can walk but does not exercise.
I would say that he has overcome the horror by 50%, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege, and that only exacerbates my pain.
I lost a lot of people that I knew well and that were expensive to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but my heart is weeping for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart leaped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we fight now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many are still being killed.
If only we could grab and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby who was carried to safety by a special commando
Saved: Aljona Tskayeva is taken to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
He is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all.
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian police officer from the siege of Beslan.
The terrorists let her go, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school gym in her cruelty.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Svetlana, which he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into a smart and happy girl, say neighbors.
"They're now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up on the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.
Man accused of driving over girls on pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The prosecution says Mr. Steward controlled his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charges before the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC initiated the procedure for January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available at a price of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for the dazzling underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models in our shopping guide and reviews.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams don’t usually.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see this underwater, and the right image setting is a matter of luck.
So take a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode that takes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the poor light conditions.
It is especially important when working with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means that you need to get closer to your objects if they are to fill in the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthetic consultant, he devoted his career to saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the torments of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors care about the diagnoses and diseases, while those treated are predominantly concerned with something quite different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble picking up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently reproaching his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather have everything right now than later,” he wrote.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and for no reason worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to perform an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago he was in the French Alps for skiing.
The result of the X-ray was present.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the breastfell, i.e. the skin covering the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer sufferers have previously been smokers.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance", but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to stop using it.
Also, where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it seems hardly worrying today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the climax of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, this disease kills twice as many people as in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma develops only after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we learn in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore, mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament buildings are asbestos contaminated.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be healthy, we have already been identified as the starting point of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was also not a plumber.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I was training for six years,” he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gatekeepers - use the tunnels.
Wondering how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least partially.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have contracted mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last to live."
How many of us will get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends fatally.
So we can only repeat Lawson’s question, “How many of us are going to get sick?”
Britain’s leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to come to a halt in Britain, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim to it.
Most of them have no idea they’re going to die like that.

A brief look at the files of the courts, to which the persons concerned often turn because of claims for damages, shows how widespread the scourge of mesothelioma is already.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations – one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos refers not to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings today.
It has been used for attic panels, floor panels, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered by the EU and WHO to be a “large health risk” with possible deaths.
More dangerous, however, is the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (krocydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates.”

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto’s work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure was probably caused by work or in-house asbestos contact in the environment."
Much of these contacts, he says, are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume that they are safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even at the heart of the government, may have been unknowingly exposed to the material.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be swirled up by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of Parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a “clean health certificate”, it is now undisputed that 1 billion pounds of work has to be done over several years in order to renovate Parliament, modernize the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, MEPs will be more likely to meet in the nearby QE-center.
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the respective regulations."
No one knows if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked at a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were positively decided,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked on and the data.
What he remembers exactly is the day in early December 2009, when he got a fever like that.
He was 45 and had surgery late at night.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I didn’t think I could make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was from the breastfell, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn’t go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleuracathethers to remove fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his complaints remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his job.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient with similar symptoms came to his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his family doctor took his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott felt ill for the first time, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cave between the rib and breast fur.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
To be honest, I didn’t worry so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott's Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to seek a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings, where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sickening.
And so Mesothelioma now meets younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who ate in pedestrian tunnels from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did), were most likely in contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for the patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
It is still being removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it’s not just hospitals.
Asbestos, due to its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties, was commonly used in offices, shops, libraries, and town halls.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Throughout the country, in thousands of hours of chemistry, students have put their bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
The topic of asbestos is now often addressed on websites in schools.
And in the meantime, such innocent items in our homes, such as floor slabs or shed roofs, have contained asbestos by default.
“It’s an industrial poison that’s contained in large portions of our properties,” notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear down your garden shed.
The impact of the diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
“It takes a while to process that,” Graham Abbott says.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to have another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very difficult to take up all of this," he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How long do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not going to see another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life-saving mechanism – the breathing itself – that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is swirled up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the breastbone, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the breastbone and can trigger cell mutations.
“The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart thorax doctor who switched to Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is inherently invasive from the very beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some think it’s worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the breastplate," he says.
They don't get around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still struggles.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow victims four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he cheerfully introduced himself on calls.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that lasted four months and were expected to extend his life by only one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to “make things appear in a slightly more positive light.”
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart Thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage because I didn’t have to be redirected, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would need to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers face another financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in hopes of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s was that they realized that even a very low level of stress posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled their case, but it wasn't what Morgan called a "full compensation" because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after investigating his death, a Guy’s spokesman confirmed that “the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How asbestos can be removed
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation, it’s a huge problem attributing the deadly asbestos contact of a company or workplace – usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who fight against claims know that the time is right for them, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there have been clear new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to sue for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer available.
The law has set up a 350 million-dollar insurance fund for all those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove a contact but can’t sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages trial – about -120,000 pounds.
Approximately 300 successful applications for the programme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks, like so many people affected by mesothelioma, that 350 million pounds was a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal by insurers for insurers,” he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have paid if time hadn’t passed and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then Minister of Labour and Retirement, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that in the face of seven deaths, rapid action was necessary every day.
“People are suffering so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation, from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to present a survival rate of up to 40 percent over five years.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That's of course with the most important thing," Abbott says.
This is repeatedly seen in patients.
There's something that keeps you going.
When you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had completed the last of the six chemotherapy cycles.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
That's life-ending.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
No trace of the tumors is now visible.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm out, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
When you receive bad news, you become negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, this is not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I wouldn’t grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and rude.
She told her friends and we soon got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma sufferers, such conversations are not filled with hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease (as well as Stephen Jay Gould) brings grim safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China Denies Hong Kong Right to Government Election, Protesters Swear Retaliation
On Sunday, despite the increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 election by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-announced protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists initiated planning and mobilization within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-Peking candidates.
“It won’t come unexpectedly, but it does make us angry,” said law expert Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
People have lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice-Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said the admission of public nominations in the elections would be too "chaotic" for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the residents elect the presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong’s citizens a direct right to vote, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is holding tightly in hand the process through a Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates “with love for the country and love for Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the biggest and most popular protests in Hong Kong in several years have taken place.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real general suffrage.
On Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong’s government headquarters.
During the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they planned waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers said that the movement "considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing’s announcement for days, and there were tighter security measures including police forces and barricades on Sunday in front of the government building.
The riots are intensified by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland intensifies competition for products and services.
In addition, fears are growing that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement’s demonstrations for endangering business operations – the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
“The protests they’re talking about could cause great economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long they last,” said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong will get out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China’s state-controlled media also recently reported on Hong Kong’s democracy activists as Western-controlled subversive agents.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights involving 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest demonstrations of democracy in the region’s history.
The tradition of graduation balls in the U.S. is now being transferred to the universities, where Freshmen is being offered performances by private plane.
We look forward to responding to this demand and offering the UK’s first luxury student travel service today.
To make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to drive their belongings around the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to making sure this year that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesperson said there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that “students would book the service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said that it expects a market for this offer despite the tuition fees of ,000 pounds per year.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago – it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as lifted.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NUS for Higher Education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis of living expenses, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep up with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student dormitory.
Feminists criticize racial question and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands up and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender ahead of race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequalities.
However, while tensions in the Midwest rose and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that white women’s responses were 100% about the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays with titles such as “Thoughts of Ferguson from a White Woman” and “Feminism isn’t just about oppressing women” came relatively late.
But for Perez, that was an important change.
“I don’t think you’ll find a lot of people in feminism who talk about whiteness and privileges in such a high-class way,” she said.
People felt urged to express something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light issues that black Americans face every day, but are not considered “women’s issues” in the cultural space.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere,” Mitchell said.
When I post something about how colored people are under siege in their own country, silence is deafening.
“How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about security in public space?” she asked.
For black women like Mitchell who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating subjects cleanly; they live in combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender research at George Mason University, says that her predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white women’s rights fighters like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for voting could only succeed for one group each: women or blacks.
“They made the decision to stand up for women’s suffrage, and black suffrage should come later,” Hattery said.
When you remember such things, you become aware with power of why colored women do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were given the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to Ferguson's questions - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catches" with the problems black women have been grappling with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?”
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the fight for reproduction rights and access to contraceptives, are now trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, Guardian columnist, calling for more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding an inherent danger to the body - and opinions about the race, which are significantly different in public surveys - will lead the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the racial issue in America are astounding.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of “Who Stole Feminism?” told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “far more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s comments about Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police with the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming to the surface – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to reconsider the issue as an essential women’s issue, she just had to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories are reverberating in women’s organizations,” she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich is for sale
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for 120,000 pounds.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - which included a pig that had his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo has been mistakenly published and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the house’s exposé, Connells described the former meeting house as a “unique single-family home with one bedroom.”
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The sale of the house attracted interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is up this month
The search for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth continues, with a lucky winner earning nearly $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery draw.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said the profits provide talk material in the small town in southwestern Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is quite excited.
We thought such a profit could happen.
Eight WA winners celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August, after a couple from Belmont had made a $7.5 million mega-gain just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years, saying the win allowed them the possibility of a world trip and buying a new home.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of nearly $85 million.
Leonidas bat in the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely inspired by the historic spectacle.
There was a colourful series of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the times of the Romans and their significance for the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighting force of the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used each rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the arena prepared with soft sand.
The gladiatorial owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and one after the other sent his men into the ring for a heroic duel in various gladiatorial genres.
At first, the "provocators" were in line with rectangular shield and short sword as well as leg rail on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
This was followed by the "Essedarii" with chest shield, short sword and throwing lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who competed against the "Secutor" with a net, trident and dagger and pushed the boy to the ground after a short fight.
As forces the swords metallic to each other, the shields created and the throwing lances flew rushing through the arena that could scare one about the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of Roman times tangible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for one day, a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans have not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired at Roman Day, for example "aqueduct marble" from the eleven-metre-high and 1,400-metre-long Roman Canal bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft contrasted the water and energy supply once and now, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time".
This is also confirmed by graduate surveying engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "Engineering Team Two" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocuit, the warm air heating that once heated the Roman villa.
Impressive also are the footprints left by wolf and fox two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burnt.
In 2011, the Office for the Preservation of Soil Monuments at the Rhineland State Association excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
They had found walls surrounding an economic building with a darre for drying cereals and malting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass display case, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a delicate necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In her, the children also dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote their names on wax boards with metal handles, like the Roman students once did.
At the booth of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the booth of the Glass Museum Rheinbach and use a heavy stone wheat mill at the booth of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center to grind the flour for a flatbread or a cereal.
The visitors drove through the amusement park with the original Roman coach, drawn by two cold-blooded people, and also passed by the impressive state of the Urban Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also contribute to the Rhineland-wide proclaimed Roman year 2014, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2,000 years ago.
Together with the home and history associations as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, theme walks, a lecture, cooking dinners and guided tours for school classes are offered and commemorate the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire is told about his work on the trainy Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era and a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and drawn-in Romans is offered.
The Adendorf Primary School is devoted to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made experienceable again.
In the Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkum Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is straining West Africa’s economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the West African economy.
The harvest rots on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has been hard on the region.
Some international companies are also already at a distance.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, it is also an economic one,” said the head of the African Development Bank, Donald Kaberuka.
Liberia is the hardest hit
“It’s a total disaster, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes on the second largest market in Liberia’s capital, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola come to the market.
Liberia is the hardest hit by the virus, here alone more than 600 people fell to the fever.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had penetrated to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1,500 people have died, and thousands more have been killed.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies are suspending operations all over the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as the steel company Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers also react: Few merchants still leave their home towns to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are quarantined, the cocoa and coffee beans that are important for export are rotting in the fields.
Farmers do not dare to leave their homes for harvest.
Food is scarce
“People are going to travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on the economy of West Africa.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore feeling the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the supply of basic foods such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, threatens to damage its image – with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
Determine how far and for how long the virus will spread.
“Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus to invest,” Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the burdened state budgets
The disease also weighs on the already burdened state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody’s fears that their budgets will be heavily burdened by the high spending on the healthcare system and in addition by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already promised to help the healthcare systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where few Ebola cases have been diagnosed so far.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also declining significantly.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The shooter association "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At the Schützenverein Tannenwald, the preparations for the 50-year founding festival from 12 to 14 September are underway.
It is planned on Friday, 12 September, a great evening of conversation with the group "Dorfrocker".
On Saturday at 6 p.m. is the big böllerschießen.
Then in the big festival tent is the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30am in the parish church and the big parade at 2pm.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gauschieting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 festive ladies with their Dirndln.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage was taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room stucco and small caliber shooting".
The Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the club in 1937.
It wasn’t until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on 30 April in the Lukas inn the "new" shooter club "Tannenwald" Berngau lifted up from baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult initial period, in which it was mainly about finding a club location and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who were now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club's records were falling every year and the magical limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the membership numbers have also developed positively.
After the club premises "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future residence in the basements of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2700 hours of work, on 8 May 1988, Pastor Strasser granted the church blessings for the new shooting rooms.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th Gauschieting, combined with the solemn consecration of the new shooter flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
A Böller group was founded in 1995.
Josef Schmalzl became a Böllerreferent.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böller meeting in 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting facility at the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
You can also see the sporting achievements of the shooting club.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the lap competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann climbed from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the Bezirksliga 1 in the round 2013/14.
The second team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has risen from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as buck stinging, carnival and royal ball, club excursion and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart Succeeded in Accident on Return to the Racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart drove against the wall for the second time after his right front tire burst in lap 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team boss Chad Johnston said his 14-strong team was disappointed, but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
“I wish we had a better bet and a better result for him,” Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
“I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work out.”
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tug and the team had packed and was ready to leave.
Stewart dropped out of three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car met and killed another rider at a Cinderella race in the north of the state of New York.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who had stepped onto the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said on Friday that the investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
No decision has yet been made as to whether Stewart should face an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had already advanced into the first 10 and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs fell
Cars with the No. 18 out of control after the exit from curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued to drive, but fell back to number 21.
Young dancers looking for
Just try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and head Lisa Neitzel (from left) look forward to fellow fighters.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn also have to provide full-time lessons at secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated.
We are now increasingly looking for newcomers for a sport that is healthy and fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old says.
With more active people, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
If you want to dance, you can enjoy the training sessions on Thursdays between 5 and 6 p.m. or Fridays between 5 and 6.30 p.m. in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
“The training starts regularly with a warm-up program,” says the trainer.
Afterwards, various choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not too short.
"We also go to dinner, watch dance movies and we have stayed in the dance room before," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If you don’t like jazz dance, you can also get a taste of one of the other offers of TV Jahn.
Children and young people can always get into the lessons on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you like discofox, slow waltz, Viennese waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango, you can come and join us.
Bulgarian prison guards protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their calls for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The officials have been protesting symbolically for a month against the new working hours and are calling for a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General for the implementation of penalties, Rosen Zhelyazkov told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are on the rise.
After heavy battles, allegedly involving Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army today, Monday, abandoned the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
The army also said seven soldiers had been killed in the last 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian Separatists Shot Down Airplane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have reportedly shot down another fighter plane and two military helicopters.
Some 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two boats of the Ukrainian Coast Guard in the Azov Sea for the first time.
Ukrainian border guards confirmed that two of his ships were under fire near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told the broadcaster 112.ua.
Two crew members were considered missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported that they had brought several villages in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk, the Ukraine Contact Group meets today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, a representative of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicly announce their demand.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council of 1997.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of “a blatant breach” of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side indicate that “they consider us opponents.”
Stronger NATO Presence
Rasmussen has also announced that it wants to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A “readiness action plan” to be decided at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that “we will have more visible NATO presence in the East as long as this is necessary,” Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have formally agreed on new talks to settle their gas dispute.
Negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still waiting for a decision by the European Union to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the gas price, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger recently intervened between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also interrupt its gas supply to Europe.
Europe draws about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: toll will come "very clear"
Now the Chancellor has made a clear commitment to this.
But it is not a license for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car tolls have become increasingly angry at the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a car toll after continuing resistance from her CDU.
“To be clear, it is in the coalition agreement, and it will come,” the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU’s top committees in Berlin.
But for the time being, Merkel was not determined on a detailed model.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal and is now working on it.
However, the NRW-CDU insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also contributing constructively to the discussions for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for investments in infrastructure, including broadband expansion.
Schäuble left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is testing its own concept to remunerate motorway investors with toll revenues - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the Cabinet.
CDU Federal Vice President Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
“The coalition agreement never assumed to toll all the district and federal roads,” said the North Rhine-Westphalia CDU state chairman.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to speak again about the issue.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
There are fears that a toll will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded loyalty from CDU coalition ranks because of toll criticism.
The left sees the plans as failing in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette duty on all German roads, which should start in 2016.
Domestic car owners may not be charged additionally under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax.
However, under EU law, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all of her youth in the belief that she had only a few years left to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are believed to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gait and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Peace Kingdom Ataxia (FA) – a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same as the others.
I fell down all the time and it took me longer.
I could never ride roller skating or skateboarding with the other kids and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendon and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA Society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and terribly panicked.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between would slowly lose all my skills.
I made it all up with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not decreased as much as she had imagined and asked her doctor.
He just got up and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, or you'd be in a wheelchair right now."
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, her CMT was detected.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Stabsfeldwebel a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworks worker since the closure of the former troop training ground
For almost ten years, there has been no gunfire at the former troop training ground in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month at the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they need to be blown up on site.
A deafening bang resonates over the heart of the biosphere area during the explosions.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot was taken at the Münsingen training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6,500-hectare area has been at the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated paths.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year as economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and companies in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local agencies in fiscal year 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent compared to revenues of $26.6 billion in 2012.
The state and local tax burden of companies increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining resolutions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes increased more than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by the service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from companies.
Virginia has the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28%.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in corporate property values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these profits came from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the process seems to be true for the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 – an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent real estate asset recovery isn’t as effective in raising state and local tax revenues in Maryland as real estate taxes amount to just over a fifth of corporate tax receipts.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“The following is happening in Maryland: a large part of the real estate, especially in the tax area around D.C., is either owned by the government or by nonprofits that don’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone
Business revenues also seem to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is going in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies does not rise evenly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent to the national average, while the rise in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes, with 6 percent in all three departments (all three have fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district is relatively high 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower state and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia, and overall there is a better tax climate than in Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates from 6.9 percent to 6 percent this year, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and so they are paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small businessmen – a transitional structure by which most small businesses are organized – in the District, Maryland, and Virginia rose by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is likely to continue this year, with an increase in general multi-defense tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, Washington could be lagging behind if the federal government’s spending cuts impact the region’s labor market.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt’s partner city Guangzhou – this is the urgent wish of officials in China.
“We would be very happy if a German brewery were to settle in our city,” Li Yiwei, vice-party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, said during a visit to a SPD delegation in his city this week.
Over the course of the talks, the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party repeatedly returned to this concern of the Twelve-Million metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also called canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China, advertised Li.
Therefore, people also had the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would look around in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
“It doesn’t take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre,” he added during lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiated Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou started with a shepherd's gibber - but with red wine, which was served at the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German Reinheitsgebot.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice-Chef Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but it was cancelled in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be worth it again,” the local politician said.
“Trade between our two cities continues to grow.
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the flight connection.
Deputy Governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish to the fore in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea," Schäfer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded approvingly.
Well-maintained partnership
Guangzhou’s deputy party leader hopes to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came into office this year after his predecessor was promoted from office for allegations of corruption.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being vigorously enforced by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the automaker VW built a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as all of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year, it wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Family of Joan Rivers "presses the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was hospitalized in New York City three days ago, but her daughter is now hopeful that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We all push our thumbs.
According to sources, her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency due to a cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors will intentionally keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which is still described as “serious.”
The reactions came from many pages, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that will be on the market from today.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from September 1 on which the buyer can recognize key data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, stricter nitrogen oxide values apply in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for scaffolding builders: they receive a nationally uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon to Acquire Twitch for $1.04 Billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported Monday morning: The online retailer – and video producer, and a host of other things – is buying Twitch’s video streaming service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover from Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service was decided for a cool billion, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their brawls in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre in which know-how gives the (mostly older) games a paint of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often mentioned when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about as the company reportedly was willing to pay as much as Amazon.
Emmet Shear, president of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they prefer to play sports rather than watch it, it’s hard to understand the attraction that starts from watching others play instead of taking control consoles into their own hands.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3:00 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something quite different to watch a spinner get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control of the eye perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast runs in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me already know about it?
Twitch is accessed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth-largest source of internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will be integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube could have easily swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would like to have: thousands of young men who are advertised.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of gaming,” and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even – swallowing – as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was correct.
Despite the heavy rainfall on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the Burggarten.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salt swirl l light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in the Salzwedeler Burggarten should radiate brightness in the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was evident early on Saturday, when the first visitors set out for the open air.
A celebration for all generations was promised by the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Salzwedeler, but also guests from the surrounding area, had made themselves comfortable around the utilities on the Burggartenwiese.
They followed the first live performances, waved with their feet in the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were necessary.
Throughout the generations.
While some lumped on blankets on the extra-carved white sand at the beach bar, others lapped at a quarter of wine in the vinotheque, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a big attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in child make-up, the volunteers had to do all the hands in the true sense of the word to master the urge and to conjure up imaginative creations in the small faces.
The bigger ones took advantage of the kicker tables or participated in a skateboard workshop that the Goodfoot crew organized from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5.30 p.m. he knocked down on the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dryness.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not detract from this.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success across the board."
That is why there is nothing to prevent the big party from repeating next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made it clear in a first statement on Sunday against the popular vote.
As annoying, he said that in the meantime the entrance had to be stopped.
Apparently, the security company had been booked with too little force.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the site anymore.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors who were huddled in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel Hip-Hop-Band Blocks-n-Rox broke off their performance.
The technicians were not able to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel due to a tire breakdown.
“But next year they will be there,” the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula-Open-Air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
Even on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to critique.
"Sorry, but you just expected more for twelve euros," Melanie Meier said on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you have taken over a bit," says Ele Zimmermann at the same point.
Others do not see the initial problems so closely.
I find it very good that some don’t just talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hats off!", writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
Now the organizers have a year to dismiss these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: almost 50 years after the construction of the space observation radar TIRA, the shell, the so-called Radom, is completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
The size remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new cover is the cap replacement
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new cover is placed.
If the weather plays along, the action should go on stage at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge discards pine
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she hurt the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge was painful.
A woman was hospitalized after screaming so much at the ice bucket challenge that she ran out of the jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Great Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated her facial structure.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I was doing that, my jaw just stopped,” she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn’t work, the jaw was chopped, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost got into their pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to get the jaw reinserted after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs be pulling together again soon?
Lastly, there was always a dispute between the two Wolfratshaus castle clubs.
Now the boards are considering possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon, France.
A year ago there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
Up to now, the views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus castle and a possible reconstruction seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks about a common approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the association’s board of directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down one day,” Sjöberg says.
In his view, all members of both clubs could be pulled together again in the future.
Thus, they can be seen faster.
While the friends of the castle around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until the end of the day a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in mind, the castle association around Sjöberg is the "development and experience" of the site at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the castle friends, was very pleased about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been in charge of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
The club currently has around 40 members, according to the 74-year-old.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first stopped the club's activities out of respect," this "thinking phase" was needed to "think how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman should then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also get a current mood picture within their group.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, Piffl says.
"But I am confident that someone will find themselves." He himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
He said he would like to “continue working on the project.”
The different views on reconstruction will probably persist in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He recognizes Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Due to the high participation of the population and by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was also skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to drive the project forward.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the Burgverein might move a little on this point.
Their goal of first documenting the story is “important and good.”
After that, you could look further.
Smart Ways to Save on College Books
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the fast-second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from high-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who attended Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that students spend an average of more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study materials, but that there are different cost mitigation options for the students.
Online shops and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for the students.
Leasing textbooks becomes more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university bookstores, said that textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of books were rented in college bookstores last spring semester, Neebo’s vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here’s the one-off for the best deals.
Buy online
Some new books only cost a third of the price online, for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be purchased from specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Used buy
If you don’t mind the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is used on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand edition of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business.”
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if previous expenses are permissible.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
Besides Chegg and Amazon, Half.com by eBay Inc is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Leasing textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don’t want to keep the books after the course has finished.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent “Calculus” for about $20 for the duration of a semester.
Find out about the terms of the store where you are renting, including the penalties that may be incurred for writing notes, underlines or traces of use.
Tenant Attention: If you don’t return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literary courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around anyway.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson on the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why 'Guardians of the Galaxy' Didn't Become a Cashier
Sylvester Stallone’s “The Expendables 3” raised less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For” raised just $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The film "Sex Tape", tailored to Cameron Diaz, only paid $14.6 million on the opening weekend, while children's movies like "Dragon Taming Made Easy 2" also disappoint at the revenues.
An article by telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that children's films may be the cause of the lack of quality in the films themselves.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year ever" for children's films and described "dragon taming made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy continuation.
However, when it comes to films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer film launch shown between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and at least 2,000 screens this year.
The results are based on the opinions of cinemagoers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s upcoming jungle book film, told Hollywood Reporter, “I think times are changing.”
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix has recently generated $1.2 billion in streaming content, nearly double the previous year’s revenue of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and prophesied a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential cash hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
Producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, recently described the decline in cash results as simply “cyclical” and told Hollywood Reporter, “Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore.”
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was cancelled in order to tighten the league division, this was a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has added an additional 3rd Bundesliga to the programme.
The result: those who have not ascended have descended.
Göttingen’s highest-class team torpedo in the Oberliga-Relegation has avoided the descent, but will only play fifth-class in the coming season.
Fourth-class Torpedo ladies remain, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as do the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglers and the torpedo reserve compete in the new Verbandsliga, in the Landesliga there are no more Göttingen clubs represented.
For the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new Bezirksoberliga Süd.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC compete.
In the district league, Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the district class of the TTC II, Red-White, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are part of the game.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the district league.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
The SCW Boys’ District League season – where Torpedo II is still starting – is also not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV enter the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen Kreisligen start with nine teams each.
In the West-Staffel are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play in the East-Staffel.
The women's league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at the district level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd class districts achieves the desired strength, here the innovative and active district board will have to think about.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend there were protests from opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in front of the city hall in Cardiff to hold a so-called counter-top.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments on the weekend and spoke to demonstrators who travelled from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teens flew out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers were brought to safety with the rope winch after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man left for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search squad of local police and emergency services broke out and the couple was found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 11 p.m.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and had his head slammed open.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were taken to Blue Mountains Hospital in a stable condition with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
The approximately 1,000 demonstrators had been pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, said information minister Pervaiz Rashid.
The broadcast resumed after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
No deaths or injuries were reported.
The protesters demand the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said it was about a kilometer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s residence that clashes with security forces again occurred on Monday.
According to the hospital, a police officer was injured.
On the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 injured as protesters attempted to penetrate Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict on Sunday evening after a meeting at Army headquarters, “without wasting time and without using violence.”
“The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has fueled concern for military intervention, which has been plagued more often in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have continued since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers on Sunday to persevere.
“We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign,” Khan said.
Qadri said the same.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary elections in May last year.
Qadri called for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and declare new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially peacefully persisted in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to advance to Sharif’s residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer after the second victory of the season in third place on the table.
With the 2-0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has taken a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the Aus in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who advanced to third place with green and white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Victory Road Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes into the international game break with a success experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory in the 14th minute with his magnificent leader Volley from the sixteenth track.
"I thought I'd cut all the frustration from Thursday and snagged him under the latte," the 26-year-old said, smiling.
When Schrammel had hit on 13 November 2010 for the last time so far in a Bundesliga match, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid-Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
“For me, that’s something very special, I’m from the rapid offspring,” Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term pelvic injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience that he can also practice this position in a mirrored way.
He has earned the goal, he has already done some assists this year,” Barisic praised.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2-0 by Hofmann after a good one hour, which finally brought the decision.
Before that, the guests could have written.
“Thank God we have had some luck today,” Schrammel noted, referring to the gap between performance and result in the past few weeks: “The results did not vote, but the play was always good compared to last year.”
Barisic even found that he had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that played in this stadium this season."
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proven that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
No less so for him: “That we finally played to zero again.”
Also, the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger had several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger gave their starting debuts, makes the victory even more valuable.
"Don't forget that," Barisic, who lost over the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "which have been very stable lately."
The international game break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and gain a bit in the physical field," said Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his ranks.
One who is particularly fond of the break is Captain Hofmann.
He tears himself for the team, goes over pain.
Especially in this difficult phase, he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids the structure before his exchange in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old who played his 350th Bundesliga match, it was the first hit out of the game since November 2, 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "Don't believe that everything is good now" "We've certainly had a bit of luck, but at some point luck must come back to us.
Now it was high time," said Hofmann.
Of course, he urged concentrated work: "You should not always see this in black and white.
We have not played as badly in the last few weeks as it has been portrayed.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They stick to me at certain stages,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick match "from the category Magic Gate", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly rejected by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that in some phases we were not concrete enough towards the goal.
We have had too few conclusions.
Defendant Maximilian Karner said: "It started badly, but then we found it and even scored a goal.
By and large, there would have been more in it.
There's a calm under this rock
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "My piece of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants are still present in the county, the depicted specimen is the "geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak tree.
It passes by couples, basalt stone clusters and basalt stone seas.
A little below the quarry of Bauersberg, one kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
Vital looks like the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees in the area and reminds with a circumference of over eight meters of an American mammoth tree.
A small Buddha on a tree stump suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what the geißruheich is all about.
The result of his research remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, until about 80 years ago the goat shepherds drove their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the laboriously eroded and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the ascension-depleted animal keepers are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because in the meadows, goat herds actually graze again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider has found out further.
However, you should be careful when entering the stone collections, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place for crusaders.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are signposted, ascend the direction of Hochrhön and invite to an extended hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
However, a water castle, which is sought at our next task, is rather rare to find in the height.
The reflection in the ditch gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the district that could fit the building counterfeit.
Where is our "Piece of Rhöner Happiness"?

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy’s Prime Minister and acting EU President Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative resistance at the EU’s special summit last week, enforced the nomination of his Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, who will succeed British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica portrays, the appointment of his Mogherini as a favorite in the government team as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost for his “reform package” in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the ever-consuming left-wing party base, because Mogherini is assigned to it - albeit rather in a moderate manner.
To the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Poland nominated as President of the Council Donald Tusk, the prevailing opinion in Rome, so that a political balance is established.
At the same time, the EU’s chief diplomat will be the deputy of Commission President Juncker.
The pending approval of the European Parliament is considered safe.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica propagates optimism that the Mogherini, which has been proven in leading party offices for almost two decades and is known for its ambition, will be able to meet the "huge challenges".
The native Roman is married and has two daughters.
Her political career began in 1996 in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Sinistra (left-wing democrats), which merged with the Catholic Center Party Margherita in 2008 to become today's Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party politics, working in the foreign policy department, whose leader she soon became.
It occupied traditional focuses of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies of NATO deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the over 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini has a part in this, as is noted in PD circles.
The remarks in Brussels that the new EU Foreign Representative has too little diplomatic experience, i.e. lacks substance, are countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, Mogherinis is mistrustfully pursued realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course".
It supports the pipeline South Stream, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe, bypassing Ukraine, which also serves the purpose of Italy’s energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief for an October economic summit in Milan.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training professions: electronics technicians (three apprentices), mechatronics technicians (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All trainees come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new apprentices previously attended secondary and secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all age groups as well as the trainers will go to a team building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the programme.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and around the world.
The number of apprentices across all age groups is 27.
The socialists in France should “keep silent and put France in order,” Francois Hollande’s most important ally said.
Mr. Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose reorganization of the cabinet has been disapproved by the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It is our duty to stay by his side,” he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France, despite strong calls for an easing of the regime on the part of Emmanuel Macron, the new minister of economics.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to show "united" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Minister of Justice, sprinkled sand in the gear, in which she appeared at a meeting of apostate socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "believe in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists’ constant trench struggles, saying she couldn’t imagine the new Vall’s government going to last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but neither does Prince Manuel Valls, they are forced to form a new government when the old one has not even survived a summer.
“And the new one will also not survive the fall or winter,” Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament and said she was confident that she would emerge as a winner in early elections and was ready for government.
The ruling party of France suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of disintegrating into several rival factions before the end of Hollandes’ 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment rates.
“There’s a small window for opportunities, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen further.
Norwegian Cruise just ahead of a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the third largest cruise line provider in the world, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for approximately $3 billion, according to industry connoisseurs.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company, access to Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruise ships and wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced already this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could also end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous, as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
Overall, the cruise industry is about $29 billion, and it is expected in the next few years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
Companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises filed an IPO with the U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created in its current form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise liner owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
At the end of June, according to regulatory authorities, Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo held 20 percent of the shares, and private equity company TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises jointly own 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises’ IPO.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A loyal group swung the Chinese flag close by.
On Sunday, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates to run in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with loyal members.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to elections and prompted pro-democracy activists to make their threats come true and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial centre with “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper that outlined China’s dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the election process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li’s interview is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee’s Legal Commission, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau State Council Office, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists said they would meet in front of the Hong Kong office in the afternoon.
Britain did not provide any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start 'statehood talks' with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports on Sunday, demanded that the Ukrainian government stop fighting the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “statehood” of the renegade region.
His spokesman, Dimitri Peskov, later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine under the control of the separatists would become part of Russia, but that his status towards Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent his rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the outbreak of the riots five months ago: help the separatists capture territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossia region to gain de facto independence for an alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state-owned TV channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the separatist-held territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossia" or "New Russia", a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary peak of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the course of Ukrainian politicians’ campaigns for the 26 Oct. elections and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the separatist-held areas, hope for soon peace talks “are trapped in their illusions,” Itar-Tass reported.
“We need to immediately record in-depth discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood should be seen in context with the greater autonomy that has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not about a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine.”
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks underscores Russia’s leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the East as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty in annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and pre-conflict polls showed a broad majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine authority to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to most of the Russian Navy as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that make important components for the Russian military.
In his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Porozhenko proposed that Ukrainian legislation, after new elections, should consider additions to the constitution, which would give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose armament and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on an equal footing followed last week after a further advance by the rebels after Russian troops and tanks invaded eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoazovsk in a sweep, which Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a steel industrial port of 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novoazovsk and the narrow access to Crimea peninsula.
Poroschenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urged action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are close to a point where there is no going back,” Poroschenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on concrete actions, the leadership demanded the draft further sanctions against Russia, which should come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reported Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers included in the Russian invasion of Ilovajsk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured in Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal around Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not hide his anger at hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a who's who of Hollywood's A celebrities.
The film town is in a state of excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the internet in a hacking scandal around celebrities.
The hacker probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "The Tributes of Panem" and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, as well as actress Kirsten Dunst.
From Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne, private photos were reportedly also made public due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who got engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was “disgraceful” and that those affected felt “injured.”
The hacker presumably has 30 images of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she is lying in a pool without it.
Palmer’s film “Love Is Invincible” starring Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available for comments on the hacked images yesterday.
Lawrence told TMZ, “It’s a heinous breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a mobile phone is nothing more than selling Hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, redistributing stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were there yesterday at the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg and have thus supported the association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder".
The tour, which was a torture for some, was an easy training for the others.
But everyone agreed that it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel Brewery went on a bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily put the small muscle sore away, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) also brought him personally a valuable knowledge.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do that - fine!"
Little whispers on the way in the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would've been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday in early dew and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to cross the eleven-kilometre-long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The green politician from the district day - red dress, red bike - made a bit of understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there is the goal!"), but then turned out to be half a professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also crossed the track in one go, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokeswoman of the city of Oberursel, who had made his way together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we would like to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway", says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning, to step back upstairs.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung himself in the saddle at 9 a.m. at home, "made" the Feldberg twice, and then rolled home with fun.
I also had fun with fries.
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of this.
He had been aiming for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - that's what I like to be with," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says that he is an "ambitious road cyclist".
He must be, because he was on the "Fixie-Rad", these are also racing bikes, but without circuitry...
That it went loosely up without a bike proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed over the White Wall and the footprint to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights on a cord behind him.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with four-wheeled bully and quad, ensured safety, said: "I know this" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sled track, only that he stops the sled himself.
The 718 participants – and thus as many as never before – were sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30 a.m.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf dem Großen Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that he will be able to block the route up to the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
