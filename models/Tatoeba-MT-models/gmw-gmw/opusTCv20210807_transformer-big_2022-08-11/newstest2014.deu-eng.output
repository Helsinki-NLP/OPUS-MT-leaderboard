Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters from each other: on Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light was put into operation at the village parking lot - within sight of the older city hall traffic lights.
Two systems so close to each other: Intent or Shield Citizen Strike?
Gutach's mayor clearly answered this question yesterday.
"The town hall traffic light was installed at the time, because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank, as well as the traffic flow from the residential area "Grub".
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another traffic light had to come up for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
“According to current measurements, around 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy goods traffic,” Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Security simply proceeds here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, also a roundabout was planned, but because of the tightness in the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested in the location selection of the traffic light masts: "With the help of an extra for us loaded van with particularly long wooden trunks, we showed whether these vehicles can travel from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending the traffic light masts".
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15,000 euros, is the “modernest thing on the market today,” explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights of the drivers can be easily seen, for example, even in low-standing sunlight.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is free, immediately comes green for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
A further radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be terminated for the pedestrian.
"If a group or people with walking disabilities cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone is safe on the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think along as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green, an upper-class vehicle rushed through - with bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth from his soul for more than 30 years.
The cataclysms of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the propensity to brutal violence and dull sexuality, the tightness and joylessness - have been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is known primarily as a prose author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Weather lights on the top of the tongue", which can now be seen in Garage X at Petersplatz.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prose miniatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie bewährend" (2003).
On the largely emptied stage - an important prop: a crumpled sofa, on which it hints to copulate and masturbate - the eight-piece ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance impresses the template with a wealth of directing intrusions, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, with their heads dipped under water, with their evening robes tapped on the wall.
Squeezed into cellophane or bodice, they staking on dangerously high stools through the staging, either monologizing loudly or lying completely silently on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly communicates in this strenuous way.
The best moments are the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
It is only towards the end that the overwhelmed performance comes to rest, and Winkler’s absurd humor flashes.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can take place in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record each mile driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the outdated system to finance U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are advocating that the government can use the small boxes to record the miles driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax bills.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system where drivers pay per mile driven over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is truly a must for our country.
“It’s nothing we’re only going to possibly use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, who plans to record the miles driven by all California drivers in the state starting in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, funded by taxes, is broke.
In America, however, there is not as much fuel as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per liter) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a cent at high fuel prices.
“The fuel tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a miles-based payment system.
“This is the most useful long-term alternative,” he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea is well received by urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way that traffic jams and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
The Californian planners rely on the system in the development of strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally enshrined goals on climate change.
But Pennsylvania Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea of having drivers pay by distance traveled.
“This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole,” explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, called on Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push, responding to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas representing people who often have to travel many miles in everyday life on their way to work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several states and large cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the miles instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering this as well.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could track any of their movements.
“Concerning Big Brother and things like that was a big problem,” explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test arrived, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on individuals’ daily movements.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can use to track the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
That, Khan said, would make the public more calm.
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially step in to help states tax drivers.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are to pay based on the miles driven.
But the devices she tested are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more willing to get involved if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of choices.
You can opt for a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t choose any device at all and instead pay a lump-sum fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that can also be used to pay parking fees, pay insurance only for miles driven, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, allowing drivers to avoid traffic jams.
“Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the system’s advantages,” the city said in a planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or an annual fee could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," said Randy Rentschler, the Commission's Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
When we do, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Königsfeld: Small team is waking up
The volunteer fire brigade met their main test in autumn, despite a shortage of personnel.
Only 11 men participated in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise acceptance.
There, a short circuit is supposed to have been created during sawing.
The resulting fire and smoke caused two people to be injured, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
Two respirators of the Wehr prepared to enter the building after the first inspection of the situation by Hans Kammerer.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead them outside.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and strawballs in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was made via an overflow hydrant at about 100 meters distance.
Three extinguishing attacks have now been carried out.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what can be done with little available personnel.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided by the Königsfeld daily operation group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking of universities and companies important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, President of the Landtag, Guido Wolf, was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workers of tomorrow are coming from.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald he investigated this important question together with the managing directors of the vocational schools as well as the district high school and the parent advisory board chairs.
"Education is an important location factor," underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans Thomas School, who presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, the Kreisgymnasium and the Vocational School Center in the forest city.
He also praised the family-friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to look at the family phase, but because of the demographic change also the phase around the care of relatives," explained Wolf.
He also pointed out that more and more employees were taking care of their loved ones.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to a termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he continued.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already learned about the benefits of the region during their studies often retain their acquired knowledge and skills in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the President of the Landtag.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the skilled workforce needs could also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport.
“Continue to be persistent and make sure public transport is getting better,” he told the local politicians.
Experience a fun afternoon with music
The Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper for 15 years.
In the past, the older fellow citizens were hosted in the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place at the nursing home St. Joseph.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
With popular melodies Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich talked.
The more than 100-year-old stone wall, which is the front delimitation of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße before the renovation, is to be added to the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days leading up to the Kilbig, a small corner wall was installed for the stabilization and static relief of the more than one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade during the first work of the renovation of the front school yard.
According to Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure is to include the Land Monument Office in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts, which is then to be placed on the table for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision is expected to be made next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school inner courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure, the wall in need of renovation must be renovated from the ground up and placed on a new substructure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old delimitation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, in need of remediation and has an arc inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which has been done by the current fortification work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses brought a shift.
An important word for the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If specifications come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the conservationists.
The students of the Bräunlinger Grundschule, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old school yard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also participated in the ongoing discussions about the future of music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it's wrong to give up the holistic education at the Stuttgart University of Music," Özdemir told the Stuttgart News.
Jazz and classical music belong together at the jazz location in Stuttgart.
Thus Özdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered a favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on September 22, contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, it is pushing for a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, the Jazz and Pop degree program will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
US border: 'super tunnel' to drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the US, investigators have discovered and shut down a “super tunnel” to drug trafficking.
The U.S. Customs authorities said the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested and eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated.
The tunnel has not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar," said Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy at a press conference outside a San Diego warehouse where the one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Speaking to the drug gangs, Duffy reassured: “If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make that a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both the U.S. authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by experts
Due to the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track system was equipped in such a way that electric cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
He would also have been able to promote illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for confiscating marijuana.
All three face life imprisonment as a maximum sentence, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, according to the press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the “despair” of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug search DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were disclosed about the detainees, at least one was Mexican, it said.
You have to face prison sentences of up to 10 years.
2014 will be a festive year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250s.
The return of the first documentary mention is approaching.
When the year comes to an end in eight weeks, the anniversary year is here.
Geisings and church houses were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches, a document was made that mentions both places.
On March 15th there will be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen does not currently have a hall, this opening event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, a number of events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church Houses will be the 1250th in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrate the return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend there is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commission composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on the 27th and 28th of September.
On the occasion of the Geising city anniversary, a new chronicle will also be released.
"But it should not only be a chronicle of geisings themselves, but a printed work about the geisings of today, which consists of geisings, church houses, leipferdingen, auldingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And today's geising also celebrates its birthday in 2014, in 1974 the present space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a customary evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 years old and has the banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the Bezirksmusikfest from 1 to 4 May.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the fountain festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a certificate of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then the courthouse.
Both communities are mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014 is also 40 years back.
Council targets track systems
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be rebuilt in an elaborate manner to increase road safety?
Yes, the councillors decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros in hand.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at railway crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must contribute a third of the costs, the rest share railways and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the Bahübergang "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the tunnel mouth west of the railway track.
Larger vehicles, for example those transporting longwood, could also stand in reverse traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber proposed, therefore, to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversial in the municipal council, as some councils questioned the need for road proliferation: Thomas Kipp summed up the sentiment of the critics with his statement: "Should we take so much money in our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transports.
Even wood from the Kuhbach area is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn off in the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it is foreseeable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and refurbished, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have it investigated what the planned broadening of the street would cost.
Nonetheless, the reconstruction of the railway crossing was largely agreed with the proviso that the necessary supporting wall was built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" to about 5.5 meters, if necessary, for encounter traffic.
The conversion of the railway crossing at the tannery Trautwein, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which affects the access to the rapidly rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had had the reconstruction plans of the railway examined by the engineering firm Breinlinger, because they had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles sitting.
In turn, the city bears responsibility for this as a road haulier.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the bending functioned in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other railway crossings, because the stopping point in the middle is located directly next to it, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be decelerated at this point to such an extent that there would be no collision.
The majority were denied consent to the conversion of this railway crossing, because the city of Schiltach had to "bath out" the problem with seated vehicles, according to the councils, as the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The panel considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" as unproblematic, for which crossing agreements have already been reached with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes – experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they plan to launch in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Far-away worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there is life in at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These are the questions that the European Space Agency (ESA) is asking.
For their program "Cosmic Vision", they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that are intended to make decisive progress in research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were under discussion, five of which have now come to the narrower choice.
Numerous committees review the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee.
The Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision program, initiated in 2007, are to find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes for the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To answer this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is to be launched in 2017, which will be used to investigate 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, but Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, should ultimately provide information on the prerequisites for the formation of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined by way of example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and monitor the Sun's surface and activity closely.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter of stars, planets and living beings like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together, and dark energy through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the Esa has already approved an M-Mission, whose launch is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is intended to study the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus allowing conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
In the opinion of many experts, the best chances of obtaining an L-mission have been "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for the detection of gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven yet.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes that is stationed in space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that originated in the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, among other things, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to survey cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to track down and investigate Earth-like planets.
Suggestions for sample transport back from Mars, for exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics have already been eliminated.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: “Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissent as a breach of fidelity and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make this possible.”
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by the claims that the NSA has listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MEP who heads the Secret Service’s parliamentary committee, said we should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Ströbele, a Green MEP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Ströbele stated that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, then he needs assurance that he is “safe” there, the MEP said.
Snowden explained in his letter that he was facing a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that drove him out of his homeland.
However, he was touched by the global response to “my act of political expression”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have called the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers cooperation to the German authorities “if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been solved”.
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers wishing to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who paid first at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee aims to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she explained.
Airlines began charging fees for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore packed as much as possible in their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are one way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
These are the most loyal customers of Frontier, who have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry one piece of luggage free of charge at the gate of Frontier, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O’Malley said Frontier’s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before coming to the gate.
The new hand luggage fee from Frontier does not take effect until summer, an exact date does not yet exist.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that the transport of luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wished it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, so far, most have left their fingers on baggage fees.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand baggage three years ago, followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand luggage fee brings in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate if passengers were confronted with the company’s unusual hand luggage fee.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in my aviation career,” he said.
I was expecting to see gnashing teeth and handy discussions at the gate.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding ran like lubricated.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the entire can and refill coffee free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later, after passengers complained and no other large company followed.
Frontier’s move to charge for hand luggage when passengers don’t buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them rather than through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A flight booked with a third-party provider with Frontier over 1000 miles therefore brings customers only 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined by 9 percent and flight capacity shrank by just under 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get control of Frontier’s finances as part of the company’s sale.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women attended this year’s last women’s breakfast in the Evangelical parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the town hall were "proverbs from the Bible" and "speech from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, addressed the Bible proverbs after breakfast in a lecture.
“Words contain life’s wisdom, regulations, or warnings,” she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
She used proverbs such as: Wooden eye be vigilant, like dandruff falling from the eyes, throwing an eye on someone, to whom the Lord gives it in his sleep, washing his hands in innocence.
Several times, the speaker had his listeners also guess what proverb it was.
The church councillor Christel Dehner took up the phrases from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, do blue, do something.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called “bridges into the past.”
Finally, a tombola was released.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for the unemployed in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unlearned people in the industry will be qualified as professionals for hotels and restaurants over the course of three winters.
"New to this is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert from the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
NSA declares an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for website crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had paralyzed its public website for a few hours rather than hackers, as claimed online.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update,” the spy agency explained in an e-mail sent message.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users.
A NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not compromised in any way.”
Secret information is not in jeopardy, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency, finds itself in the bright light of public opinion and faces sharp criticism after the revelations made public in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and released by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
In October, the number of people without a job fell slightly by 22 to 1,307.
Although the ratio was 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Many companies have reacted so far with attitudes.
One reason for this is according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any specialists in the crafts, health care and elderly care".
As a result of the seasons, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have also been received since September.
The winter season starts there in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Losses in profits for Bombardier after decrease in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit after falling orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the rail sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September, according to the ambitious schedule.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago has only been followed by three more launches, which makes it seem questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
Results were lagging behind forecasts, leading to a fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his valuation from “outperform” to “sector perform” on Thursday in view of the stock having limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were widely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the aircraft series of the CSeries can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was introduced to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate as potential buyers want to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet aircraft are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Pierre Beaudoin, Chairman of the Board, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company’s management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program is on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that during the aircraft's lifetime, ground tests and software updates were scheduled.
Every manufacturer is planning differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, the company said.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical about whether the first customer can commission a CSeries aircraft twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it over the next few months.
“The slow progression of the flight test – even though it obviously corresponds to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” said Doerksen.
In the third quarter, which ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, the year before.
Adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly and fell from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order inventory in the aerospace division amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were within our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this segment have risen by nearly eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The order inventory in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September, slightly increasing compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some large contracts.
According to the management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In midday trading on Thursday, Bombardier’s shares dropped by 8.5 percent, reaching $4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google’s Chief Financial Officer Patrick Picquette will join the board of directors.
Brazilian Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management via the short message service Twitter said the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly being informed about the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
Eyewitnesses said they had seen a shooter with a rifle in one of the departure halls, according to several media reports.
A traveler told CNN that many people had sought shelter in panic.
Travelers would scream and children would cry.
Panic broke out among the waiters, many hiding behind chairs for fear.
He has heard two shots, says a traveler to the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA had suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
He was then taken to a security area, the man said.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
On television pictures were seen numerous ambulances and police cars driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken to safety from the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a special operations commando and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30am (local time).
The access roads were blocked, which led to a long backstop, according to CNN.
Except for landings, air traffic has been temporarily suspended, it said.
However, there were also several planes on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly operated by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-Addicted Lawyer Warning Drug Boss of Police Investigation Must Go To Prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, Shared Information with Underworld Size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug lord of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld great Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed “Bash,” was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough (32) deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar lunch with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain illicit information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash in a series of home searches.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of impediment to justice.
He admitted cocaine possession in a previous survey.
The lawyer was convicted after police discovered in their investigation into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs under the lawyer's trash box with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after tests discovered class A drugs in his hair, his wallet, and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied taking cocaine, saying he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, claiming that their discussion was under the “lawyer’s secrecy.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he operates an office at both his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was announced that he had called for significant arrests and informed key actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of misuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to share information with Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: “Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defense lawyer to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigation against Ditta, which also resulted in a conviction in three cases for cocaine possession and judicial disability, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to the conspiracy to trade heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to 153 years in total for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America as a lawyer, that his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and that inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the festivities on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the singing wreath will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs to Celebrate the Sacred Sacrifice of Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is performed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the wind band of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism weakens confidence
With the elections to the Parish Council in 2015, for example, fundamentals will change in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because there is nothing to change about the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the scepticism towards the new deviates hesitantly but increasingly with confidence.
From the ideas and expectations for the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the principal officials of the pastoral team ranged.
On the basis of a presentation, Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
In the future, SE Haslach will form a public law body as a parish church, which enters into the rights and duties of the six individual parishes.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the pastor Kraft Amtes is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed locally.
In the future, their task will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the area.
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations stipulate that accumulated funds are retained in the parishes.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the entire community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which then meets all parishes, there were great concerns.
"In the past, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the committee in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had made it their mission in 2006 to “become one, stay five” and had to find that it wasn’t so easy.
The boards of the Haslacher pastoral unit then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The drafting will be concretised in further meetings and decided in a further joint meeting of all six committees next spring.
In the end, parish councilor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Electricity is getting more expensive in Pfullendorf
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to prepare for higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorf family has an additional cost of 70 to 90 euros per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is rescheduled every year in October by the four operators of the major power routes.
These quantify the additional costs arising from the energy transition, which they can charge through a levy on the electricity price.
The Stadtwerke Pfullendorf is the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now, the concrete figures would have to be calculated before Stadtwerke could inform its customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We assume an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number more likely to be close to the 2 cents.
Traffic lights on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a light just doesn’t turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What do you do when you’re driving red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to persevere for at least five minutes before assuming a traffic light malfunction.
Anyone who continues the journey despite red lights, however, must be aware that he bears the full blame for an accident caused by it.
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns and refers to a decision of the Higher Regional Court Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation – but the fine was not.
City Council welcomes sound budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The Gemeindesäckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well-filled and the administration has not known about debt since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be recorded as a complete success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was about 7.6 million euros higher than planned.
At around 1.8 million euros, the surplus of the administrative budget is also around one million euros above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the municipal share of the income tax.
The asset balance was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
“This is mainly due to the higher inflow from the administrative budget,” says Rothmund.
With fewer investments than planned in the financial year 2012, the reserve intake has also been higher.
Overall, the overall reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to now a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a piece like that out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts.
He and the local council were clearly pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost citizens a lot.
Due to the good financial situation in the past, the municipality was able to do without high lifting rates.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies from the country have been reduced many times.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various compensation points.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain elevation rates.
"We have to look at the topic of lifting rates, as there will be investments in the coming years, for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At 60 years of age as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s story at the men’s singing association Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the herb festival, in the context of which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing association.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir that has become more than beloved.
Wermter was also active in the club, including as a member of the committee for 28 years.
For his commitment and his loyalty to the association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German choir association as well as a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the award, the 31st Autumn Festival went in familiar ways: The MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music association had invited the Vollmaringer to a colorful mix of different choirs and vocal styles, which the around 400 visitors entertained.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Hustig, Brüder".
To their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Federal Song".
The men's singing association Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durch das Tal".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten provided with his mixed choir and his women's group - the "impuls choir" - for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, abducted into foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to the local fields with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which the children spent the lunch well.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centers in the Zollernalbkreis get mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wants to support the institutions in the realization of their construction and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centers and nurseries from all over the Zollernalbkreis can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or embellishment request for your facility, you can apply with it to the Black Forest Messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Kindergarten-Baustelle action.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The desire should be realized with building materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on one (action) day.
In addition, the winner must take care of many diligent construction workers himself.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and should then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs, and of course the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one can ask oneself: what prevents Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” was read in the newspaper, which considers the bill to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the President is listening to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
In contrast, according to The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered “a severe blow” and have been described as “draconian,” according to The Star.
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping center in September.
The Kenyan media drew the anger of the authorities for publishing footage of security cameras showing how the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbed the luxury mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even though the subpoena was withdrawn after a scream from the media.
According to the new law, media houses can be charged with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists can be charged with up to a million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation, calling the Kenyan media a decisive control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
The Kenyan legislators have already in the past caused public annoyance.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Remuneration Commission and reinstated their solid salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for the FC
The importance for the city and the football club was not lost by the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field despite the cold weather and the rain.
Everyone would have liked a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for some reason.
That was the case with the musicians who framed the ceremony, just like so many speakers.
Nass became the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were first and foremost to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the participating companies and members of the association who contributed.
Especially here Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The cramped pensioners laid 400 square meters of pavement stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by Karl Rombach, Member of the Landtag.
Further greetings were given to the urban sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn added to the original lawn in such a way that it could not be played.
Already 15 years ago there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place was considered at the site of the football club or at the real school on Lake Salina.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts arose about the creation of an artificial lawn sporting ground, which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were made two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube in heirloom, promised a cost contribution of 100 000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining 356,000 euros in the total cost of 560,000 euros, Klumpp summarized.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter large artificial lawn square began on 4 June.
During the construction phase lasting more than three months, 3,000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt-bike route.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
The relevant working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, bribery of deputies and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, it should be about the topic of dual citizenship, in which both sides have conflicting ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to opt for one – the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the regulations for this Friday, the SPD backed its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a “flatrate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive,” the SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, explained in a letter to his group.
There were evasion traffic on country roads, which are already the focus of the accident.
The introduction of a toll for all cars would also be just a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing föhn wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When is it going to be summer again?" wasn't the question on Friday night on the open-air stage Killesberg.

Driver seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was traveling in the direction of Grefrath around 9:15 pm with her car on the Kempener Außenring.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the approaching car of the 37-year-old.
The vehicle collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left turn lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the driving BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW was also damaged.
A total of around 15,000 property damage occurred, police said.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it said.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will no longer be any such announcements at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A lot of the loudspeaker announcements are thus eliminated - the noise level should be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the discontinuation of announcements that affect individual people.
Among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai are already giving up the noisy calls.
Due to the elimination of these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls through the speakers sound in a day - it should be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements were relatively little perceived, but all other information about changed flight climbing or departure times also goes down a bit here," says Kleemann in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to pulling brake cars with tractors, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, 7 September, the Highlander Games will start at 1.30 p.m.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are hailed at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
“It doesn’t matter what’s going on,” explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk has to be thrown off vertically, should turn over once and then just come to lie down.
This is evaluated with most points.
When throwing horseshoes, it depends on the accuracy of the target.
From eight meters away, it is thrown on a peg.
The participants must prove their skill and strength when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a bottle are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two can then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
Appropriate clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the scotch skirt.
Swabian costumes are also allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury awards a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the music lovers come to their expenses.
At 7 p.m., the birabohemian wind music from Schömberg organizes the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleeting polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes sensitive waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as a singing host and black sausage baron, will be present for a while under the gutters.
In Dornhan he has already appeared at the Christmas market and at the fool's guild.
On Sunday the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for early kicking, from 2 p.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the festival.
The Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf kicks off on Friday.
Other programme items include the old-timer and tug-traffic meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the maize maze maze, the crafts market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncing castle, tractor ride (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diets require plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with plant cream is, for example, a quarrel set.
The Association of Vegetarians calls it World Vegan Day on November 1.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Association proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, let yogurt be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oats, almond or rice milk can be used.
Supercharged plant cream replace conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple mustard or a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loosely become doughs instead of eggs, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany are currently vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, students from the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we headed straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which makes a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city doesn't sleep" the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite shutdown, on the second day the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of September 11.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373-meter-high observation deck of the Empire State Building, while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, the bustle of the New York streets went over the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which was an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience everyday life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on Hülsbergstraße.
According to legend, St. Hubertus was a rather reckless hunter who converted by a vision and was later appointed bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn blower group of the hunting riders Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth performs on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood of Es) after old, originally French melodies.
The winds wear riding clothing because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog flocks on tow hunts musically.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed storage room shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One who wants to make the name a program.
According to the Encyclopaedia, Déjá Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit of the café of the same name at the storage in the district town of Kleve in sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to remain with the pure Déja Vu feeling.
After all, the café with its beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only mindful, but also tangible.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at the storage 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually cooked fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the tasty café: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the store, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
“We don’t have a specific target group,” Daniel Büttner said.
Rather, the two want to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of an Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is a cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette for that - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
There were two events already in the bright cafe.
Better said, one.
Because the harbour festival took place outside - the Café Déjá Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the wrestling night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds said.
But not everyone's thing.
Daniel Büttner may not be a big fan of event evenings: “You can’t do it right to everyone.”
And with an event I always address only those who are also interested in the special event.
This is why events will be the exception for us.
“We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible.”
That is to say, Déjá Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the storage in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many stickers, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the Gastromeiles and thus also the Café Déja Vu for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had gladly come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness in the spirit of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the right festivity to perform honours.
This time, writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"Not only did you write a lot for us, but you also did so many rounds for us, for that we thank you very much", says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was scored by Artur Brückner.
A special thank you was addressed to the team of club owner Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again conjured up a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choral rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. in the club hall.
"New voices of singing pleasure are welcome at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for Poverty Reduction announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Development Goals.
They have been included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
At the summit, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am pleased that the member states have agreed to begin a process to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not spare any effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Although the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, there is still a good mood in the handball league.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about this.
Everyone is fully motivated on the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't even know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third league reserve from Fredenbeck has not torn out any trees at the moment, Malmon raises his pointing finger in advance.
I’ve trained a lot of players in A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it has to be seen whether there is still reinforcement from the first," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase in comparison to previous appearances.
Especially in the cover work and in the switching game, it finally failed enormously.
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be improved.
So I hope my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to voice cries of peace in a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
For fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a t-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
For the past two weeks, there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the peace treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict, but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
A lot is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal warehouses in the northwest could bring in more than $50 billion in investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamos spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a “loser” who wants “to use all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
However, concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations, seriously,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are colliding their heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them is good at negotiating and none is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for election reforms, has already said she will boycott the local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a sickening movement to obtain concessions and financial perks from the government.
Renamo’s electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Mozambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has made disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port that mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga replied cautiously to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
The instability has increased the frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, sluggish progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal force has no chance against clever tricks," and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
However, many of the myths are “far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that for authors and teachers who are “excessively didactic,” children would be “completely shut down” because in entertaining stories, the messages would be “subliminal.”
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, stated: “You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminal, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved to his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years came to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From the arrival to the awarding of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed a entertaining piece that received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explaining contexts and bridging time jumps from youth to approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob comes home to his children's heavens, to his courtyard.
And then began the scene game, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the great son of the city.
He drove in style with the two-span and "Black Forest Foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood the role of the sister incredibly well and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honor of being an honorary citizen, who, in representation of the then incumbent Hättich, made his appearance together with a part of the city council.
Afterwards, the three-king singer, who led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Oh, how beautiful, there will come to life again youth memories of my own three-king period."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the courtyard as well as the storks day children with their loud "Out, Out".
At the time, Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church in the same way as he had expressed his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the home ground, behind his burial chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
“A restless mind had finally found its calm and had gone home forever,” it said at the end of the scene.
A lot of applause and a lot of praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of remaining in the league of the athletically descended Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers waives an application for a possible retreat.
"We will not participate in the wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, a first breathing was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
“We have not dealt with the wildcard procedure as long as it is not clear that Düsseldorf will not be granted a license,” Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until 23 May, Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration tribunal and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
So far, however, the Rhinelands have been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The Church of the Lord’s Supper
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office dedicates the last of this year’s public theme tours to the Holy Communion Church on Sunday, October 27.
After the visit to the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning end is a visit to the Church of the Lord’s Supper.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also has a view of the sacrament painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the other half-hour guided tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomkeller-Museum.
Tickets are available at the counter of the Atomic Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
The former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spy affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, citing unspecified circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, it said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency said.
Because Germany is an ally of the US, Snowden threatens extradition there, it said.
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams competed for the winning title at the clubs' tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team, each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, she was supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites, Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, were at the same time as Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
Second place came the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the team Asphaltriecher.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful end of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Open-Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in children’s hands.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24th and 25th August, as part of the summer holiday programme to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous participation campaigns and events.
“Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days,” says the press release.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, there is something for every age.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 am to 5 pm.
The museum workshop is also handicrafted.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or gyros, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
You can also enjoy the many old games, such as wheelbarrow racing or stilt running.
Speed and coordination are required.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 o’clock each.
On a walking tour the children have to guess which stories are true or lie.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who drives his scraper snack with the museum guests from 11 am.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is doing it in a cosy and fairy-tale way.
The storyteller takes the young guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 p.m.
In addition, the children’s costume dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker will be able to look over the shoulder during their traditional work on both days of the event from 11 am to 5 pm.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday programme.
In a small New Zealand town Burt Muro is considered a lovable Kauz because he has set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart defect, is unable to get rid of his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers to Los Angeles by ship.
After the film, there is coffee, tea and cake.
Squeaky beeps disturb residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the warehouse.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue tray bulkers and reloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the transhipment equipment, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the case of an unfavorable wind, this is unfortunately widely heard - and so there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the affected persons, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, they are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to focus on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre-deep bed trough before the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here.
“This year, we want to crack the 3 million tons mark on the envelope,” Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the imported coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If the GDF Suez power plant goes on the grid, a good 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could create up to 10 million.
Bayern basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
“No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years,” Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: There is also basketball in Munich!
At their third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichs sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point gap into a lead 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus gave the game another turn.
"We fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then we made reckless mistakes again," Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our achievements, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were Munich’s most successful pitchers, who had won the first two games against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title winner Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conferencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has been expanded, as has been the case at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until at some point they were too well known to perform at a club,” Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy benefit event for army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians who participate in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became acquainted with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slippery fantasy football series “The League” on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast both on Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series “Marcel the Shell with Shoes On”.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alleyway between two buildings and thinks, 'Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.'
Iran satisfied with nuclear negotiation process
Iran shows itself satisfied with the negotiation process a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
“After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of the last years,” Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that both sides will come to a solution in the end.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Kill Game Camera With Machete
Two children admitted the murder of an 11-year-old boy in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go on bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well, the newspaper "El Pa's" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they would have played football in front of their homes in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the youngster who had taken her was supposed to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the incident in front of the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
One of the reasons for this was the rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily taken to a psychiatric youth hospital.
The pimp must go to jail
For exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a process agreement.
In five cases, he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the line after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the revenues of the women, some of whom he had been acquiring for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he undermines women’s contacts with the outside world.
Along with a colleague who taught the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them monitored in part to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he suffered a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan were killed in an explosion alongside him.
After a psychiatric expert expressed great doubts about the mental disability and thus limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four further cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified after a first notification by telephone surveillance measures.
The interrogated conversations were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered bruises all over the body, has made no statement to this day.
It is "a completely broken personality" who considers violence and exploitation in this metric to be normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He left these circles and wanted to lead a normal life after he was detained," he said.
Oil price continues to drop to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel late morning in Europe in electronic commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday there was evidence of stronger demand due to two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery in China’s economy, which had grown to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell at the ICE Exchange in London by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel.
Court blocks decision on NYPD’s stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court in the U.S. blocked a judge’s order on Thursday calling for changes to the New York Police Department’s Stop-and-Frisk program (“Stop and Search”), and cleared the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals stated that judge Shira Scheindlin’s decisions would be suspended until the city’s appeal was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the stopping and questioning program was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a surveillance body to assist the police in amending its policy and the corresponding training program.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be released from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. judges by deciding that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge had ruled police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted inappropriately black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
She appointed an external body to oversee the implementation of major changes, including policy reform, training and service oversight, and commissioned a pilot program of body-wearing cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were fired after a police check.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this type have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 during the term of mayor Michael Bloomberg, most of whom were black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed a lawsuit, which developed into a class action.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police bureaucracies use the scheme.
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; nor would money be wasted and not solve the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the stop-and-frisk practice that was constitutional, but only reforming the way the NYPD implements the controls.
The Happiness of Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels can achieve
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first chairman, Henne, reported extensively on the work of the association.
He himself was in 2004 for the first time in Mauritania at the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, a further cooperation developed, and the gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the stakes were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the above-mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and is now planning to act as a consultant to the association, according to Henne.
In 2008, in the record time of just under a week, the carpentry company Schleh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a misery district on the outskirts of the capital - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the birth clinic in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, for example, deceleration against burnout.
Due to the political turmoil in the country, it was not possible to make as many trips as planned, but for this, many doctors came to Germany to host here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical devices, medicines, dressing materials, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the club, during their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motivations he mentioned his work in the field of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also demands global love for people.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson Used Phone Hacking to Check a Tips
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair with then-Minister of the Interior Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court in the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack and track Pawlby’s voicemails, but Coulson also called them and left messages, as the court learned.
"According to the public prosecutor's opinion, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is not someone who stands in front of people's homes and hopes to catch them on their own, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis said.
He said NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumors of an affair with Clarke were first picked up by NotW's feature editor when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band of voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
The investigators also found entries on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
During the search, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby’s movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson sent her a voicemail with the following message: “I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett for an affair with a married woman when he himself had been dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest of the planned wealth tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
An arbitration meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed arbitration meeting.
President Francois Hollande received representatives of the associations and associations in the Paris Elysée Palace on Thursday and listened to their complaints.
But he refused to spare the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country should pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained tough.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The match days scheduled between 29 November and 2 December in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus cancelled.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents early in the planning process," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens' information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to be explained the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to introduce ideas.
Häußler made it clear: “The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council.”
The flooding that hit Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was a significant event that raised the question of safeguards for the future, Häußler said.
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
“Protecting as many land as possible is the goal,” Häußler said.
The planning of protection against a flood is statistically planned every 100 years, according to the German weather service.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15 percent surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1,000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," Häußler said.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aClimate, about four million euros have to be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality can expect to receive state subsidies of around 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
The community is dependent on the participation of its citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented last week in the municipal council (we reported) local measures in the influx of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, expert planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that the interaction of all the proposed measures is necessary in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, it is expected to find the most economical solution, according to Joachim Wald von Wald und Corbe.
Discontent prevailed among residents of the old town, who, even in normal thunderstorms, suffer repeatedly from congestion of the canal network.
The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the canal network in such a way that two- to three-year rain events could be coped with.
Dimensioning the sewers larger would devour millions.
Severe injuries after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstraße 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could not say much about the accident at first.
However, there are several witness statements that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so severely jammed that it took the fire brigade almost half an hour to get her out of the vehicle wreck.
The cause of the accident was initially not clear.
Both of them died in nearby hospitals.
The route was closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysicist, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Surprisingly, the relatives in the exterior: the prickly eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet, who is quite true in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two thousand one.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security delusion and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had God’s experiences, his late books read like a mixture of John’s revelation and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He realized early on that the computers were divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "Minderness Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime", which is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick’s world, which is frighteningly similar to ours, mutants are looking to the future – and the police are catching up.
“We are investigating individuals who have not violated any law,” says the head of the agency.
"We'll take them before they can commit a violent crime."
And: "There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a prison camp full of pesudovers."
They assume that bad things happen and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick’s narrative acts like the blueprint for the NSA’s anti-terrorism laws and the eavesdropping rush.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is spinning.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only accepts mistakes and sacrifices, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth.
Reports about Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the US spy affair around Chancellor Angela Merkel in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor’s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier yesterday, Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA Disclosures Strengthen Company Paranoia Over State Surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, the financial capital of Germany.
At the instruction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German internal intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a discussion between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, once again insisted in September that the U.S. would not use foreign espionage opportunities to “steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the former whistleblower, began publishing his horn of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure if they can take the director to the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new high because of state surveillance.
The barrel overflowed with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been messed up, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then management is certainly a potential target.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there has been no evidence so far that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and internet capabilities and that it should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn’t have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the U.S. espionage agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to local jurisdiction and therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about US data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s deputy managing director, said: “We’re seeing a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it’s: Where is my data stored and can you guarantee that they stay physically in that jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore need to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It has been an issue for many years and has not changed fundamentally as a result of the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Business management does not usually boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been fooled into the fact that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or unguarded lying down of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as listening devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized businesses remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in February, the U.S. National Intelligence Estimates ranked France, Russia, and Israel behind China in second place among the countries used to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, spy on their allies.”
Hechingen: Fair answers wedding questions
“Marriage is the most important voyage of discovery that man can make,” said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how to at least succeed in the wedding ceremony have now been given a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
They were important providers for a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has taken off again.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is a must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the dresses, which are often ruffled and embroidered, are closed, often with a veil, but at the back they go down their backs and often end in a tow.
However, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes, the ghosts separate from the fashion house Kleidermüller.
For men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but you can also choose cream colored or brown combinations.
The choice of the venue is important, he said.
Jewelless side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here the domain drew attention to its own offer in the draw.
Whoever wants to drive with the carriage, has an offer for your link.
“Cuts are also popular for young celebrity farewells,” he says.
Romanticism is also required for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" - that is, recording series at special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented at the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding board, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog friends successful
Once again, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally-obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his bitch Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he made it with 87 points to 12th place.
Susi Höpp faced the critical gaze of the judge with her Woody in Class 1.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager’s parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family’s lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the stand in the school gym.
Sheriff of Lowndes County’s investigative officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but that doubts the 17-year-old’s family.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, Kenneth’s and Jacquelyn Johnson’s lawyer, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he had died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics and common sense," Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Her son went to school to learn and came back in the corpse bag,” he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson’s death, as a number of important questions remain unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death attributable to a crime?
Moore said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggests that Johnson died of “positional suffocation.”
However, a second autopsy has resulted in another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will commission the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s authority was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered on Wednesday that authorities release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed.
The teen’s parents said they hoped the video recordings contained clues about how he died.
CDC Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies to teachers and staff, and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the EpiPen auto-injection is most commonly used – to cope with a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed the regulations so schools can keep epinephrine in stock more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something is pressing on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair on it," or "My tongue is tingling."
Parents of intersex children can choose 'gender indefinitely'
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with unambiguous genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to explain gender to such children, but can indicate “indeterminate” or “not fixed” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take away the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make overhaul decisions regarding operations for gender allocation in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC, “I am neither man nor woman.”
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is not born as a boy or as a girl each year.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that is diagnosed with “sexual differentiation disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. recommend using the best available information on gender allocation if determination is not possible, and not waiting for the child’s psychological and physical development before opting for surgery, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but for most children, that’s not the case,” he said.
You can make a gender allocation without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related but due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the level of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys who do not match the gender picture now have a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "genderless" person after a court granted the lifelong retention of an "undefined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, stating: “If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two other pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn baby from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Parenthood is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your own child," she told the parents' website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine saw gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of surgery are questioned, as it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors may also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex they are assigned.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unambiguous genitalia stems from Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender is malleable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental impulses – how parents raise a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, shaping whether a person considers himself male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as “John/Joan”, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a botched circumcision to completely castrate the child and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it wasn't," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to male sex and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sexual surgeries have come to the public, who are “not happy with the outcome.”
Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law can “encourage stamping and stigmatization.”
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a 'not fixed' to the child," she said.
We fear that this will benefit interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will affect us, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be recognized as a third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender,” she said.
The German law is about the assignment at birth.
This is not a struggle that young children should be forced into at this time.
When you grow up, you can decide your own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a support group, says the German law “empowers” both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz’s daughter, was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist.
Although she is barren, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents room so they don’t have to make decisions in a hurry,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write "male" or "female".
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love him.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don’t have to do an operation in a hurry that can’t be reversed.
“This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents because they think they’re not doing the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Unknown injure girls by shooting out of car
Unknown people have injured a 12-year-old in a car shot in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was easily injured on the left calf.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A slice broke.
Then they drove away.
The criminal investigation was carried out on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were called only twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in good time and immediately removed the egg residue, no material damage should have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvesterböller were probably also ignited in the city area, but here too no material damage has been caused.
A resident in Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found his wheel trims in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to act further.
Living with a Future Perspective
Waltraud Ries actually lives dreamy.
Her house is in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes by public transport.
"Hopefully you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spider phobia, but the worry that in old age the many stairs to the house and in the apartment can no longer cope, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties has had to experience on their own what it means to move from floor to floor with disabilities.
Recently, a book by her was published on the topic 'Happy living in old age - which form of living is the best for me?'.
“Our apartment is the best example of what can’t be done in old age,” she begins.
When she moved to the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the countryside.
At the age of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deals with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most of them push it out as long as they can.
Only the others are getting old,” she says with a smile.
It is only when the suffering pressure is really great that you worry.
“It may be too late,” Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer introduces 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
"Whatever form of living you choose is always an individual decision," she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can get sick.
And: 'Without a good knowledge of the national language, you can also unite in the Dolce Vita,' says the book author.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of living or the often cited pensioner WG.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and quirks
'For me, such a community would be but nothing,' she says with a wink.
Not at all like in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'At age you just need your retreat rooms', so Ries.
The author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior living community can still work.
But that would have to be different than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want to rest,” she believes.
With this opinion, at least in the state capital, it is not alone.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible', is the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the state capital.
Your department advises people on the topic of 'ageing'.
That is why older people would often also accept inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends all those who deal with the age-appropriate remodeling of their house or apartment, first of all to thoroughly inform themselves and not to hire the first craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up.
But it is not always possible to remodel the existing apartment in an age-appropriate and thus barrier-free manner, even if it is still beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the also paved path to the apartment door would be the much bigger obstacle.
She will keep searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it arouses her more than before the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. to continue prosecuting Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He is also accused of illicitly passing on secret information.
Therefore, he must face a criminal trial in the US, spokeswoman for the US State Department, Jennifer Psaki, said in Washington.
Snowden’s recent comments would not change that either.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele’s statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German member of the government.
Intelligence detective Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the US in an unaddressed letter, which the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Bundestag and the Federal Prosecutor General.
Following a translation by Ströbele, the text of the letter is as follows:
To the Competent
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, and I used to work as a contractor or as a direct technical expert with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of my government, which caused me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I faced a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also senior officials – including the United States – have judged the revelations of a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations entailed many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the formerly covert misuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks involved have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been proven to be positive, my government still treats dissent as a breach of fidelity and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will abandon this detrimental attitude.
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible investigation of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.

Kindergarten has found a private buyer
“The building is in good hands,” says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße has been sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the municipal council at its recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
“The community is satisfied,” Maier said.
There was $100,000 in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking for the garden and clearing the walkway.
“This effort is now gone,” Maier says.
Place concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a place concert on the terrace of the inn Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the baton at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Approximately 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully cope with the first musician shock.
Obama Campaign Considers Replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported on Thursday night that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011” to find out if it would look better for Obama’s dwindling hope of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, National Political Correspondent of the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the campaign’s leading employees and the White House’s efforts, namely to measure the effect it has on the poll scores of ex-Executive Secretary Clinton’s exchange for Vice President Bill Daley.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
“Double Down” claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her “close personal relationship” before finally opting for such a move after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a lot of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had terrible poll values at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley described the investigations as “due care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that significant effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out if such a move would pay off in terms of ballot boxes.
“Campagnes don’t spend so much money on polls and focus groups unless you seriously think about something,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he had asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said he did not think the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama didn’t know whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
What happens to my email on the go?
Email is actually an electronic letter.
Was e-mail technically implemented in the design of the Internet service similar to the traditional mail?
In the conception of the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account to provide a stable foundation for a hearing-proof correspondence.
Therefore, a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The email program or browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step.
For example, if you have a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the track, the mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Are traditional emails read along the way?
Most e-mails are read several times by software robots on the go.
The sender's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place contextual advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can show appropriate links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read emails?
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal scrutiny actions.
Is it possible to protect emails from reading?
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading along.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to easily recognize who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the e-mail market in Germany?
According to a August 2013 study by Convios Consulting, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes.
While Yahoo Mail’s shares had fallen recently, Google’s GMail was able to grow significantly.
Mother in the forest disguised and retired
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburg citizen buried his dead mother in the woods after police investigations.
At first, he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he dropped the money for more than a year and a half.
Now, the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: At that time, it was noticed that no medicines were needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officers, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy showed no evidence of a capital crime.
Want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a shining treat.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, which raises the pH in the protein and triggers the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and glows – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice lights up.
We’ve tested it over the past few months and it seemed ideal to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his new creation will be even more ambitious.
He says, “I would like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is impossible in and of itself because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we can find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
TSV Morsum is still in the handball league after six days of playing.
The team of Ingo Ehlers will be in the derby tomorrow against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts again for us.
“I hope we finally have our heads free,” Ehlers says optimistically.
He finally has his entire squad at his disposal, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Like us, Daverden also relies on speed play.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
In the first place, however, it is important to increase in coverage, which has left everything but a sure impression.
Daverden coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re not the favorite yet, because in the derby everything can always happen.
However, Panitz now wants to go to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-Youth Joost Windßuß, who is active with double play rights at the A-Youth Bundesliga HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
If you are not hot in a game like this, stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I became a Halloween mug.
For the past two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and will probably not do so this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Retailers’ Association (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inciting inanimate objects are the last cry.
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most sought after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there is nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and weren’t alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
That’s a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not stinky.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, who move through the neighborhoods with the saying “sweet or acids.”
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not be fooled – eat.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugary candy corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Confederation of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it spooks.
They have great names like “Terror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “Howl-O-Scream” and “The House of Shock”.
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, America Haunts says, and that includes the wonderful photos you’re peeing in your pants and then putting your friends on Facebook where you won’t get rid of them again, and then the guy you’re standing on leaves you with a comment like “nice facial expression.”
But let’s finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from childhood on.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, is believed to come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Housing fire in Helmbrechts: rescuers mountain charred corpse
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire on Friday night.
Rescuers are hiding a charred body from the house.
Rescuers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
It burned on the ground floor of the house late Thursday evening.
When the fire brigade arrived, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The soldiers went to the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible lack of pastors: The Evangelisch-Lutherische Landeskirche Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in a conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routines yourself.
With Burfien, the Landeskirche has for the first time commissioned a full-time pastor to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churching: “God’s voice is silent, the world is noisy.”
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my schedule and I can focus where I care.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly more will be paid in the free economy, but for that theologians would have a safe employer.
This is up to today’s young people, who are not only concerned with careers, but also with meaningful work.
According to the Landeskirche, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree start their vicariate.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy positions in the future.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology offers a broad education.
You can even become federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible path to world-class events.
We are excited to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be a fun championship.
In addition, there is a training and test day in February at the Defender Challenge as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Fire brigade called to rescue a dog that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock outcrop in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her miserable situation.
Firefighters sailed off on rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death
The fire brigade managed to bring a dog into safety, which was stuck on a 15-meter-high protrusion in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service firefighters.
They had desperately searched for her missing bitch and posted calls for help on social networks when she had escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 on Wednesday, a walker running his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-meter-high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed to the spot and sailed off to save Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical rescue specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She ate a couple of dog cakes.
It was a rather unusual task.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, the technical rescue team specialist, said: “Ruby was very lucky.”
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, “Looking at the rescue was frightening.”
I couldn’t believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in her arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and she had collapsed, she would probably have crashed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, “We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can hardly believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she had worked as a background singer on Jagger’s 2004 song “Old Habits Die Hard.”
Perry said she ate dinner with the old rocker and that “he dredged me when I was 18.
She added, “It’s been a long time and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denies that he has ever made attempts at rapprochement with Katy Perry.”
He added, “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" landed at number one this week.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots a choice
A new day, a new frightening story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire-secured border along the Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the potential economic benefits that more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe would bring, but this was not – as expected – in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favorable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance with Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots.
Not really a story.
And one that has come so far that it’s already like a fossil: The first time I heard the “independence means passport control” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the European project officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party Alternative for Germany – founded just this year – was able to gain almost five million votes in the Bundestag election in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Due to the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket into which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the common currency, many people believe that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deepening European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives adopted by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a debilitating cost drawback, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All the wage statements in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is looming, especially in France, the EU’s former cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be kept in check and Paris could be equated with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe’s own economic policy, with which the depressed French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive after-election, placing the ruling socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can choose to be a region of (finally) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could do well in a more relaxed European context if we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to then get an austerity policy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age mates, research shows.
Physical changes do not directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter already grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually that’s not a sign that puberty is fast,” Kaplowitz explained.
Apparent indications of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, as well as body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Nevertheless, there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it will take at least two to three years to reach menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test as puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is “early ripe” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If progress is faster, tests by an endocronologist may be indicated so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defending against another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medications, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings of being unlike their age mates.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her days at ten.
Even though there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school terrified and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causative.
Boys come into puberty similar to girls.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported conducting a 2001 study on girls between the ages of six and nine, which links body fat to entering puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age mates.
There are different explanations for this.
Global seems to be an early puberty influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and pubic hair grows earlier, the trend towards a full-blown earlier puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is widespread even in babies and young children.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who blossom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always the ones that airlines strive for the most, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims made on Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.’s latest aircraft.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. arch rival Boeing says the airlines should decide.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “mini-jumbo” design is supposed to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized “777X” holds 406 people at tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Airplane giants often share blows about technical details through advertising in the specialist press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed donors a picture of three people sitting squeezed together in a restaurant, with the title, “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are tighter than regional turboprops,” said Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Leahy.
With changing dietary habits, people are getting fatter, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the average male American between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a 1950s seating concept when the average body size of the newly christened "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have been carried out to show that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus’ figures on seat sizes and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between fares and facilities.
The company also explains that according to research, the experience on the plane depends on more than the seat width.
“It really means giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to succeed,” said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers it is increasingly an issue that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion according to list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their newest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X, with its ten seats per row, is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than for machines currently in use with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products,” says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full ten-seat cabins per row with existing 777s suggested that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offering is driven by the threat of the 777,” says Mary Kirby, cabin facility expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-travelling jet sellers even carry tape measure to measure the setup in the competition.
Even if they promote comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly compacted design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call for a new industry standard is likely to blow up, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could End the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Tests on humans will require more trials, which may take a few years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to quit and tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information needed to produce nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to experience no nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a “time-out,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is quite certain, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, smokers would use it to quit.
“They then know that when they start smoking again, they don’t enjoy the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to quit the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the findings were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Joe Tripodi, the former Labor Party minister from New South Wales, is being investigated by the state corruption regulator.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the Maritime lease regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert investments in three properties on state-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend lease agreements at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a call for tender after their expiration in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated on the charge that Tripodi had known of Obeid's covert interest in the plots after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole announced it on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for leases.
The tenants were opposed and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for the companies on Circular Quay, which earned the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as Minister of the Port from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally supported public tenders.
But he declined to make the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a change in the government's leases.
A phone record presented to the ICAC showed conversations between August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Department after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
“Was the topic discussed in these phone calls the elaboration of the commercial lease arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” replied Tripodi.
I don’t remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn’t.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter planes attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to ‘truth test’
The government is considering a "real-life test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used on a criterion that prevents the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the move of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was released after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments about foreign workers because they could be viewed as an insult by Australia’s neighbors.
“Sounding statements such as ‘foreigners should stand behind’ and ‘Australians should stand first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions demanded a protected labor market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region take an echo of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The proposal outlines twelve measures once proposed by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on human trafficking, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "truth criterion" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be verified as to whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally associated with the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island on a refugee boat this week.
The troubled nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father’s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
HS2 Ltd's work proposes to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England from the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain closer together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the London-Northern England high-speed road from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has hired HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.”
We’re moving forward with HS2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to “unambiguously” campaign for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
That’s why we are delighted to work as a partner of the British government and explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and deciding together on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at takeoff and landing despite efforts in the US to ease the regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, as long as they are in “flight mode.”
Passengers are already allowed to do so during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian companies are observing the decision that U.S. airlines have to carry out tons of work, but are not pursuing any immediate plans to change their regulations.
The air traffic control agency CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"CASA does not currently have any specific rules on the use of electronic equipment on aircraft," it said.
The issue is subject to regulations that require airlines to maintain security at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin staff.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about an extension of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, stating that they are open to change, but these should be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would stay with the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices may not be used at launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has different impacts on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate mobile interference, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers, and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended to store heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
In front of the district bye against Schalke had travelled BVB trailers with light rockets for ugly scenes in the Veltins arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before the Friday match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - at first.
It was an unfamiliar, almost ghostly acoustic, which was offered to the viewer until just before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were heard with their songs.
The southern stand, on the other hand, where the most loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no songs, no battle shouts.
The platform of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint encouragement, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the stand, a large flag with the inscription "Section ban" was blowing lonely.
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller entered the court as always as the first BVB player, brief jubilation burned up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south stand.
Even that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a festive mood.
It was only five minutes before the start that the capo climbed its pedestal - and the tension, which until then could be felt by hands, was released in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
As always, it was the turn of the south stand - and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was again here.
And at the latest when the loud invitation "Derby winner stands up" came out with a whistle from the south stand, everything was again as always.
The silence was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the spectator’s ranks and onto the pitch – and in the process almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller hit.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke forbade the Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I banned it,” he said.
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various options for punishment - by Tuesday they now have time to opt for one.
Otherwise, Watzke said, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of next week.
“It’s going to be a big deal,” Watzke said.
I can’t wait to see how the reactions in the south are going.
Pfandhäuser are booming in Singapore as the middle class crisis has arrived
At a pawn shop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping center, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, ring and pair of earrings to pay for her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money in it,” Amirthalinga says.
Although she earns $3,000 a month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not sufficient, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so high that ValueMax, where it traded, became the third pawnhouse listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Bounding jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Singapore pledges charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just over the 15.4 percent that United Overseas Bank demands, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn houses offer the advantage that there is no need to verify the creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible faster than at banks.
This is why millions of people in the region turn to pawn houses after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes are looking for liens to offset the difference in stuttering economies.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor’s described growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in Asia compared to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decrease in consumer demand.
“Ultimately, in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have further intensified the trend towards pledging personal items as people take the opportunity to turn the family’s jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city’s 200 pawn houses are gold.
People say to themselves, "The gold price looks good, let's pledge grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai pawnhouse operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the pledge business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore, want to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside of Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the $66 million it took this week with the Singapore IPO.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawn houses not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase the debt.
“Customers borrow items they already own, and liquefying personal valuables does not increase household spending,” she explains.
The pawn lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use pawn loans are in financial trouble.
Rich Singaporeans also come to ValueMax stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, earning them up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all social backgrounds come to us.
“These include wealthy people who borrow for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who have to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany clear up the increasingly explosive NSA espionage affair.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Party, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify at a German public prosecutor’s office or before an investigative committee.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the $325 million Australian health bailout to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “immediate measures” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency election assistance.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic procedures and treatments for gray star, are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day care clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up care after hospital stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinicians have told me they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health care system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive funds from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they weren’t accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health care system on a more sustainable course.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to taking the state’s public health system off the worries list,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these election performances will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today’s announcement is only a “pave solution”.
“We are in the current situation because the laboratory government has withdrawn $430 million from the healthcare system,” he told ABC TV.
It can’t be that a state government pulls nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and puts 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretends to be good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier cost than necessary.
The plot, set in France in the 1760s, tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
As she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of one extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips away in lust or sensationalism – and that’s what its problem is.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a torturer's shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a surveillance group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition manufacturing facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group said on Thursday, while severe clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are allegedly stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date on
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization set up Damascus to destroy or make all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities “unoperable,” including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
It is believed that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and deposits, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to be 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting against the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not mention any details.
The fighting underscores the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors as their mission to free Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is now convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has witnessed their destruction.
Therefore, “no further inspection activities are planned at the moment.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 sites listed by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites were “resigned ... and the chemical weapons program’s objects there have been relocated to other listed facilities that have been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take the hat off the bravery and courage you all showed in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director General of the Surveillance Organization, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting against Assad’s government and its security forces, many of which are members of the Alawites, in this civil war to secede Shia Islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Wrath over Bali bombers' verdict
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted indignantly to the verdict for the last of the instigators who were brought to justice as Umar Patek was supposed to be legally shot.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most sought after persons, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosive devices for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many more.
A number of terrorist-related charges were also indicted, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even though it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also referred to as “Demolition Man” because of his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation inflicted by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
“You should put him in front of a shooting squad,” Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with it every day that I will not have another grandson and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub on October 12, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had a explosive-filled backpack exploded.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and “died” three times while hanging on a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the massacre and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there’s no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds isn’t much.
Patek is the last Bali bomber to go to court.
He withdrew almost a decade from arrest, but was eventually captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just under four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t stand up,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict was given before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year, which is being committed with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in airplanes (but do not have cell phone calls)
Air passengers can now use their electronic devices from departure to landing to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not make phone calls, according to the new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they will be implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight personnel and the regulations for the stowage of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to restart until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
Upon arrival, passengers must turn them off again and must not start them again before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even during take-off, landing and on the rolling field, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional flight attendant association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
To be honest, we’re sorry to have to feel like watchers on this issue.
Internet connections for browsing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers were still prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends,” the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to publicly leave a American Airlines jet for refusing to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops still need to be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also interfere with transmitting masts,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies say that up to one-third of passengers forget or ignore to turn off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air passengers in 1966, after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication devices by VHF radios carried by passengers became known, which at the time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the flight height is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-readers only emit minimal radiation when you turn around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
One of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and took a test flight to identify problems, but couldn't find any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the disruption was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots calling for disruption of aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended to the FAA to allow pilots to order the disconnection of the equipment by the passengers in case of instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travelers who today would be extensively equipped with technology.
“We are delighted that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not inconsistent with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drilling island released again
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water raft was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was patched up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA at its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said, “This water raft was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island.
He added: “He couldn’t fly any further, so we were contacted with the request for help.”
When she was released, the water bowl was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders, representing roughly the sizes, sectors and regions of the UK.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while countries in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favor new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than the long and strenuous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When asked about certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, as companies say that the costs of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the one that is traditionally the most European-friendly.
Ultimately, and this probably says the most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority want Britain to change the deal, and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This realization, found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will bring the heft of action back to the UK.
It’s about a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion at 16 percent in favor of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means for companies an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller calls Bulgaria’s pipeline the beginning of a new gas era
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom Board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to provide more diversity on Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe, raises the risk of conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated “forever.”
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct, and the financing options are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
This was highlighted by Christian Ulbrich, CEO of Jones Lang LaSalle Europe, Middle East and Africa, on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
As sought after German commercial real estate, the view on the transaction volume shows, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the same period last year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive rate of interest," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees charged with allegations against Jonathan Lord of sexual offences
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child sexual offences before accusations were filed against Caringbah-based nurse Jonathan Lord in 2011, according to the Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse.
However, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it had “never been involved in an incident of child sexual abuse in the organization.”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher was convicted of abuse of children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission’s assistant lawyers, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety".
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management had failed “from me downwards” in hiring Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety policies.
Lord was convicted of sexual offences against twelve boys earlier this year during his two-year job for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
However, Hare denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented employees from reporting Lord’s breaches of children’s safety.
Staff said they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, taking care of them privately as babysitters, letting them sit on his lap, telling one he loved it, and letting kids play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord, who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord's supervisor at YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very unapproachable."
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, which is why they did not report him.
Hare said he had communicated his view to the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson the organization had to learn from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was “not reporting” by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign confidentiality commitments shortly after the allegations occurred was made by YMCA’s Chief Children’s Services Officer, Liam Whitley.
He said this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but this has been “overzealous” and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children during the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" in hiring, reviewing, training, training and oversight of employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his retirement from office, the 59-year-old expressed his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, mostly limiting his comments to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Middle East Peacekeeper Quartet.
Asked if he would like to return to the office of prime minister, Blair was quoted by Evening Standard from London as saying, “Yes, sure, but it’s unlikely that this will happen, so...”
When the horse show experts gathered in hordes in Cardiff to select the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The shrimp, who isn’t even in kindergarten and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee were running loosely through the three laps and winning the first prize – leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had placed his plate cap at a bold angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony, which were far beyond his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing with Shetland Pony every day ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and went off the pitch with gold cup and rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was like electric, and everyone cheered him up and clapped him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about.
As it started, it won’t be long before it’s on the Horse of the Year show – and I’m sure it will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors assessed Fenton and Toffee by how well they would have beaten and presented in the screening ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes did their part, which really fit perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be 'reformed'
A Chinese newspaper, which had demanded the release of a reporter charged with defamation on the front page, was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports of a state-owned company.
Now, the New Express is undergoing “comprehensive rectification,” the regulator said.
The 'rectification order' was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said it had decided to “impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license.”
“We have also instructed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant leaders be identified at the New Express and immediately review the New Express leadership team.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was out for money and fame.
I realized that I was doing wrong.
Following Chen’s apology, the New Express released an apology on the front page, stating that they had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that banned the authorities from forcing someone to blame themselves.

One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found.
The zigzag tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, authorities said.
According to the court, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were found in the tunnel.
Three men, according to authorities, were charged with possession and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between 10 years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses a challenge to drug cartels as they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a Tijuana residential building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr are set to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out on the breakup of his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was scheduled to air Friday (local time), Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly the way we plan or hope.”
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old emphasized.
"We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream pie, ice cream or a strong Edamer, these gourmets are not on a vegan’s menu.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off all consumption of animal products - even honey is denied.
What remains, you may wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan nutritional world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been living vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the shoe choice," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” Proctor says, according to the vegan maxim, which extends to the entire consumer behavior.
Instead of haunting burgers, scrambled eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
“It’s a double bonus,” says Proctor today, “in fact, being vegan is not a renunciation, not an ascetic, but an enrichment.”
And it is precisely these conditionings that have failed some of the well-intentioned attempts.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that causes many to give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor compares.
He said, “Some tastes are not attached to the beast.”
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For a barbecue, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and a few vegan sausages.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste firmly.
Of course you want to have something between your teeth, that is legitimate.
“It should taste good, but that’s not just to reduce to animal food,” says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the change had a positive aspect.
I don’t take in any other cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood counts are fine, I often get checked," Proctor says.
In particular, many Vegansimus critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing in the pasture, it is questionable whether the amount of vitamin B12 in the meat you buy in the refrigerator is high," says Proctor.
For vegans, it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 values are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go a long way for food procurement.
After all, there are staples everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I find everything I need on site.
I only buy something special from time to time.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is with "ordinary" finished products.
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than generally thought.
"There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few little tricks you can achieve good, if not partly better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecake, Proctor was also able to amaze his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has dynamics, if you cook together, it has a new importance.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” says Proctor.
Of course, he was already skeptical.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions you have to act as a vegan with your fingertips.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor said.
And in more detail, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as it might be - and the vegan does not appear to be as restricted in everyday life as it is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Pommes are everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafels, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he gives way to pasta dishes, or just ordering a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly getting ready for it.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to the people, make them aware of it."
“If enough demands come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu,” he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Mannheim kitchen or Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are the exact opposite of exclusive.
“Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others,” says Proctor.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the outset,” says Proctor.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially when one learns to understand that animal additives can also be contained in peanuts as a coloring agent, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food as well as cleaning agents.
"Sometimes you develop a scanner view and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to, "It's sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingertip that strikes on consciousness.
He may not be able to completely abandon his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the indices of the Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in a week alone.
At first, US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent mass erroneous purchase orders to options markets due to technical problems.
It took the stock exchange operators almost a whole day to see through and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the U.S. came to a halt due to a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq exchange for several hours.
Last year, Facebook’s IPO also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, the SEC later noted and thundered the company to a record fine of $10 million.
Radler kills 63-year-old
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was on his way from the station square to the market place at around 10 p.m. on a ladies’ bike.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped onto the sidewalk from a restaurant, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground and pulled a square wound about 15 centimeters long on his head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police send an extradition notice to Assange
The British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had sent a “prompt to confront” the 40-year-old Australian, calling for him to appear at a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he would be threatened with arrest.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden on charges of a sexual offense after his options under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19 and asked the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard has sent a request to a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time chosen by us,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks.
Driver caught between legs at 210 km/h and hot drink will receive a 1,000-pound penalty
A driver was penalized for driving at a speed of up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
Before the Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a cost of 90 pounds and a victim's surcharge of 100 pounds.
Tax for foreign property owners against London’s speculative bubble
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who had imposed a stamp tax of 7% in the 2012 budget on apartments that cost over 2,000 million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company rather than as individuals.
Earnings from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at 708 million pounds in the fiscal year 2012/13, already exceed revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp tax on high-priced housing and the introduction of associated legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to claim that high-quality real estate is under-taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system.”
“But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying real estate in London, or stop owners from selling,” he added.
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed an even annual growth rate of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%), according to a survey by Savills.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog’s tail swinging and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with their tails were waving more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right brains react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to their species' lateral tail swings, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said, “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog moving the tail to the right (as seen from the perspective of the bubbling dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tendency was primarily to the left (again from the perspective of the dog waving), then their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the swirling with the tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand their pet’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, a dog behavior expert and guest scholar at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a satisfied dog.
Another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada said: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robotic dog when his ‘tail’ is waving on the left and not on the right rather than getting uneasy – just the other way around than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore be that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior can be easily recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys delay appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer has developed laryngeal inflammation.
The band from Sheffield was scheduled to play at the Hydro on Friday.
Due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has to be postponed.
The band’s announcement came after they had previously had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner has been diagnosed with larynx, which is why he unfortunately can’t occur.”
The show will take place at the LG Arena in Birmingham on November 20, which was moved to the Hydro in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience caused by this.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the pope’s election – this is the case for a group of 120 “elective cardinals”.
In a statement that announced the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of electoral cardinals was likely to decrease by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary to make the number of elective cardinals again 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, Valero said.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “possible” for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – it’s all completely new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large towns would be called cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he appoints.”
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair the seat backrest
General Motors recalls nearly 19,000 of its 2014 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a statement from the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Authority on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal vehicle safety guidelines for head restraints.
"If you hit the vehicle from the rear, it's possible that the headrest doesn't properly protect the occupants, so there's an increased risk of injury," the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website said in a statement.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. automaker since the 2009 insolvency-related restructuring.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock increased 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Desperation screams from Obama voters
I voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics
Blockade Policy Doesn't Excuse Obamacare's Website Issues, Drone Attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a sad book.
It is a book that I believed would cheer me up and give me hope again during the bleak second year of my medical studies.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and portrays Barack Obama’s memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient transcripts in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take my breath away from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and news speakers paused to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.
And then I close the book.
To switch back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you were torn from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I voted for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things that Obama has accomplished, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the partisan blockade tactic has tipped too many aspirations that our nation should be pushed forward with: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans and why whistleblowers are being punished who disclose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report saying that the White House’s efforts to shut down the media are the “most aggressive...since the Nixon government.”
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that the government work could be contrary to the previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the MP’s office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to have been largely chosen by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unfinished alternative, he seemed unable to determine his directions and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with Obama’s approval ratings dropping to below 45% this week, the book’s return to 2008 has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to make a serious loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the electoral assistants after the decision, he told his staff they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters get pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining agency, which is in a court dispute over paying $6 million in carbon tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions of whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important in deciding whether to cut or cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes ahead of the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it could proceed faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be held two months after the end of the vote?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have a system where you walk in, enter the data into a computer, choose immediately, and then get the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballots.
Are you using them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Voting with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has reviewed the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, stated that his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously.”
A public office is about public service.
“We strive for no reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, so two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation is rapidly catching up with the alleged manipulations in the currency market.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are collaborating with authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes ownership every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that entails the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it received requests for information from authorities.
“Our investigation on this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been retired from his current position as the European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was retired this week and Matt Gardiner, former chief currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher’s Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it took action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma stated that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks lead to “the ability to influence the market even with very low ticket prices”.
The news came out the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed and cooperated with the competent authorities.
“We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained,” Credit Suisse said.
Painted the fence on the Bechtle property
A group of the citizens' initiative "Swiss meadow" has beautified the building fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and broadened the footpath, a press release said.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the rear part of the property was not allowed for security reasons, because the terrain threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had arranged the embellishment action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens’ initiative much in their action.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against construction ruins".
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city's project will be much better, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is delaying these responses further, the BI says.
As was heard, the mayor’s public remarks also had an impact.
May had said in the municipal council meeting that he fears the exit for the thermal bath, should the population vote in the citizens' decision against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some seem to be frightened because of this, others find it a “plump attempt at blackmail” on the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane kein Schwalbenkönig
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "bulls" from the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of dove kings," he took the two offensive whirlwinders to protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest reason for Rangnick’s criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3-0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which an alleged acting became fatal to the Senegalese – which, of course, was not, as the TV pictures showed.
“A blatant wrong decision,” said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as “completely overwhelmed.”
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He firmly defended his German compatriot: "I would have behaved the same way in every single situation as Roger Schmidt."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
“Because I’m the one who was insulted,” the 46-year-old said.
However, given the success run, Rangnick tuned a hymn of praise.
“There are only two words for this: really good,” he said.
There's not much exposure.
The way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep it that way.
There will hardly be any change in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
“Unless a player comes forward with a desire to leave the club,” Rangnick said.
Supreme Court approves Obama’s health law
It is a great victory for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also reaffirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page law, and also held that the requirement of the Health Act that states either extend Medicaid access requirements or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding was not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 pre-election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian place makes its way to light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century's dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" swarmed Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some of the valley’s inhabitants set up sun loungers, while others put on sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
But this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally adopted the 5 million kroner (around 615,000 euros) project.
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alpine town of Viganella with winter sunshine for several years.
Post hardly learns on Sundays
"Many citizens have not yet noticed that the red dots for Sunday emptying are still on various mailboxes in the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying no longer takes place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP says.
A question from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post office building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld is emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten even Sunday is emptied, will not be answered in the answer to the question of the FDP.
The social and youth spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service.
“This company is radically and unreasonably thinning out despite the price increase for letters in January 2013.”
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and the City Association, supports his group colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that here the emptying times are changed or also cancelled."
The post office is miles away.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Even for the core city, especially not mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier said the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
However, according to his knowledge, there is also a Sunday apprenticeship in Hofheim.
Your party is in favour of privatization.
“Then decisions will be made elsewhere,” Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees should rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
This morning, the city magistrate advises on a presentation by traffic manager Stefan Majer (Green).
The parking charges are to be increased by 50%.
For this, however, the prices should not be raised, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the store is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller dealers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland believes that an increase after two decades is "very appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Schwäbische Alb in the Schiller school gymnasium in Reutlingen.
The Elbers were on the other side of the network with an experienced team.
But soon it turned out that, even due to age, they were not able to keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstädter.
With the hard and placed stops, the Gönninger were extremely hard.
Repeatedly they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly through the middle of the net and were not there for the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstädter in all respects.
In view of this devastating and game-defining performance, the third set was then won slightly lax and lustless at the 3:0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be a much more powerful opponent on the field on November 2 with the TV Baiersbronn, which could clearly prevail in Nagold.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and points gifts, especially when taking the ball; even with the passes, the precision was sometimes lacking and in some critical game scenes, the overzeal prevented the look for possible points wins.
In this highly balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed with the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut open on this day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, Kaiser said, described this area as the highlight of the gorge, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the people present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that Nursing Day was a suitable tool to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature.
At the same time with the tourist aspect, the ecological consideration can also be taken into account.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Freiburg Government Bureau following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-sighted landscape is consistent with the goal of preserving the now-growing old Allmendweide with its specific protected habitat types by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for species preservation.
Tribukait said she would not fail at this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project and the previous care days achieved for the future.
After these different presentations, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in advance, the forest tractor may be available.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was to have a clear view of the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior citizens policy, as well as its own municipalities can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet registered.
The 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been the only candidate for the succession of the no longer-candidate mayor for age reasons.
The application deadline expires on Monday, November 11 at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, filed an avalanche of lawsuits on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outlawed at Nortel’s insolvency auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that had purchased the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements before the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit that hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered $4.4 billion.
After being outlawed by Rockstar on the Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s library of patents.
"Although Google has failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at the auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to do so," the letter said.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google because it claims Google’s patent infringement was intentional, the accusation said.
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the first freely elected president of the country to succeed Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, whose seat is on the Nile and is modelled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Mursi, a U.S.-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been heavily targeted by the respective government since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Mursi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven o’clock local time.
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential splendor of the Mubarak period, traffic was only briefly halted so that the car convoy could cross the usually bustling road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of Islamists, but of all those who wanted to bring the efforts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the target.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mursi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem he listened to in the harbour position.
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds in the largest lecture hall of the university with choirs of "The army and the people are one hand".
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state that had been chased out of office.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not before parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberg discotheque ensures two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday night it is called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker fell from ladder: seriously injured
When a defective external sensor was replaced, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside facade of a inn.
As he climbed on the ladder leaning towards the gutter, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6" to the state hospital Salzburg.
Rape in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana was found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The act caused national horror.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for 14 hours for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial that she had been in a bar with Booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but he denied being responsible for the girl’s death.
Police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from prison because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rapes are almost commonplace in South Africa: there are about 64,000 sexual assault charges per year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark figure for sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker clarifies right at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham are the pigsucks, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the workings of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach out to the microphone.
Jumbo spotted for strengthening at a quick snack in Waldshut
“I’m working huge amounts here,” the TV makers marvel at Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 colognes a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what is important in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at the age of six months.
Television at a level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
“I’m excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then,” Jumbo said cynically.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But it is worth watching anyway.
The spectator sees that the dismantling of the Cologne is still manual work.
Because: Black forest ham is traditionally found without bone on the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing are visually reminiscent of a "submarine".
The trick: fir branches here in the smoke for the special taste of the black forest ham.
20 days in smoke make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc disappears in the jumbo," he announces the test feeding.
“It’s really delicious,” said the TV star.
This will allow everyone involved to live.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its earnings prospects for the full year and expects record income from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before taxes of between $325 and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are reached, that means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
Managing Director Graham Turner announced that Flight Centre generated eight percent profit in the first half of the year and had a strong start to the second half, especially in the Australian and British private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable, and some of them are well on track towards record yearly income before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings bearers.
In Australia, the recreational industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker market for business travel.
It was similarly good for Flight Centre’s leisure business in the UK, while business customers also spent less here.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre’s shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" in order to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will have to take a stand-alone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit regulator, will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a speech this summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our auditing system to restore public trust,” stressing that the GCSEs would become “more challenging, more ambitious and more stringent.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, it is said from coalition circles that the comprehensive math test – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "real-life problems", including financial mathematics.
Attracting beautiful animals and tasty cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color strokes will be presented this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
Evaluations were already made on Thursday.
Once again, the local association W514 organizes this large exhibition.
Breeders of the existing clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals here as well as young Wickeder hobbyists show their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges carried out the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals on the cages is appropriate.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturdays from 10 am and on Sundays from 10 am to 3.30 pm, followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a tombola and a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and performs for the first time with a new baby head.
Pamela's blonde curls have been famous since her role in the television series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the newest star who shocks his fans with a drastic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has separated from her long blonde curls in favor of a platinum blonde short haircut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look on Wednesday in Los Angeles and also snapped a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It’s the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the moral change.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21, in the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on Today's Dealing with the Last Things".
Professor Johanna Rahner is a lecturer.
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical parishes of Salem, the Salem Palace and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how today people classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, and had relied on those images of heaven and hell that "to this day shape our ideas", then the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of perfection would be characterized rather by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
“The greater hope for Christians has been duly driven out by the criticism of religion,” says the speaker.
She has provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks.”
Johanna Rahner continues: “But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death.”
This is the question of the longing that “dreams that in the end everything will be good.”
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as a Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleiner Heuberg reaffirm their creed at the Confirmation
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youth of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
In the morning the group Laudato-Si accompanied the service, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firmlings had prepared for the big feast day in recent months, under the direction of deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous community members.
In different projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race delights participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit over the hill chains around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel of the eventing sports club Illmensee tells us.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, also numerous cyclists who wanted to exercise their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good rankings at the German Championships.
Both were able to get off the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader managed to save a small lead to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
In second place was again Pascal Treubel.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from the team Nightmare, who made it to the top of the winning ladder.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Fahrer from Owingen.
An encouraging development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race there were even more absolute top athletes at the start this year.
Four drivers were able to stand out from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike half-prof from the Black Tusk racing team.
Together with a team-mate, Pangerl has already been world champion in twelve-hour driving twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already has two German championship titles in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was an eyelash strike final in the finish line in front of the three-lake hall.
Pangerl was the first to race over the finish line.
Only a second later, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann came third in the overall standings.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well organized course of the event.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle Brings Free Medical Assistance to Outlying Villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for him as the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father kept losing consciousness and traveled to hospitals that lacked the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but then an inflammation developed that spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is to a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for her, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country’s healthcare spending is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze themselves into minibuses and drive to the villages in need on the roof over unpaved terrain with the constricted medical equipment.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bulge – with its wide smile and limitless energy – is happy to attend the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins examining hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the operation and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It’s a strenuous pace, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then heads back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year, knowing that their work makes a huge difference for the people they help.
One man explained that the free operation of a herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated herniated
“This will change the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who studies medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers in Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in surgery where we help drain blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley explains.
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies with them.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, transport and guidance.
“He’s without a doubt a hero,” says O’Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives and thus fulfilling a promise he gave to his father brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this work,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut to the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his yard, acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago in fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago sits in his chair tired of life, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway tells the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and willpower.
Janson has been on stage for a long time as a solo performer.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the respective active scene: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the feeling of Cuba's life with her songs and her glorious voice.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewage canal from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
Anyone who visits Cologne will not pass by the cathedral.
About 157 meters, the two towers rise to the sky, making it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who admire the two delicate church towers know that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne’s underworld.
The meeting point for his guided tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly on the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: “We start in the underground car park,” says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore only what was not too large remained of the remains of the old city wall.
Most of the users of the car park rush past the Roman remains and only park their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site in Parkdeck D2, separated by metal grid bars.
You can see about five meters high ruins of hand-plate-sized stones.
“It’s the remains of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century AD,” Schulze says.
Before returning to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look into a dark, 15 meters deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the Prätorium, and here the participants descend back into the depths.
We see here the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the pretor of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means "city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinensians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the emperor cult".
And the Prätorium is the former governor’s palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the entrance hall of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman sewage canal, which is preserved here on a length of about 120 meters.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests.
There's still a surprise for Schulze.
After getting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16 meter deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was indispensable for ritual washings.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which the construction work is due to begin shortly.
There will be a few more years until completion.
Leg almost chopped off: New edition of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the Rocker environment is rolled up again after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Regional Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants were silent for the start.
They were supposed to have been active in the rockers scene and then belonged to the bandidos.
The prosecution accuses them of having, together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt, stabbed and beat three men in a car in June 2009.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a senior member from Berlin.
Apparently there was a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about district fighting and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice revoked the verdict after revision of the public prosecutor’s office and referred it back to the regional court for further proceedings.
One of the defendants is currently in open trial for another offense.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes on the night of the crime.
As a witness, the then investigating commissioner was invited.
At the center were cell phone calls of the defendants and other persons who had been intercepted by the police.
The hard thing is that rockers almost always stick to a law for them – and don’t testify.
The same applies to victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims was unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the public prosecutor’s office in Frankfurt (Oder) said on demand that new traces had appeared since the last trial.
Eleven more trial days are scheduled for the trial.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the passenger and rear seats, the hunger becomes noticeable.
Sure, this may be the cause of some cocktail or sparkling wine!
What’s closer than going to the next drive-in to indulge yourself in a little bit?
I admit, I like to be there when it comes to late night or early morning fast food.
A few fries, a cola, a burger - and then nothing like going home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangsters are noticeable.
Because what must be missing is that you regularly throw your fast food bags out of the car window?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on roadsides and in parking lots.
“Why?” I ask myself.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It’s not just that the paperwork is ruining the landscape.
Bags have also already covered up transport facilities such as guardrails, causing accidents.
But this is not what the said "disposable society" thinks about, probably it doesn't even know what this word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a backseat can look like after busy nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage piles up there.
There would be a few bags more or less nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food residues of others.
I already see the day coming when cities and municipalities are getting too stupid to clear away - and the fast food chains have to demand pledge for their bags.
Obama's Backsliders in Health Policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama made a withdrawal yesterday from his frequently repeated, unequivocal promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of dismissal, Republicans accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama made his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama urged those Americans who have received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“You have a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different rate, as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
“I want to tell these Americans directly: they deserve better,” Sebelius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to a behind her seated adviser at yesterday's hearing in the House of Representatives was recorded after a dispute with Missouri Republican MP Billy Long about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed with the question why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived a state-sponsored insurance policy to conclude a tariff on HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Jerusalem government does not confirm attack on Syrian airbase
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous said Thursday that Israeli fighter planes had attacked an airbase in Syria’s Latakia a day earlier.
The target was “missiles and related equipment” that the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah, it said, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shelled on the night from Wednesday to Thursday and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, showing Russian S-125 Neva defensive missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 has a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously, in part successfully, tried to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would signify the crossing of a “red line” that would be followed by a military response.
John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, said that US espionage had “goed too far.”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, hinted at softening the U.S. defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying the espionage “has gone too far in some cases.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
The leaked information has led the U.S. government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
At a video-connected speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without a doubt, the president and I, as well as others in the government, have learned of some things that have happened almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to do so existed, which goes back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, to 9/11.”
He was the first senior member of the U.S. government to acknowledge that US espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone too far."
The President is determined to provide clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations.
He added: “We are dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eager to kill people, blow up and attack governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to alleviate concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. in the anti-terrorist efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration over National Security Agency surveillance.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board in view of our joint efforts against terrorism,” Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a Democrat and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of intelligence said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited from documents handed down by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary, declaring that it was common on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority was preparing the trip of Congress to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said that there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments must be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years.
“Although we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the resentment about the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is concerned about a deployment of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
“We will decide on his deployment in the short term,” said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six hits.
The Mainzers have already to give up the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals for imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of making a false statement by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the recordings of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to devising the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a adult women’s prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has turned to the State Department in Canberra to ask for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
“We’re very worried, of course, but we hope she’ll be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is on a free foot against a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is on holiday in the resort town of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may try to improve its bad tourist image, and therefore acquittal will occur.
