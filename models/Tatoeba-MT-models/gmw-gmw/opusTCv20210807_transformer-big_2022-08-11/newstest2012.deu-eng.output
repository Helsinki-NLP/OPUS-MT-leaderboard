No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused the request to abolish the paragraphs on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the detained former prime minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the application for mitigation of the penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly detrimental contract with Russia to purchase natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, in December the appeal of the convicted is to be negotiated in court.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as the regime’s political revenge, and even in the West the trial raised the suspicion of the court’s bias.
The motion to remove Section 365, on the basis of which the former prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 deputies.
It would have required 226 votes.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As is customary in this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council confessed to the customary law of the Sharia, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft, one cuts off one’s hand in short.
Women should also forget about emancipation as soon as possible, possible apostates of the faith are executed, and so on.
In the future, instead of a single dictator, the society will be united by the Qur’an from tribes fighting against each other.
In short, there will be an order in Libya that is hardly imaginable and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly suit the aforementioned Libyans.
In this way, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their apology, perhaps only the fact that NATO’s airstrikes were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah Himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in a gun change, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians disembarked in the person of the dictator of a political ally without any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the Hiesigen are relieved of one concern - namely the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But do the petroleum companies also get the black gold at a mock price without occupation?
Hardly and so the West can finally boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If they do not destroy the Shariah representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe are the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm depth roared through Europe.
The individual states published their data on their GDP for the third quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, while Germany and France were on the rise.
The bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts for the economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP was expected to grow by 0.5%, France's GDP by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth 0.3% instead of 0.1% predicted), while France admitted a slight decrease of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year.
However, compared to the previous quarter, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistical Office, the trend of growth slowing down economic performance was confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The main events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year, but it stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Between July and September, the eurozone and the EU’s economy grew by 0.2 percent compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The return on their 10-year government bonds rose to 28.45%.
The returns on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems.
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
In Germany, voices are heard that the ECB should become a creditor of the last instance.
Czechs qualified for Euro
In Montenegro they won 1-0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the toughest task of the entire season!
She won 1-0 in Montenegro thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper and a splendid goal by Petr Jiráek.
With a great deal of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious lead from the home game and will once again not be missing in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotional game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won 1-0, thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant 'ech' and the hero of the day Jiráek in Montenegro, and has thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Due to the precise defensive match of the Czech team, they could only put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half.
The pitching birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr'ech the Czech selection will participate in the European Championships next year, it is also gratifying that the domestic football flows a premium in the amount of about 200 million.
From the very first few minutes onwards, we played quite combative football.
Both teams combined for a long time and so played mainly around the middle line.
Also in the second half, the pressure of the home team remained out and the long strikes in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country’s core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object at noon Tuesday and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
A few hundred students from the University of Isfahan, Iran, formed a living sign on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to show that they were ready to protect their country’s core program, even with their own lives if necessary.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran did not seem to have given up its efforts to create a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack with the intention of largely paralyzing the Iranian nuclear program, the Israeli press said the nuclear enrichment plant in Natan’s target would also be from the center in Isfahan.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: It does not have breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children ages 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys have shown that obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important to a person’s healthy development is the environment in which he grows up and are the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half as often on the table as in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had French fries for dinner on the day before the reconnaissance campaign under the motto "obesity is not a coincidence".
In families with fats, sports are not exactly one of the favorite occupations, but it also affects the majority of today’s students – only 15 percent responded that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of the school year last year, with nearly 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic surveyed.
This was already the second year of the action "Adiposity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy diets and lack of exercise in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children who are overweight or even obese.
“Only half of the children surveyed, for example, claimed to eat breakfast-second lunch-vesper evening bread five times a day – one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet,” according to one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the students’ families have breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast on their own.
The worst thing was the finding that in every tenth family there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the foundation of a healthy daily diet.
The survey test showed, among other things, that in the families of overweight children, unhealthy chips are consumed much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, only less than half of their parents do – namely only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to compose their own diet according to their appetite and opinion.
“What Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 prefer in terms of diet is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite dishes were many meals, meat dishes and of course sweets.
"Alarmingly, above all, the great popularity of sweet lemonades," is emphasized in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, the main dish, pasta was just ahead of poultry.
The children hardly liked legumes and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get proper information.
"In the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after the enlightening lecture 'Adiposity is not a coincidence', there was a significant shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating in many cases," the project's results indicate.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet limos, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also crossed poultry or fish much more often in the questionnaire as the main dish of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article on how stylists learn, I had a bit of a joke that that was a bit too much stuff to start with.
I didn’t know at all what was coming.
Lectures by three industry professionals, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar about how the "in the square" works.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer we get to the exam, the more information and practical tasks ahead of us.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with director Alena (not a single man takes part in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
After all, these are most of us.
Some have a too short neck, the others a too young figure without proper curves and again others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually laminated wide shoulders, to extend the neck or to conjure out the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a woman type like Jennifer Lopez – with a big bosom, wide hip and narrow waist – pretty and figuratively, without her being too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or trousers really do not fit, you should at least get tailored to measure a piece.
You will not regret that, because well-fitting clothes are simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one of the poles, which always slides up and down, sticks in the waist, etc.
Boylike figures, in turn, can allow themselves to wear clothing with folds, bumps, applications, embroidery or refining.
With this amount of information and figure types, I’m glad I have a whole week to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that, given the assigned homework, it is almost impossible to do.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity for whom she was to come up with suitable outfits - daywear and evening dress.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and its figure type.
I'm supposed to "put on" Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside I cheer, because that is much better for me personally than to dress Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably increased to a hundred kilos in recent times (well, that’s a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments from magazines or search the internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design will be expressed.
It is also very important to think about the graphical side of the styling.
The stylist not only physically attracts the models, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kamenák told us about this.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about character types, was seasoned by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorná, by fashion designer Jakub Polanka and by fashion photographer Ben Rená.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And skilled stylist can work with a single item of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks completely different.
“Play with it,” he said.
But the most important advice for me was: “First you have to know the rules perfectly.”
“Only then can you hurt her,” Jakub said.
At last I realize why we have to break all these teachings, what can be combined with what and why, even if you often see something completely different in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared much more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So you have to be prepared for a ten-page fashion story (say ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
All of this must be expected in the design of the outfit.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half of the success, confirmed us also Jan Pokorn.
You just have to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer who made image and marketing a world star.
In the Czech Republic, one is more reserved for the services of a stylist.
Also, well-known personalities often consider this to be money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something that I look like is secondary).
And if anyone of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she is very likely to impose a completely different (smaller) size on us than he or she really needs.
Then you only need to google to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has returned to or decreased, etc.
Jan and Mario urged us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist just needs to focus on fashion and then “assemble” the outfit.
In his work, he must communicate primarily with the people he styles and he must be a skilled psychologist.
Evaluate people without embarrassment and stand by their opinion.
“If any manager orders us to look at her wardrobe and add some pretty pieces, then we can’t clear her whole wardrobe and say, ‘My God, that’s horrible.’
“You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can wear,” Mario says.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must include.
So such a bag that you put on the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprietaries.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, unwinders for hair removal or safety needles, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (to help the stylist take photos of products, such as handbags or hats), special clips that are used to rip the back of the clothes if they are too big (pins or other clamps are not allowed, of course).
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to put shoes under properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is flat, you can damage the shoe sole, let alone the outside.
We sticked and we sticked...
With the scissors you must not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you have to be really clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
This skill is not exactly my strength.
All of this was only the fraction of what we heard on the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - to devote yourself to styling at a professional level is not a breeze.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The original careless ride is made by a series of completely avoidable, dilettantious mistakes to the routine ride to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, what good is it if obviously no one wanted to do a little more?
Even before he came to the shop tables, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move the already-old game series "Need for Speed" back into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not just one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about the fitting passages where the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to at NFS, in the end, a lot is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially they are quite decent arcade races, but overall, the game is diminished by some unnecessary bugs that have been present in this series for more or less a few years.
So it is actually no longer a mistake, but rather a sign of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure begins very well.
First introduced to history, whose main character Jack has certain personal problems; the only solution seems to be to take part in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the west coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea includes a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in a different, sufficiently different and interesting environment.
You don’t have the impression that game would always offer the same thing.
Some environments are still very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the previous parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal scenery or high up through deep snowy scenery looks visually very pleasant.
From time to time, untypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, one is surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts sight.
In the mountains, you have to be very careful not to be spilled by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are quite well built in.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to overtake (classical race against the stopwatch), then you expect a personal duel with a single opponent.
And the police are also interfering, wanting to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty is passages in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from anyone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
However, it is surprising that there are far fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (in concrete terms, only three).
Ultimately, this is more of an advantage, because at least this element has no chance of getting bored - it is one of the elements in the context of the above that make the game more varied.
The driving model moves into the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not tear out trees, but on the other hand, one could not say that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed racing model still lives up to the local driving model, although you could find better ones in the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not completely O.K.
A game of this kind is hardly expected to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have practically no idea of how the car behaves before an impact on any object, then obviously everything is not okay.
Typical example: When you make a close overtaking or passing by on accommodating cars, you "stroll" the other car only slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into a spin and shoot wild pirouettes.
Or drive the car right to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter, but it is always annoying.
The restarts are solved in this way: if you have total damage or land far away from the track, then you throw the game back to the last point of reference of the track.
Only - in each race you have only five restarts.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts from the front.
So the restarts are more like a tool, in case something doesn’t work, but you shouldn’t rely on it.
Sometimes it doesn’t even help to restart, there’s nothing more than learning the critical section from your mind.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves you have to go through, for example, in a very specific way, otherwise you simply do not pass through.
Elsewhere, you will always find "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you are first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see the opponent passing by two cars in front of you, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive them around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent at the same point and again here without regard to the timing.
The most crazy thing is to finish the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The adversary must obviously overtake you here on the devil.
And if he is in front of you, of course he takes a look, so that you start driving your own car a few times in lumps.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intent is so clear that you quickly miss out on the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and in some cases so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "guilt" for it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that can't be bored, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of carts during the races.
You should not miss the gas stations on the track, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American sedans for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical journeys, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game history also goes the task mode (challenges) - i.e. the races in the individual locations you know from the history.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points to gain for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the story.
To get to the higher level of the driver, various items have to be opened up: from the car to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is connected at the same time with the online Autolog function, which among other things compares your own results with those of other players and also provides further collective functions.
One of the other incomprehensible carvers is a situation in the last race of history.
Here you get by car to a subway tunnel (mostly), where you go on the tracks long in the dark (mostly).
On the tacho there are numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (in my opinion), but there suddenly comes a subway from behind and drives you uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial team, we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think us to be so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and here and there even brilliant.
It is all the more annoying that in some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and this is sometimes quite dramatic.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound playback is O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a scale as wide as possible rather young audience, a soundtrack a lá "of everyone something" - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not to be diminished by the above-mentioned totally unnecessary mistakes, we could have argued with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But this is how the game looks somehow unfinished.
It’s a great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared for these mistakes to come into your eyes with the power of airport headlights.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has made the balance between the individual institutions tangible."
I didn’t expect such a hard war to ignite.”
"It will take five or six years for the waves to smooth out and everyone to get used to their new role," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenová began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
In the first part of her lecture, she showed how seriously she took the motto "understandable and open about Europe", in which she managed to describe the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that she could have envied so many lecturers from the Faculty of Law at Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, there was criticism that he was too inconspicuous – a gray official who wasn’t capable of such a role, but I have to say it left everyone breathless about how well he handled the matter.
He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, has clear ideas of how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the High Representative’s new position on foreign affairs and security policy in response to the question: Who is this really - the European Union? Which number should I call?", as an important step towards the unification and better legibility of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our quartz oil hats.
Mrs Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, lives and intends to live in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs would have mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also hosted the Eastern Partnership Summit.
The government’s case during the presidency was described as a major negative, which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently full of work.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only the presidency but also the subsequent crisis that has not yet been overcome.
And then there is the need to approve the EU’s seven-year budget, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today’s economic situation.
Whether it’s going to be a lean and economical budget, which industries are given priority, which countries are more and which are less promoted – all of this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
“If I don’t like something, it’s grayish abbreviations, foreign words, and technical jargon that no one understands.
How can I, as a citizen, really know if you are making up crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes in Brussels or if someone actually wants to ban us from quartels?
She would also have liked to use the EU’s soil to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who perceive the negatives rather than the positives.
The weak representation of Czechs in European institutions is all the more annoying.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
“Believe me, when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is around, the Frenchman next to me says, ‘Hey, what are your heads together – is that your V4 again?’
According to Mrs Vicenové, the EU expects in the future, above all, tough rules for the budgetary policies of the Member States.
As much more real, as a "European federation", she sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds.
“We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries away from the eurozone.
“We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it was said that only those countries that want to work together and those that don’t want to work together should stay away.”
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'Europe of different speeds'," Vicenová expects.
In this regard, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues must be discussed by all Member States and not only by the countries of the euro area with an impact on the EU as a whole.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM’s strategy, that would probably be the word “longevity.”
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern enterprise, although a century has passed since its inception.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by her first boss - visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
Already he represented the slogan that countless global problems could easily be solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the hallmark of the future giant's life (and at the same time the title of the company's in-house magazine, which began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen’s thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, this long-term thinking means a continuous move towards the future.
IBM survived and has been successful for a century because it has remained true to its principles and has not shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technologies, business and society over the course of our first century.
We hope to be able to do even more in the next hundred years,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well-thought-out system
As early as the 1930s, Watson operated social care for his employees - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baca in Czechoslovakia: the IBM people, as one of the first American employees, had paid leave, an insurance policy by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well-thought-out pay system for the best innovators and dealers.
IBM’s long-term relationships with its customers are equally sophisticated.
From the very beginning, the company was brilliant in talent promotion - as one of the first companies in the world, IBM lifted all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan will replace at the top of IBM next year is by a woman – by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has held the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming in recent years, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, almost half a million people employed in the company.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image, both indoors and outdoors.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist, Harvard Business School professor and author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” added George Colony of Consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself emphasizes, it is a difference to be present only in the market or to shape it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of its logo called "Big Blue" because of its family name - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It’s one of the most versatile technology companies ever – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products – from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His most well-known inventions include, for example, ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or the floppy disk.
With about $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (after Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the tastes of today's customers - unhappy were, for example, the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC jr.
“Business is based on the forward movement, so you shouldn’t be emotionally tied to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them again.
Unlike Microsoft, which basically stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
In IBM’s profits, most of the services, software and hardware are involved in one-fifth of each.
In 1990, hardware was represented the most, with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, but at the same time it has invested $58 billion in purchasing promising technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world for the first time like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment volume in the midst of the great economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives the current crisis unharmed.
The value of IBM’s shares has increased 120 percent since 2008, and the company’s net profit continues to grow.
IBM’s corporate slogan is: Everything can be changed – only the values can’t.
This is why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also cope with the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flight
Founded 100 years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took over the name IBM only in 1924 - originally a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later IBM company was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They had technologies such as the famous puncture card watches to register the beginning and end of the work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the boss of the competition company Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
This leader then even overshadowed the founders of IBM – based on Watson’s ideas, the company’s invincible culture and identity continues to this day.
Watson managed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and distributing all sorts of machines for trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash registers.
Over the first four decades of Watson’s leadership, he doubled his revenues to nine million dollars, and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM technicians and computers helped guide NASA’s flights into space – to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, man’s famous flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time came to market in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand, it bought the consultancy part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and entered the business of high-value consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the concept of “Smarter Planet”.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned before, e.g. to improve the situation in traffic and city management.
In the trading sector, IBM recently launched the “Smarter Commerce” platform to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Back in 1932, IBM established a branch in Czechoslovakia, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM’R also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a world-class research team dedicated to voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtá about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtá (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtá (53) had become her lover by the protector of Iveta Bartonová (45), Darina still remained hopeful that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the rest of life she has set clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but no more than my partner," D. Rychtá explained.
When Darina Rychtá offered refuge in her own home to the singer I. Bartonová, she probably would not have even dreamed of what would happen to her husband.
When Iveta, at her insistence, moved out and back to ’any after 30 days, Joseph went with her.
He even publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, yes, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband – but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychyt doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtá Iveta Bartosová should leave in the future, then he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
“He’s the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common home, I’m not going to drive him out.”
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I still have certain ties," said Ms. Rychtáová; but she also said that she had already separated emotionally from him and insisted solely on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina locked his back door has so far been carried with dignity.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I'm staying with Iveta, that doesn't change anything."
“My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that.”
"The company continues to run, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I make the purchases."
"I talk to Darina normally, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychte (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to find a new love, he doesn’t want to stop her.
“We don’t sleep together, so I don’t care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta, and that's why I take all responsibility.
The worst female vices: What about you?
When the men are asked to call some typical female vices, they shake some out of their sleeves without exception.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we re-examine some immorality, which makes men's blood in their veins?
Purchasing addiction
Does your husband accuse you of being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one hater per week?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more for promotions?
In your case, it’s really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping appetite under control.
But hand on heart, which woman already can stand to stroll through a clothes shop in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try out all (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often the pure hell.
Think about how many times you've told your husband - you'd rather stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five pounds - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
“Do I even like you?”
Does that seem familiar to you?
Yeah?
Then you may be among the women who are really obsessed with what they look like.
That doesn’t mean you should let go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, the women are becoming more and more intolerable.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It is a fight against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - and do this at least twice a week.
Do you scold your partner because he hits the clean tiles again with dirty shoes, do you scold the children because the washbasin that has just been scrubbed is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, when polishing takes so much effort?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not exaggerate anything and the order and cleanliness in family life do not come first.
This immoderate sense of purity can ultimately also harm the mutual relationships and, above all, the peace in the family.
Stitching
"Dirty sneakers come into the laundry basket."
“Do you really want to wear those old socks again tomorrow?”
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, don’t be surprised that it puts him on the palm.
This is not meant badly, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to complain that much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and kick, there is whispering behind their backs or even slandering or forging alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, which is why they like to cheer through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a little harmless gossip in stock.
Hand on heart, that’s all women’s.
But this is not to be confused with claws of coarsest caliber, to which nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone in their environment and which pose a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráek helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Ice hockey striker Jaromir Jágr played a big part in the NHL’s 5:3 win on the Carolina ice in the Monday match with two assistants and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old hockey star was in both cases Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game also recorded Jágr's fellow player Jakub Voráek.
Jágr claimed after the game to journalists that he had predicted a big evening for Giroux.
"Before the game, I'm telling him that he's got a hat-trick today."
I somehow felt that.”
"Sometimes such a feeling comes over," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal at the first shot of the flyers.
A little later, the second hit also had "a Czech track".
Voráek fought the puck behind the hurricanes' gate and presented it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
One second before the first-third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-handed, but the second-third again belonged to the flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds directed his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love to play with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s certainly one of the top three,” Jágr said.
“I wouldn’t have imagined in my life that at the end of my career I was playing with such an ice hockey player as he did.”
"I'm very happy about that."
“I’ll tailor my game to myself.”
"All these years in the NHL my fellow players set their game on me and now the skewer is turning around," Jágr smiled.
Carolina made the game a drama - through the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came to a goal.
But Matt Read prevented any further complication in which he was successful in the majority of two against one.
"Excellently, Pronger was still operating in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I took a ride and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to meet him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráek described the final match.
This victory put Philadelphia at the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defensive player of Montreal Jaroslav Pa'a'ek injured himself in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an injury to the upper body.
The Candiens, in addition to their experienced Beck, also lost their lead in the penalty shooting 2:3.
One of the punitive shots could not be transformed by Tomác Plekanec.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high disease-related failure in the defensive - they only finished the game with five defensive players.
"That's bad."
"We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young players."
“But there’s nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
“Every time we switched, one wave of attack after another, and we had nothing to do with it.”
“We should have made the game easier and got the puck out of our third.”
There were still reserves here," said P.K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondáej Pavelec fought back thirty shots from Tampa Bay, contributing significantly to the 5:2 win over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the jets, which ended a series of five defeats, five different shooters participated.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorized state travel agencies in the former SSR: Edok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies only sold travel to the socialist countries of the Eastern Bloc, and only the chosen ones were allowed to travel to the West.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (German Democratic Republic - GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean Peninsula at the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to the Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern bloc (including Czechoslovakians) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the SSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel would not be possible.
Back then, the travel agencies also offered travel to the west, but then you had to accept huge snakes or also stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
This too was far from the end.
The so-called foreign exchange pledge - the condition for a trip to the West - was only given to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange pledge it would have been impossible to obtain the necessary funds (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most Czechs spent their holidays in the country, so it’s no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dates – a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is the fact that one could not travel to the most popular holiday country of the Czech Republic - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation in the neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and to Germany.
The Czechoslovakians simply couldn’t get enough of their trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to be there for at least a few days.
Thus, the Czech holidaymakers slept in a tent in the park when they traveled to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in a hotel or pension at the time.
A typical feature of Czech foreign travel at the time was a trunk packed with canned, beer and permanent sausage etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the western currency freely.
Our level of life and, as a result, our average salaries increased, which resulted in another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997, travel agencies began to regularly prepare trips through charter flights, which made air travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the US, already had currency-free payments with all the advanced countries of the world, making travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-saturate" travel came in 2000, when, thanks to the high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - to Thailand.
Since then, every year direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers fly to far away sunny countries; this year you fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
The 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the era that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, making our country definitely one of the most advanced countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they spent more than CZK 15 per capita for a single holiday, including the cost of the resort.
The general meeting is to find a new chairman – again a pat.
For almost five months, Czech football has not had a chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hazek at the head of the Czech Football Federation (FAR) will not even be known after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there has been no agreement on the electoral order to be elected.
Without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindáich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomás Paclák.
In June, he resigned, calling on his colleagues to come to an agreement and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hacek, the old squabbles between the two chambers of association broke out again, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on September 16, when the new chairman was to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People’s House in the Prague district of Smáchov for no reason, because the trial did not lead to any results and it was not only about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote at the full assembly - only the constitutional representatives or even the officials equipped with a power of attorney.
On this single point, at least partial agreement was reached, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, whose representation on the basis of power of attorney was not valid.
However, disputes over the electoral order continue.
Even the Executive Committee did not bring more clarity to the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Although the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how should you proceed in the third round to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The issue is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or whether a completely different model needs to be found," noted Duan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAR, who represents professional football in the management.
According to the constitutional model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for which he is running wins.
Moravia is allegedly ready to accept the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers will win.
The Czech side in turn insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds make no sense at all, this mode would question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best not to bend the electoral order, but to vote according to valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomás Paclák also agrees, even though it appears that the constitutional order is most likely to meet Pelta from all candidates.
"My wish is to be elected as far as possible after the statutes."
"So that no nonsense alternatives are invented, as at the last Annual General Meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzea, who is running for the first time and demarcated against Pelta in his statements.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively together in the future.
"The potential qualification of the national team for today's European Football Championships would certainly help to calm the minds."
"If football is only riding on the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts, both on a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to 'correct' the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a re-blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"However, I hope common sense ultimately wins," Rajchl said.
There is no longer enough time to agree on all sides.
Some negotiations are supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete until the qualifying match at all.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kusera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not start in the morning because of a technical disturbance in Prague and so they feverishly searched for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the barrage relay.
Ultimately, the meeting at ministerial level is likely to be held on Wednesday.
Josef Dobe, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to move the divided parties within the country’s largest sports association to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: government grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the STV, which should point the new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclák goes into the fight for the position of the chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomác Paclák, the head of the Pilsner footballers before the extraordinary general meeting had been able to identify a strong candidate who would have fulfilled all his expectations about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA-R), he would not have engaged in the fight for this top position at all.
“If there was a good candidate, I would fight for him and renounce the election.”
"But in the current situation, it has not been possible to find such an adept," Paclák said.
So the main reason for Paclák to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindiich Rajchl is to prevent the supposed favourite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAR.
He also stresses that, in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the role of chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
“I have spoken to a few people personally.”
“It’s hard to believe that some of them told me they didn’t want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
“Such views would have changed,” he said.
Most of all, Paclice allegedly interferes with Pelta's connection with the chairman of the Pilsner District Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man of controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable that Pelta should hold the position of chairman.
"In his victory, today's state would be preserved and Czech football would not go ahead at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be twice as bad for football," Paclák said.
He also refers to the fact that Pelta's name fell in connection with telephone interrogations for investigation in a corruption affair some time ago, but from which Pelta emerged without impunity.
“I don’t know what prestige Pelta’s victory should bring to football.”
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclák, who saw his earlier statement that "he would sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta became chairman."
If Paclák should win in the Thursday elections, he could well imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Similarly, another candidate - Rajchl, whom Paclák had supported before the October Annual General Meeting, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great skills."
“I could imagine him as the head of the national team.”
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
“I don’t put my nose on matters that I don’t understand,” said Paclik, who had caused a stir in September with the fact that he was behind the dismissal of the referee commission headed by Luci Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damková.
Paclák himself claims that he feels he has grown to the role of the Association Chairman.
And he relies on his ability to lead private companies, since last summer he has also been head of Pilsen, which celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
“I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups, which tend to influence disciplinary and vocational commissions, which develops into horrible situations," said Paclice, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, towards Sparta's chief Daniel Kutinsky.
One of his priorities was to strengthen relations between the FAR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political leaders for more money from the lottery tax flowing into the sport.
“This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to.”
“When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their reasoning, but they also have to say clearly and clearly where the money goes,” he said.
His connection to the Pilsner club also does not see Paclák as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta in turn is connected to Jablonec, Rajchl to the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"It doesn't make much sense in my opinion to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsner Club to a third person to return after a year and a half," Paclák said in a statement.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FA-R, which would exclude a stalemate situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for the presidency, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would be strong for the FAR to get new statutes, which in the future will rule out disputes about the electoral order from the outset.
The official from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse in the event of a possible success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the raising of funds in the event of his election.
At the last moment, he decided to participate in the election before the last general meeting, so the two-month break would help him defend his ideas about leading football and present them in a broader context.
“People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday.”
“He feels that it is high time that the association was led by someone, the man who is primarily associated with the Jablonecer club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
He also believes that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today’s electoral problems are due to the euphoria that prevailed at the time of Ivan Hazek.
“Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had accepted.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman as of September," Pelta said.
He used the revision of the most important document of the Civil Union as a lure for the delegates.
“If I become chairman, I take it personally and am willing to take personal responsibility if it doesn’t work.”
“This is a principled thing without which he cannot be,” Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to distinguish himself from his counterparts.
Earlier he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education and he knows well that his counter candidate would be his first deputy.
He did not attack Tomác Paclák for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes.”
However, his attacks were degrading and many people were shocked by his election campaign.
“This is also why many now doubt his real character,” Pelta addressed his opponent, who must remain true to his proclamations, which he already made in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest classes to the national team.
And this should be the flagship of Czech football.
“I would also strive to end all affairs – from the Causa Bohemians, to the reverberations of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"According to this, I would plunge into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for the whole football," the forty-six-year-old candidate, ,,TK, said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his move into the top of Czech football would not mean personnel cleansing.
"I would have to get acquainted with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where the long anarchy is understandably nervous.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing on Thursday.
“If it’s really the only controversial point you’re going to make in the third round, we’ll get over it.”
“Football needs credibility and it only wins back when it finally has a new leader,” Pelta said in a statement.
Rajchl promises that the FAR is starting to work hard under him
If former Vice-Chairman Jindich Rajchl was elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly fool many people in the association.
Rajchl promises to start working hard in the event of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and hold the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve Bohemian’s case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work that previous chairman Ivan Hazek has begun.
“As president, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole.”
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national elections, professional football, to performance football for the youth.”
"I don't mean to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in a conversation for TK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competencies in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member is devoted to a certain area."
And I’m going to distribute hard tasks so that football can move forward in every segment with miles.”
That wouldn’t be a delight for many, because instead of just criticizing others’ work, they would have to start working really hard themselves,” he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement I have considered not to run at all.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
“But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don’t constantly throw clubs between my legs and question every step I take,” he said.
“A lot of people told me that I shouldn’t give up because others would do it.”
"That's trust that you can't lose," he said.
Supposedly, he is also motivated to continue the work he has begun under Hazek.
“In two years we’ve done a lot of work and I don’t want to throw that away.”
"Proceedings have been launched that will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would be reluctant to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hadek.
“I believe in systematic action and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t bring.”
“Behind him are mainly people who would make football so that it would only be there for the chosen.”
I can be blamed, but I’m not partial.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want football for everyone because then everyone is going well and not just the chosen ones,” Rajchl said.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
“Even though some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia.”
“For example, it’s time to consider whether you shouldn’t divide the league into a Czech and a Moravian part, whose winners then each rose to the first league.”
"Then it could not happen that only three Moravian clubs play in the league today, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Because now the head of the Pilsner club Tomác Paclák has joined the fight for the role of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances of being elected.
“I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me,” Rajchl said, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the fact that the association does not pull on a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football to re-confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclák to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he has done excellent work in Pilsen in just one year."
"If elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hazek initiated, and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing of the commissions."
He certainly wouldn’t want to bend things in his favor,” Rajchl judges his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Peddler pools in Ufo look, Prunkpools in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience their blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike rest their tired legs in sprudge pools.
A book shows where wellness in the water is best.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past one and a half years, one thing was not to be missed in her baggage: her swimsuit.
Lying backwards on the water, she looked up in artfully designed domes, she swam towards marble pots waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming halls.
If she liked a bath, she quickly added it to her notebook - with interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "travel to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn’t have much on her hat with sports, Meder says – only in the water it’s different.
Only annoying that swimmers have to settle with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can inhale the enchanting scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful birdsong in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Plucking in the plunge pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in bathrooms is so great, because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real eye-catcher: "In place of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"It is transparent on the one hand, but on the other it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything visually doubles: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format picture volume "Bathtime Joys" conveys information about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
Notable specimens were discovered by the pool collector Meder during her research in Hungary.
In addition to splendid spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a quaint karsh cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászén).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have an eye on the whole city from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look at the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam room there is a window from which you can watch the hustle and bustle on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a Ufo just landed in the Alps.
It evaporates from three upwardly open shells in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool the pool collector Meder rose the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell like sulphur, and in the Arpád Bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it smells so much like heating oil, which is hardly believed to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose sludge sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing bath in the Czech city of Luhatschowitz, she found a closed terrain.
The bathroom, designed in 1902 by the architect Ducán Jurkovic, has now been closed.
As Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-and-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
The decay, on the other hand, has been counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
Three phases of construction have already passed this bath; you can discover not only neo-Romantic elements dating back to its erection in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in Alhambra style, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite pool of the pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because it originated from the Black Forest.
“It’s already an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit,” Meder says.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank examines commodity business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the chief executive wants to draw conclusions.
Hamburg - )
For German citizens, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable, according to a study, that banks speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions exit this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving up prices - and therefore the banks bear a share of the global hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer activists specifically targets German banking chief Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, commodity betting was meant to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, most experts agree that the gamers have decoupled from supply and demand - and are making profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the US competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: he promised to examine the allegations and said no business was “worth it to put Deutsche Bank’s good reputation at risk.”
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the audit is to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Executive Board of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will then report the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in commodity business, or even the complete turn-off.
Ackermann builds on his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reaffirmed his criticism of the financial industry: “Wetten on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are damaging the general good today.”
Ackermann is now particularly in duty as the top banking lobbyist.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter whether Mr. Ackermann is talking about people suffering from hunger or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank.”
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to present a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the CEO would not be joining the Supervisory Board.
With a turn away from controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And for possible losses he hardly has to shave - after all, his successor would have to do with it.
One in two would terminate commodity plants
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Institute Forsa surveyed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only 11% consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments betting on food prices.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is involved in such transactions: one in two would, according to the survey, terminate all investments where money flows into the commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances of such a bank, 49 percent said they would consider canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21st house in Vienna
The Relocated Pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with ups, downs and a happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels won prizes in 1958, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and got lost.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
When it comes to modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold turns and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer is a striking and famous example for the 1958 Brussler Weltausstellung.
Schwanzer’s pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d’Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built Austria’s pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus a bowl-like auxiliary building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, had been erected after the world exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna South Railway Station, rebuilt and opened a museum of the 20th century in 1962 - it was called the "20s House".
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building was empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21st house" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a fortune in every way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007, has achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a PhD art historian with a considerable career, among others in her youth as an ice skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, emphatically implemented the conversion with politicians and conservationists, she procured public funds and private sponsorship funds and determined the use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookstore, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
Then Krischanitz was the ideal occupation for the implementation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich’s Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but also because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an “enormously important place” for him, where he had watched the exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and reused.
There were far greater problems with the current reconstruction: the building was "an energy sling," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements provided space for the new use, a lowered trench of light between the house and the street ensures exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tail pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish-brown anti-rust shade.
The movie theater is exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under strict supervision of the Monument Authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also liked the Heritage Office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rugged floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and lightweight.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "raise a real consciousness".
In this case, however, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, because there has been a city-building fortune: around the Swiss Garden is just the completely new planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential houses.
And another lucky event may happen: The 21er house could be reinforced by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and it is heard that she is already negotiating with the city for a neighborhood location in the Swiss garden.
Railway Plans Winter Crisis Package in Millions
The railway has developed a crisis plan to prevent train outages in winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an intra-group crisis plan, that by 2015 investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned.
This is intended to achieve better availability of vehicles and rail network even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external staff for snow removal on railway systems and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to rid railway platforms of snow and ice within four to five hours by the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary switches.
Two months ago, after a top meeting with government and industry, Bahn boss Rüdiger Grube warned of train outages and delays this winter as well.
Last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger traffic, as it lacked reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Federal Railways Office for years.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been struggling for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested significantly more often in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne Central Station had an axle fracture.
Deutsche Bank pays a million-dollar penalty in the United States
After the turmoil over boss Josef Ackermann comes new trouble from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million dollars there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now catching up with his past in the US: The Frankfurt Institute pays in a comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage papers.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of seducing cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost considerable value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down.
“We are satisfied that we were able to solve the issue without the parties having to go to court,” a German bank spokesman said.
The bank acknowledged no guilt in the comparison.
This also applies to the Citigroup, which committed to paying $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz welcomed the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is in charge of U.S. cooperative banks and jumps in to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billion-dollar damages compensated.
The comparisons that have now been made are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also knobbed other major banks and in the summer sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on house loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this became a disaster for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Although events have been going on for a few years, the banks are currently facing a sharp wind in the US.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to seek reparation or penalties for wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of prejudicing two U.S. state real estate financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, on about $200 billion in mortgage transactions.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit brought by the FHFA, which concerns several transactions worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters stand in line for “substantial losses”, but without specifying an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unsustainable and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought more than $10 billion worth of shares.
So far, the big American investor Warren Buffett had always stated not to invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies could be predicted poorly.
But now he has read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and purchases computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight’s blow in the financial world.
As a result, the IT original IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett revealed on CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has become one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which even in the economic crisis had provided for proper profits.
"They did a great job," Buffett said to the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for quite some time now.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had previously shunned technology companies.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett approached a freight railway, a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns around 80 subsidiaries and holds shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the most valuable companies in the world with smart investments.
Yet his lifestyle is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha".
After the announcement of the Buffett investment, IBM’s shares increased by one percent.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion in total on the stock market, making it, along with Apple and Microsoft, one of the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he did not want to get in.
Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer Zelle", Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and a Greek small businessman in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being responded to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German Turkish population in Germany.
For many German Turks, this means that a ghost long believed dead has returned: Since the fire attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more comparable violence against Turks with a right-wing extremist background.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions that are far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" headlined the internet issue of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the perpetrators was supposed to have been a V-man of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany responded with caution: on the weekend, it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil outside the Brandenburg Gate.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, it had been staged together - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media seems like a whip: "Germany's gift for fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
Even the German edition of the "Hürriyet" cannot take away from this mental connection.
“It starts to smell,” is the title of Ahmet Külahci’s column.
He stressed that people had been murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
Extremely critical discussions are being held in German-Turkish Internet forums about the actions of the police and their later success in searching.
The authors wonder why the German authorities were not much more likely to look for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some people are at least rhetorically prepared to take drastic measures: “If the migrants continue to be slaughtered here, there is nothing left but self-defense and armament.”
“It will be the best self-protection.”
“Of the goodness of the Enlightenment and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the internal peace in Germany,” writes Selen.
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in jeopardy was made clear by the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s.
The photograph of Solingen’s ruins is deeply anchored in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that distrust and distance can result in right violence.
The attacks, however, exacerbated our feelings on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
At the time, the Turkish press was particularly critical of the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire attack, he sent a condolences telegram to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted in his speech at the time how many taxes the local Turks made.
It is as if the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the distrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive investigation and re-evaluation of right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zürise
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went almost bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
Now let a German judge it.
Axel Weber certainly did not think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would start an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss big bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was pleased publicly, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and dropped friendly comments about future colleagues.
“The UBS has made the turnaround.
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A UBS dealer in London had bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and choked around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only famous in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been considered to be affected - and everyone asks: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It was already announced that Weber will be able to advise the bank from February 2012 onwards.
And he assumes the chairmanship of the board as early as May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but an economics professor and central banker, and would certainly have needed a training period.
He then takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "largest scandal bank in Europe".
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It began in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also exhausted Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: She wanted to become a very big number in investment banking as well.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank into the league of the world’s largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich, says: "I always portrayed the UBS as a model of a good bank for my students at the time."
“From today’s point of view, one asks oneself: How could I be so wrong?”
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it was first revealed that something was wrong in the UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli resigned surprisingly, who was previously considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, they knew why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had been overwhelmed with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
In order to shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of a whopping 13 billion francs.
For this she actually found investors, but one that some would have scolded until shortly before: an untransparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so secretive that you didn’t even know its name.
But that was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, in 2006, President Marcel Ospel, still the second best-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS faced the collapse and had to be rescued by the state in the face of its misinvestment in the financial crisis.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problem securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced convertible bond through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
Ultimately, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“Once again, we could not save the UBS,” says banking researcher Geiger.
The first catastrophe followed the second.
Just a few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have withdrew taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including penalties.
Thus, the UBS more or less openly confessed to having helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, the Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.
And the exodus of customer money.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to misspeculation and in asset management due to tax evasion assistance.
And just as it got a little quieter again, just as it was thought that UBS would get it right now, that follows this messy merchant story: a single trader is choking 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it becomes clear: Risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, an economist and financial professor at the University of Zurich's banking institute.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: "The problem with UBS is that it is not in control of risk control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago started to become guardians of the great assets of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - even beyond the Alpine Republic once the world collapsed.
Swiss banks’ vaults had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the sophisticated Swiss private bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The bank is headquartered on the Bahnhofstraße in Zurich, which leads directly from the main train station to Lake Zurich, which is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are splendid, the store rentals are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers such as Tiffany's can be found here between Swiss traditional shops such as the Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have been residing here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception hall of the UBS is entered through a heavy rotating door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front are thick leather armchairs, in addition to the bench logo, a large sign for the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has both Swiss major banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, but at some point displaced - or betrayed, as the boss of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he does business with the two major banks.
The UBS has become much too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where also the Anglo-Saxons would have spread.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if so, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first gave it high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster became visible.
“On that Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation,” writes author Lukas Haß in his book “The UBS Crash.”
Up to 68 billion Swiss francs, or about 45 billion euros, the politicians approved to save the big bank in the face of bankruptcy.
How did this come about?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into one giant group.
A bank was created that was already too big for the small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
It helped that the two different predecessor banks of UBS complement each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized one.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, the modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the abdominal man who has worked from banking to the top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
“This is a tragic case.”
Tragic, maybe.
It is clear that overconfidence came before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: pushing Goldman Sachs off the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time.
That's where the UBS wanted to go, up to the top.
Some steps have already been successful.
In the foreign exchange business and in stock trading, she played at the top.
Business consultants who were hired, however, highlighted a weakness: In the international interest rate business, in the banking language "fixed income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund before it invested in American subprime investments.
It evolved into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans – but also kept risks on its own.
Even when other banks were looking to leave.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So great is the euphoria, so deep is the case.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than expected.
Posts at the UBS became a slingshot seat and are still shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But investment banking should shrink sharply, so much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new banking chief Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was actually only intended as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly separated from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: he should permanently run the business of UBS, Zurich Bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
He cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
So far, he has only publicly said that he and his wife will look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe strains US exchanges
The impending recession in Europe has given US investors the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
The throttling of industrial production on the continent stifled the hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the change of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass were still half full last week, not half empty, but now the problems were pushed back to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial assets were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones index of the default values was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at the close of the trade.
In the course of trading, the market barometer commuted between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, a decrease of one percent.
The index of the technology exchange Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading with 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a decrease of 1.2 percent at 5985 meters.
The industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is adjusting to the end of the boom.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We’re not an island, we’re dependent,” Goldman Management’s Steve Goldman said.
Europe will not be able to liberate itself from a recession so quickly, and there will be further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear if Europe is strong enough to do anything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
That is why it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decade-old principle over the pile and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the traditional company’s stock price and led it to record just under one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett has paid an average of $170 per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s shares declined significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.
The company is making nearly all of its shares in China Construction Bank silver, raising $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the institute wants to boost its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the company collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday, figuring the value of the order at $18 billion.

At Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 in plus, 1913 in minus, and 82 unchanged.
Smart Crows Spread in Cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities resident complaints about dirt and noise of the animals accumulate.
A remedy against the “problem birds” is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer to get out of the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in cities
Naturalists attributed the problems in cities to the rural escape of the particularly protected seed crows: the use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys the traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing cultivation and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected by nature.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the county had provided negative headlines.
Critics had called the catching of animals in bird traps and slapping them with clubs particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the greasing, is of no benefit," said the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Spraying nests with water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“The animals are leaving, large colonies are splitting up and spreading out in other places.”
Ceramization is only conceivable as an exception to hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
“We have to live with them, we can’t get them away.”
Without the surroundings, the problem cannot be solved in the cities, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
It is conceivable to combine grazing of the animals from sensitive living areas and lock offerings to resettle them in other places.
On the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advertised a completely different approach to the animals: "A pimple on the face is the best way to endure it confidently."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where signposts inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: Seed crows not only use tools to get a treat, but even make their own tools.
Behavioural researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of the birds reaches.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they purposefully realized what size and shape a stone must have to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a more tricky problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid pieces of wire on them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket at the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even managed to do so right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland are at the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have solved the last tickets for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53th), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship appearance perfect after the 0-0.
The Czechs scored a 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off match with outsider Montenegro, after the hinspiel (2-0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia won the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland won a loose 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored further for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trader (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
Portugal got a tailor-made start at the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo chased a free kick of about 30 meters for early guidance.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his wide-shot qualities and scored 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through goaltender Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English leader Manchester City put a headball on the lower edge of the latte, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek meets for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding was the focus.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penal area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese a yellow card (36th).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial trade fair after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the Vice European Champion of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
This is the fifth consecutive time that the 1976 European champion is going to the European Championship.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionaries Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1 FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to survive a terror second in the initial phase.
Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot just past the goal of Cech in the 40th minute from the turn of the penalty area.
After the break, the cross bar had to be saved for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50th).
The door just before the end made everything clear.
In the meantime, Turkey missed the soccer marvel of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed a 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to leave his place on the bank of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a final round of the European Championships.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost gotten a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim was also unable to sink the bouncer in the goal.
After the second of terror, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who took place for Dortmunder Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were still in use.
Trapattoni goes to the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision in the back game with the 4-0 success, in the 32nd minute in the lead.
Konstantin Vassiliev (57.) made it up for the guests.
Ireland hit the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
It was only at the last moment that the Estonian back team prevented the possible leadership hit.
But in the 32nd minute it was time.
After an unsuccessful defense from finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball 1-0 over the line.

SAP to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will flow, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly,” Co-Chef Bill McDermott announced at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from around 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Around 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important building block of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP wants to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
In the past year, Walldorfers had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is almost unheard of.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our activities (...),” McDermott explained.
“Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, backed by comprehensive education.”
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Sensitive and generous, Peter Englund begins his new book "Beauty and Terror: A History of the First World War, told in nineteen Destinies" with a long list of main characters that goes to heart.
Here is a tip on how to proceed: gently cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in England's romance story, and these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when you, like England's men and women, are lost in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not misrepresent as “a work of anti-history.”
It contains only a few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, raging reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and horror" is almost the war experience of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war combined, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flares up like the votive candles in one church, some are added, while others are extinguished.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
"Beauty and terror" wanders with expert views of other war zones: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is almost a moving book from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that smells of Kordit.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears gunfire in the distance.
Who's coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," notes Englund, "were furnished with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
“Beauty and terror” follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmate.
Her stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely alive in England’s details-losing collection of small moments.
Many of them are about lack and help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replace, replace everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He talks more about replacement food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in chopped fat (and last served with a fake bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato shells, shoes lined with wood."
There were, as he noted, “837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says of war: “You feel that in spite of all that was meant for men rather than sitting in a chair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and pretending that such a facade means civilization and that there is no barbarity behind your own strengthened and battered shirt breast.”
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and will not take notice of or care of it.
“If you distance yourself from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this happens in front of an audience,” he writes.
Instead, it’s as horrible as “a convicted man who was hanged in secret.”
Other observations are about the old Europe that is falling apart and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict became increasingly an economic competition," writes Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the beastarium of the still young century”: “the word skilled and ideologically persuaded mass murderers in a tailor-made suit, slaughtering while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to infect a prostitute with a sexually transmitted disease in order to escape the front service.
“The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade of gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this,” he writes.
“Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives.”
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes supple and yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war “unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to wonder why their leaders make them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually more falsified such as Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West Nothing New" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I’ve ever read in a non-fiction book.
I'm not giving it back.
But it’s as if he’d snatched this page with the main characters in front of us with his book and set it on fire with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing mission helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and only a few senior officials were informed. All the others initially believed to participate in an exercise.
Police President Raymond W. Kelly was among them and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the decentralization and gave the house occupiers an enormous increase in public sympathies, were not allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster exercise had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials reinforced the so-called chaos training – counterterrorism measures, including the rapid removal of a large number of police officers – to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came “at the last minute,” someone familiar with the commands said, which spoke for a declaration as “exercise.”
“The few police officers involved, I know, didn’t know it was about Zuccotti Park,” said someone who wanted to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then waved back when hundreds of protesters gathered after they learned about these plans.
Officials from various police units were involved in Tuesday’s operation, including deployment commandos from all over the city – hundreds of mobile officials, usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people go in and out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 o’clock at night is a good time to go in.
“It was appropriate to do this when the fewest number of people are in the park,” he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers were ready before departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the pre-recorded messages throbbing out of the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials invaded the park in their light blue wind jackets, many protesters simply packed up their belongings and left the place.
Police said that no tents would be touched by 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, the police president’s spokesman, said this had been done for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the officers' dealings were very rough.
Mr. Browne said television cars on Church Street could have taken photos on the west side of the park.
As the police moved westwards due to the large mess of the protesters’ personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, their employees followed the city cleaning, which lifted what had been left behind.
Some protesters, who refused to go, were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved to position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
Approximately 10 people in the camp’s epicentre tied together on their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called to cut them off.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The evacuation was completed after 75 minutes, according to police.
Mr. Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were due to “unreasonable behavior and resistance to arrest.”
The most prominent official on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department, the highest uniformed official of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department of the crime officers, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
On Cortlandt Street, a street block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block further south, barricades were erected.
It was possible to observe how from these locations the police were expanding the perimeter around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, it was observed that several officials, many of them with protective signs, drove people outside.
Approximately 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
At 5 o’clock south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police car and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester came to the hospital.
Union of caretakers will file a lawsuit against the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the layoffs are not necessary and discriminatory due to their inappropriate influence on schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last option open to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school workers, care coordinators, and other staff who were among the city’s worst-paid employees and lost their jobs in a move on October 7, described the union leaders as political revenge for denying access to a health fund that the working groups maintained last year to close the budget gap.
This accusation was categorically rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the city council, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said last month that the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and explained to him that nothing in the budget specified that employees of school assistance would be fired.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Ministry of Education of a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference formally announcing the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city’s Ministry of Education as defendants and count eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are colored or Latino women, like most of the helpers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Department of Justice, said the city would not file the lawsuit and therefore its individual claims could not be commented on.
According to a draft lawsuit filed with the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals at schools in the poor neighborhoods of the city to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
She explains that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the schools of the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school auxiliaries in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 auxiliaries in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx have been laid off.
By noting the loss of five out of eight school workers employed at public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “This is not a neighborhood of sponsored parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts.”
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, although "excess" (German: transfer) in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred,” the draft lawsuit said.
Mission completed, Congress ready to agree on Libya
Ultimately, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed was the success of the revolt, the arrest and murder of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and the cessation of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate’s Committee on International Relations will adopt a resolution, which will be submitted to Chairman John Kerry (Massachusetts), along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for its successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their “courage.”
“This resolution honors the courageous people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties.”
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libyan debate.
This summer, legislators from both parties and the White House argued about the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving the U.S. military’s role in NATO’s Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a broad marginal group of both parties and there was no vote.
But that same day, the law passed in the Senate, and the Chamber voted against a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission fell into a kind of legislative purgatory – with a congress that was upset enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to finally take the floor under his feet.
Then the indecision of the Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell under Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Perhaps the Senate is ready to act.
The resolution “congratulates the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation” and “praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also reiterates “the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition of Libya to democracy.”
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Panel or will they split the legislators, as the June law did?
The last version encounters the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it’s up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a balanced budget, a top priority in almost every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, even though they have tried it often enough.
Goodlatte’s amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments submitted to this congress and covers a whole range of topics.
Some are double – the same law has been presented to both Congress and the Senate – others are only slightly different.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would “control federal spending.”
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients – especially Republican beginners who want to polish up their resume – the opportunity to brag about having “written” such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed in August requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget compensation.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of regulations members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit to two terms of office.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of amendments that, among other things, guarantee the right to good education and health care.
A change that forbids marriage among same-sex people, as well as a change that forbids the burning of flags, is a recurring template.
Some legislators also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eagerly as the members propose changes, they move faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators presented 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace fades compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Taken but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a distance during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night singing alone on the Broadway piece “The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow” and saying that the desire to recover is greater than that to return to Congress.
When she appeared together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC messages "20/20", she rang for words and needed help walking.
The show showed the severe slow recovery from the damage done by the bullet that split her skull, pierced the left side of her brain, and traversed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, which killed six people and injured 13 people, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang – describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied, "Very well."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour “20/20” special recorded shortly before the couple’s new book was released: “Gabby: A Story About Courage and Hope.”
The special tracks Gifford's recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, you can see her in the hospital bed, with a bare shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with your head.
A twitching with the lips.
And then, their first words: "What?"
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Gifford's recovery: You can see Congressmen singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'".
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she can’t remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he read an article to Giffords about the assassination on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
The alleged shooter Jared Lee Loughner is imprisoned in a Missouri prison and is forced to undergo medical treatment while waiting for his trial.
“A lot of people have died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, heart, heart."
Over the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't defeated,'" Kelly said.
You've only been hit.
And you will get through this and you will recover and you will come back stronger than ever before.
Armed Forces are more compassionate than respectful
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
A hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black smokings stood up and applauded.
“The soldiers and female soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A high-ranking military officer on the gala, who was watched by the chief of staff and then chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were introduced like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know.
But it wasn't respect, really, it was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the heavy relationship between the military and the most distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are overwhelmed with praise for their victims.
But praise has its price, servants say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if the people in uniform were suffering.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
“But apparently the only way to help is to push us into the role of unhappy souls.”
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also realized that the anger that has struck the returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War has been far worse.
As a result, there are talks about compassion in silence and private between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, Colonel A.D. Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if a “furious, violent veteran is hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took on a high-ranking state post in Washington upon his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from the fight.
“When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it,” Cancian told his sons.
The lack of military ease is partly rooted in the lack of American interest in war.
Performances on the battlefield are rarely taken as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely common during World War II,” said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a servant.
Troops find recognition for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, an important hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape in the military court.
If this is not done, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and pregnant in the 11th week when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was in October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she met a male colleague carrying a 12 pack of beer.
She asked him if he could take her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan woman put her concerns aside.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman’s room, the man stepped behind them, pushed them down and raped them, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously waiting for a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted to court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld have not taken action against the widespread rape within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs who, in the following months, rose to 28: 25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict, or provide appropriate jurisdiction according to the alleged attacks.
Burke says they are following the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
“The military is hierarchical,” she says.
"Who are the individual persons who are in the position to exterminate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, if necessary, they will file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Department team, led by State Attorney Neil MacBride, has filed a lawsuit to dismiss.
The court’s files, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Due to a 1950 Supreme Court law called the Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on active service soldiers.
“The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiff’s military service,” the document said.
The Department of Defense denies any comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her fight: three more complaints besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Independently, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is collecting a lawsuit against the military focusing on the “personality disorder” diagnosis that rape victims received to dismiss them from service – a common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women’s Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December accusing her of discriminatory practices in dealing with benefits claims for persons who claimed to have been sexually abused in service.
Nine laws were submitted to Congress independently by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
In 2010, according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Ministry of Defence, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported.
However, most abuses are not reported at all, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure accounts for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, published in March, also examines the law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases recorded in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman’s case, she reported the alleged military police rape less than an hour after the attack.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a number of police officers, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge, who asked her about the sex she had before the assault with her boyfriend.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I still remember the day the verdict was read,” says Lyman.
"I thought the labors would begin. I ran screaming out of the courtroom."
"They took me to the psychiatric department and I remember when I came out I said to my commander, 'That wasn't his procedure, that was my procedure.'"
Lyman was asked to visit a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably dismissed, so she received no support.
Whether the lawsuit Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he remarks, "in my opinion, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I am a critic of Feres doctrine.
The military is lagging a decade behind because they do not have the same incentive and deterrent that liability entails.
He adds, “The odds are against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the military in this regard until reforms are made,” she says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who broadcast their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed his first public hearing in a July shooting in Norway, killing 77 people.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time before his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It’s easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We found it wasn’t hard to come to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British idea factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook’s hiding of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the page’s advertising tool to accurately define their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy – just as marketers have for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their education, attitudes toward violence and their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 followers of 14 extremely right-wing parties in 11 European countries – without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a fairly new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of far-right groups are mostly young, male, and annoyed with immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more rational, democratic, and less violent than those who stay behind their computer screens.”
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to social trends such as in “likes”, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three content per day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers named this page in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study people through this page that you usually don’t reach on the street with your clipboard.
“If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them.”
“They had to inform the party first and it would never have allowed them to enter,” Bartlett says.
“With Facebook, it all falls away – you go straight to them.”
Others say the site offers a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full-blown frenzy on Facebook were significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent about this topic.
Moreno suggests that peer-to-peer students, such as residential advisors, monitor the site and help a student when posting too many status updates.
“You can’t solve a problem unless you’ve realized it,” said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno’s co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, the Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not otherwise have been found."
Facebook also constantly collects the data of its own people.
The site’s data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using data that only Facebook has access to – Master of Digital Freedom has long known that the site should make its big data fund available to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want to or not. To be able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you allow the site to provide its own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
“I don’t think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, to a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
“As far as she is concerned, it was only about her and her friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much of the information in a user profile and in posts is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
“There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research has to take care of the social – and a lot of social life is still taking place offline.”
'Cold and inhuman': Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who suffered two shootings in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo as a “resistance” fighter.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight of the Temple of Norway,” he said in a courtroom with more than 500 people.
“I appeal to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hassideologies and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I recognize the laws, but I do not confess guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, because he "did not want to give Breik to use this hearing as a platform on which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused permission for Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, to turn to the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, he said he would have no access to the media for four weeks, and the authorities would closely monitor all visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in hopes of seeing Breivik in the eyes, others wanted confirmation that he was staying behind lock and lock.
Everyone participated with the aim that everything would result in a closure.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told the Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was unpleasant, but for me, it goes a bit further after I’ve seen and heard the suspect.”
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing, looking journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik’s bizarre hint that he was part of a larger “resistance” movement, the judge concluded that he was not insane and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
It may please some that the July 22 attacks were apparently the work of a single extremist and not of a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
“I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn’t,” said one victim’s relative.
“It would be so much easier if he did.”
7 Lessons of Interview with Deceased Steve Jobs Shown at a Theatre This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the engineering genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans find perhaps the most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted this week before special film screenings in key markets, is how much this creative head has understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and self-appointed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer who was eager to craft charts -- a man who believed many executives were suffering from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph der Fachidioten" about the break-up of the personal computer, and he sat together for more than an hour with jobs in which they had one of the rare, detailed conversations.
By that time, more than 10 years had passed since jobs had been pushed out of Apple, and he was already working hard on his new computer company, NeXT, looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley’s interview was used in specialist idiots, he says the interview’s copy templates were missing on delivery.
It wasn’t until after Jobs’ death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director’s garage.
This slightly reworked footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which will be released on the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate detailed interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of meditation, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatiently responds to Cringely’s questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to topics or side-actions of greater importance.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, the Lost Interview somehow seems eerie far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies think are right or wrong and presents its own vision of the future of the computer.
It’s one thing to read posthumous appreciations of Jobs’ career, but seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer on the way to greatness is something completely different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all of this, he left and did it.
A quick look at seven remarkable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all the years in business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?". And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's made easy."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I found.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Stunned by how costs were recorded - usually started with "standard costs", which were quantified on the mere assumption and then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined down to the smallest.
How the pope became obsolete:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that could be used to sneak into the telephone company and conduct long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Job’s enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
“We sent things half a dozen times around the globe and when you screamed into the phone, it came out a minute later in the phone next door,” Jobs says.
“We were young and we learned that we can build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both didn’t know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don’t think there would be any Apple without it.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the pope while they were able to do the best they could to imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself came on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the first desktop computer ever made.”
He was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with brownish tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he was installing some boards, he was asked by a client to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment deadline of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and the delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember piercing arguments... they yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, which was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slowing down:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the paths that so many industrial giants stumbled upon with their visions and lost control of their stocks.
“Say you’re working at IBM or Xerox, so you’re doing a better copier or printer, so what?”
You own the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [those people] are ultimately running the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision making.
The product genius that has led to this monopoly position is eliminated by people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This happened with Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if it had been Microsoft in the 1990s.
You got the defeat of victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things that you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it comes down to the taste, it comes down to trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created and then trying to bring those things together to make what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn’t been the computer industry, they’d be doing fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas Dinner with Opponents of Health Laws as Court Takes Case
On the day the Supreme Court gathered behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether to hear a challenge to President Obama’s health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm to represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit brought by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became the buzzword among conservative activists across the U.S.
The judges agreed to the hearing, in fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is likely to fuel the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing when the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and claim that the law is to be overturned will probably be Paul Clement, once a Attorney General under George W. Bush’s administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, an old-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, who challenge the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is hugely involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court discussed the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the head of the Republican party in the Senate, and a declared opponent of health reform, served in the Senate.
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
This does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are freed from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in beneficiary events nearer to law and other organizations, whereby the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alert morale and government activists.
“This astonishing break with morality and the contradiction to the code penalizes the lawsuits of some judges, the court follows the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US, said in a statement.
"The judges won and dined during a beneficiary event with lawyers with hanging trials at the court."
Their appearance and support of a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they are too easily mixing court matters with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist society.
And Thomas's wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservatives claim that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was an attorney general under the Obama administration when the first lawsuits came to trial in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw from hearing the case for bias, as she was too engaged in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan has no intention of doing so.
Boeing to land a record $18 trillion order
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine aircraft with an option for 20 more aircraft.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a business worth more than $1 trillion.
It’s really rare news that a company gets an order for over 50 pieces of its products.
But it’s a big deal if the company is Boeing Co. and the list price for these 50 planes totals a record $18 trillion.
The client of Boeing is just as unusual: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order of all time for commercial aircraft this weekend, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-speed Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has an option to purchase another 20 aircraft, according to Boeing at the 2011 Dubai Aviation Show, which raises the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which greatly improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these planes is more than $1 trillion.
“This is absolutely positive for Boeing,” said Neal Dihora, Morningstar’s stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not as damaging as the country earns at a higher oil price.
This is important as they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have a natural hedge,” he said.
Emirates’ order confirms Boeing’s leadership in the wide-area aircraft market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS at bay, which is attacking the A350’s supremacy.
Boeing’s win at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350 directly competing with the 777-300ER.
The introduction was postponed to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing stocks rose by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug dealers have supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governor's post.
President Felipe Calderon’s sister apparently lost her job as governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections, claiming on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the governorship in the western state.
"The intervention of organised crime throughout the electoral process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after Sunday's election.
“They threatened our candidates, our poll staff ... they occupied ballot boxes, set up street blockades ... and commissioned people to vote [for the PRI].”
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in these efforts.
The PRI hopes for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have barely beaten Claderon, who had led in the polls before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother’s Conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently incumbent governor, came in third place, a severe defeat for the divided and unhappy left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies ties to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence continues.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have left the local elections for fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan may seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, “I think this victory will give us a bold look at next year.”
ADB urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) calls on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow down the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, administrator of the ADB based in Manila, said the two fastest-growing economic nations in the world must do “everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the currency block either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that are "passionless" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of European leadership and European resources by Asia helps to prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
“So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful,” he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some degree, but it is not immune.”
“If China and India can help, then by any means.”
Europe’s monetary union has been in serious debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s interest rates have increased dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The emerging serious debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into the recession and has led to calls for leading emerging economies to join forces to support the eurozone.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support from Asia by the IMF would be channelled, but said that mutual agreements – such as the purchase of EU bailout funds, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) – would offer greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian minister of commerce, said that “India will do everything in its power” to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from declining exports and the drying out of foreign capital flows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s an assignment, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no reason to help the rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult politically to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, of whom more than $800 million or even less per day are alive.
"At some point, they'll find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays on the beach, and then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India’s reserves should be used to keep in Greece the numerous and well-paid civil servants, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railroad.
Mr. Nag said that the crises in the eurozone will have “significant domino effects” on the whole of Asia.
The ADB forecast with an economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/ is now "risk of grading" due to the impending danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would need to create “crisis plans” to protect themselves from a downward trend and significant capital diversion of their wording.
Urgent Pentagon Warnings About Possible Reductions in Defence
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fueled Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would unnoticed weaken national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon’s halls to the war zones in Afghanistan and the civilian conveyor belts.
The Pentagon is already thinking through cuts of $450 trillion over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress can’t finalize spending.
“The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the ministry,” Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% general cuts and a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a thoughtless way, would make most of our ship and construction projects impracticable -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building -- and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from much of our civilian staff and, as the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would have to leave civilians with a certain probability of being able to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alertness.”
The cuts would ultimately hit the fighting forces,” Panetta said.
“While the wartime contingents in the anti-terrorist struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious interference in the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort,” Panetta warned.
"Personnel hiring has been cut, which would lead to delays in hiring and hiring oversight that support the war."
Staff salaries would be cut, resulting in late payments to wartime traders, and legal and political support would be disrupted.”
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequences of a confiscation by the Department of Defense would trigger a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panetta’s letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and it's certainly not that we should be forced."
“The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their entry should not be allowed.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and the new senators’ warnings will increase the pressure on a budget compromise or increase demands to exclude the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly expressed the potential cuts, though he has many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a gloomy picture of what might be imminent – a military with shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without sufficiently trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of fulfilling the mission,” Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to deal with potential opponents.”
“She really makes you angry.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions create “significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious restrictions on our global deployment and aggression, leading to an unacceptable risk in future war operations.”
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the deletion, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping the F35’s further development and testing would save up to $80 trillion in the next 10 years, but proponents say it’s an important next step to arming up so that potential dangers from China and other adversaries can be eliminated.
How to Debunk a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how worrying and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
The Republican presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is busy mastering the allegations of sexual harassment by several women, both of whom are accusing each other of lying.
Penn State’s leadership is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused a boy.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitor Anthony Weidner was fooled when he circulated denials that were very quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that triggered President Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about cheating in school and at college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have given their students the exam answers so that they could stand well even in their performance checks.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
Studies show that we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
Many of these lies are considered to be lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing or "discovering lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, and this for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from a societal game like Sharades, in which the goal is to call out “Have yourself!”, uncovering a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that conducted far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most ancient myths about lying have been uncovered.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don’t always stutter, stem, blush, and fidge.
However, it should not be inferred that these liars are difficult to uncover and uncover.
An experienced lie-debunker can penetrate to the truth by learning something about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years investigating the scientific results of the extensive and ever-growing field of debunking, and it is clear that uncovering a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to find our way in our complex world, especially if hiring or questioning people or negotiating or administration is one of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at appraising other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions, and they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to the research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts that men are more likely to appear to be “self-oriented” lies than women whose lies are more “oriented” – usually to protect the feelings of others – that married people are less likely to lie to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly “fat” lies).
We also know that when one person has been exposed as an offender, others feel less guilty about lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing that person’s normal behavior.
This is called baselining, the starting position.
It specifies a reference point for later evaluating changes.
Observe the attitude, laughter, voice quality of their subject.
You should know better when someone is usually constantly tripling their feet so they don’t wrongly accuse them if they triple their feet during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Think of these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of unmasking.
People who are fooling may be frozen when they try to remember their story. Maybe their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way, or show a "relaxation after the hiring conversation," this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in attitude when all the hard questions are over.
Askers often erroneously signal that a recruitment interview is over just to keep an eye out for that relaxation after the recruitment interview.
Also, pay attention to your subject’s language.
Scott Peterson’s slip-out is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his dead wife was still alive and triggered a national search for her.
Deceiving people can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question in general.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as far as I know... to the best of my knowledge and conscience."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, often causing the alarm bells to ring.
There is no magic to unmask lies, but you can learn skills that make unmask possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become less likely to fall victim to scammers, both in private and professional life.
Controversial Plan of an Oil Pipeline Reworked After Endangered by Delayed U.S. Authorization
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering the trade unions and at the same time reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline-building companies are making an effort to replan the project so that they can return to normalcy.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills to Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Parliament building in Nebraska.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit with a different course.
This came after an announcement by the State Department last week that a decision on federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was checked, which would avoid the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
“This is a real step forward,” Republican Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may postpone a decision until 2013, after next year’s election, even though officials deny that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said last week in a written statement that the decision was a foreign ministry task and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connecting Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
The pipeline would have to cross six countries.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline creates 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska’s lawmakers, who are against the plan, are weighing the laws to force a departure from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The latest study on the State Department’s environmental impact found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry says the ministry’s chief auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process that focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice as it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle accused of allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit
A New York family claims that the disco diva Patti LaBelle in the lobby of her Manhattan building had a tob addiction attack that would have scared her little daughter so much that she surrendered in fear.
The tirade of the “Lady Marmalade” singer scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered from “personality changes, sleep disorder” and “an increased fear of strangers,” her family told the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on November 10 last year that stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergartener, and Genevieve wanted to set off for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went with the luggage and Genevieve on her arm to the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to take her back on her arm," she said.
LaBelle exhorted the pregnant woman.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t drop your daughter off near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and began to scold - she used the F-word and the A-word and became very loud.
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started tipping water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
“I said to this woman, ‘Look what you did to my daughter,’” said the child’s mother.
LaBelle plunged onto the mother, who was still wearing Genevieve on her arm, and had to be restrained from her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to surrender, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for a statement.
The lawsuit is on an unspecified compensation, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he will not charge a fee and plan the family to donate the money they receive to child cancer aid.
“We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior,” Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially if it is shown to a kindergartener wearing an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climate constraints slowed the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and black work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in Sinaloa’s economic history. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and fueled great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, due to the climatic adversities, growth cannot be spoken of, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused million-dollar losses in agriculture, but also limited the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter, mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a decelerating effect on other economic sectors.
According to a report published by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582 000 hectares of agricultural land have been damaged, 78.03 percent of which have been completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent have been partially destroyed.
The decline in economic activity until November has steadily increased unemployment in the Mexican state. In the first quarter of the year, the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia observed a rapid increase in unemployment, since from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent in the following quarter, and from July to September.
Lower liquidity
The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments, the policy of public institutions indirectly explains the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts in funds passed by legislation to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who are illegally accumulating dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, invest them, or use them for anything else," he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that the growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, especially in the United States, has decreased. This is due on the one hand to the problems of entry and on the other hand because it is difficult to find work there too. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Blackwork
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious if you take into account the high proportion of black work, which, according to INEGI, includes 60.38 percent of workers in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
Unemployment and undeclared labour are the lowest wages in all of Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Security Institute) and the Secretaria del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Office for Labour and Social Welfare in Mexico).
By September, the average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos, much less than the general government average of 7375 pesos.
Decrease in ADI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and growing unemployment, the strongest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years was recorded in 2011, according to the Secretarial Office of Economia (State Economic Authority), the ADI was $ 630 597 from January to June, representing a drop of 87.74 percent compared to the $ 5,143 312 in the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the Secretaria de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Governmental Authority for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from tertiary companies.
The debt
In the light of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities in order to reactivate the economy.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé's incapacity manifest.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing in Mexico), stated that no efforts were made in 2011 to harmonise the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa has been really poor this year, and we need to work hard to regain the land lost this year, and we need to double our efforts in 2012. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year made the country’s economic development more difficult and slowed down.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including the frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowdown in the economy, which is not sufficiently moving to create an economic dynamic that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services, so we will close the year well below our expectations," he said.
redefine the vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la Repáblica Mexicana in Sinaloa, said that the state should be encouraged to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that work has been done. We believe it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the country's economic vocation and line, because it is important to activate all Sinaloa's material and human resources," he said.
There is much to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that will guide the government’s efforts in better direction.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power has made progress in government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively, and what I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrested for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days sentences for owning eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic’s public prosecutor’s office announced that the drug retailer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a public health offense – here the commercial possession of marijuana.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military personnel during the surveillance of the Cipriano Valdez road opposite the guard post No. 80 in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug retailer drove in a white van storing a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the punished person is still in the prison.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Páblicos and 3x1 programs run the risk of not being completed due to lack of funds or only with a great delay, said Miguel Angel López Miranda.
The head of the Urban Social Development Authority stated that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger, as the state government has not paid the funds it owes, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to almost 50 million pesos, of which 25 percent fell to the state, and so far only the Federación and the municipality have contributed funds to the construction work, so a delay in the construction termination is expected.
"Twelve million they have to contribute, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, and that even though they should have paid us a portion in July," he said. "To be not too late, we have already begun the construction work, and they are already far advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state had failed to meet its obligations, so the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign, equivalent to the amount that the central government would have had to raise.
"We had already done this in the last legislature, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programs," he said.
Even though the state authorities were obliged to pay out these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance had been requested to speed up the administrative work and pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
“They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny.”
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The changeover from analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuits filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, under which the switch from analogue to digital signals from 2021 to 2015 must be moved, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, felt that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his responsibilities when he issued the legislative decree detailing the switch to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute created by the Senate, because it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes for the court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality.
In the project for the lawsuit, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, since the regulations relating to radio and television would be subject to the Commission Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the decree would contradict the hierarchical principles and laws.
In favor of the project, only Zaldivar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After accepting the lawsuits, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to set up the digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the lawsuit filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed his disagreement with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the country government may not regulate with general rules the measures that the public administration should take.
"I also don't think that doing so would affect the independence of the regulatory body," she recalled, "that the central government is responsible for planning strategic policies, such as the telecommunications sector, for constitutional reasons, because it is the central government that is in charge of state affairs.
Replacing analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it brings about better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, is a postponement of the exploitation of digitization, which is a decision in the public interest, which has not only technical aspects, "because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the action of the entire system, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that the constitution puts in the hands of the central government."
It recalled that many countries around the world had already implemented the digital transformation, namely the government, despite having highly specialized facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government would intervene in the competences of Congress with the publication of the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with,” she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the election of the governor is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of individual counting of the ballots is a reality in the Michoacán elections this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governoral elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
With this in mind, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last November 9th, the electoral office had adopted a series of regulations to harmonise local regulations with state reforms in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his electoral law or his law on electoral justice to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they did not enter into force at this round of elections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional lawsuit filed by the local legislature and judged the state commissioner’s vote on the constitutional reforms as “invalid and unlawful” as he did not have the right to “decline or veto it.”
In an interview on the possibility of individual counting of the votes, Maria de los Angeles Llanderal said that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there was now a possibility that the local electoral authority could partially or completely count the ballots.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted The results in the minutes are not in agreement; the minutes on the counting and calculation of votes are not in fact available or are not in possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the fully completed ballots can take place if there is a difference between the suspected winner and the one standing in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an explicit request from the party or coalition chairman, who is the second of the named candidates.
The counting of votes may also take place in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the suspected winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that an explicit request is made by a representative of the party whose candidate has become second, in which case the election packages that have been subjected to a partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth noting that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second places is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés settled on Saltillo, his birthplace, this Sunday evening.
According to family members, the lieutenant's last will was that his ashes be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a ceremony, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila, along with the others who died in the crash, in an airplane of the Mexican Air Force.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel landed on the mourning hall, which is located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came.
At 5.30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Institute of Technology of Saltillo, which was initiated by his former classmates from the technical high school and his American football team, to whom Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and to have his ashes spread over the Zapalinamé Mountains, which he had always told his family and friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister, said in a statement.
From her point of view, the Lieutenant-Colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn’t believe it because they thought it would even make him dizzy on a truck, yet he was always striving to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good man. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and the whole family wanted to welcome him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagan to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even at the age of seven, he had traveled to Zapopán to graduate his family member, so he knows that his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
One last goodbye
Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Bacio Cortés of the Mexican Air Force was honored by the people and government, the Mexican army of the Sixth Military Territory, the Mexican Air Force, headmasters and students of the Saltillo Technological Education Institute, where he studied in 1985 and was outstanding in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, which also included Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority, crashed.
At 6.05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the courtyard of the barracks, where he was already awaited by his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives.
The abandoned bodies were found on a property at Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the finding, military personnel presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with the organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different body parts and a grace shot in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at kilometer point 1.5 of the highway from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several temporary residents saw that the door of the country house surrounded by a beige-brown wall stood open.
As they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately informed the competent authorities.
One wore a yellow t-shirt and dark pants, without shoes; beside him lay another, dressed in a white top.
Almost a meter away lay another person’s body with a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to the information received locally, the three people must have been murdered in another place, as no cartridge sleeves were found.
On the wall of the country house are inscriptions written by an organized gang of criminals to another, and several shots have been found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretariat of Defensa Nacional presented 11 people, including a minor who was part of a gang of criminals working mainly in the town of Cadereyta, who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human hunting) and secret funerals.
According to public information, eight people were arrested and one prisoner was released in the settlement of Los Alveros on November 11.
Three properties and a cell phone were secured, and the detainees confirmed they were members of the "Los Zetas" criminal group.
On November 12, at 6 a.m., military personnel found a car with two occupants on their watch in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
During the inspection of the car, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are charged with secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Formation of the new Italian government on Wednesday
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government that is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, meets with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government that is to face the crisis that has led Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the Presidential Palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is assumed that he will present a cabinet composed of a majority of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on government formation.
“I would like to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country’s ability to cope with these difficult times,” the former EU Commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “frame is now well laid out,” he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of debt to an unbearable level.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by Europolitics to regain the weakened confidence in Italy.
The pressure on Monti to be in a hurry was intensified by the fluctuating market situation as a result of which Italian government bonds were charged with 7 percent interest for 10 years, in line with the situation in which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industrial association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would do our best to support this government."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were significantly increased with the support of the PDL party of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
“We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to bring about good results,” said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, the largest party in Italy, is essential, because so far many of its members have opposed a government made up of a majority of technocrats, which is currently forming Monti.
Support from Parliament
The new Monti government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the probably unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to its efforts or delaying reforms could once again cause a devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks also puts pressure on Monti’s failure to act as a disaster.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as with youth and women’s organisations.
The session will be closed on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who initiated an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short breathing at the end of last week, when it became known that Berlusconi would resign, as a result of uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister, the costs of Italian government bonds have again reached critical limits.
Saving Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU bailout.
Monti said his government should last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite the predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than prefer the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this should only be made up of technicians, an indication of their concerns in the face of the process imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the involvement of people from political life.
Spaniards have more gambling opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten have over 50 international games on the brink.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convened has played 50 games.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries are compared for the friendly match that takes place today at 3:05 p.m. at the San José National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, the number one on FIFA’s monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A selection games, the three-coloured team has only the defense player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) in Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Star League) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have every year the opportunity to participate in numerous home matches (liga and cup championships) as well as high-ranking European cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, experience with the Spanish fury in complicated extinction matches at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA ranking.
We will see how the Spanish team draws their last record: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will set a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team who had reached the magical number 100: the cited Zubizarreta with 126 and Schalke’s mid-stroke, Raul González, with 102.
The number Hundred is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are left-wing striker Jonior Diaz with 48 games and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From there, only five came on over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Less than 30 games have been played by Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come fewer than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn’t even close to the 20’s.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba has two, recorded in Costa Rica, only one and Alman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debut.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 hits, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band reassures that a dream come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was assured by bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they perform at the National Stadium from 7:30 p.m. with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation, the full copy of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true for us.
This is just the second time we’ve played in South and Central America, and so far it’s been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for a holiday. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It’s exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert most intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for being by our side all these years.
We took almost 21 years to come to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken this long to come here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn’t that put a little pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We played a couple of gigantic shows in Sao Paulo and we hope they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we want to play there.
We love this country, we love surfing and are thrilled by the jungle. For this, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are simply unimaginable.
My friends have always gone surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, we learned about people who love surfing.
With a view to the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there, we don’t set any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and everyone likes a different song, so the decision we’re going to make isn’t easy.
If we include two or three songs that we have not played in a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs, otherwise they could be forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and I think that’s why it’s also interesting for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty-year history.
When you look back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined playing in a great rock band for more than 20 years.
We also continue to rely on this blessing and it is great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are excited to produce music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't stand better.
What did it mean for you to participate actively in the birth of the Grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement comes out of a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from a city, but it is unusual for five or ten groups to come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We are still happy to be friends with all of them and it honors us to be part of this arose Seattle sound.
It’s also very unusual for a band like yours to stay together with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) came to us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I think we all value being alive and also we care about each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't get any better.
Your relationship to fame hasn't always been easy, but thanks to your success, you've always been able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it’s too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you think people have come for the music, it reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it created without being anxious to be a famous rock star.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and it was great in the beginning.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We are still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I listen to a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chose the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos from several groups and we liked this band best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That's sure to be exciting.
Why do you change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter every time you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
From so many+
The first ones I can think of include Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bassists I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it was no longer a fad?
I think we all don’t feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time, and if they are still important today, I think it’s great because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first her music was darker, now she is more positive.
Why?
That’s interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit light-hearted, but there are other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about themselves.
Both of them came to my tears when I heard Ed playing them. They are very dark songs.
I think when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life -- for example, when you lose a family member or a friend -- it clearly affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs embody it for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori returned to hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was taken to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several diseases, including tongue cancer, which is operated and controlled four times.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian Hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body members.
Aguinaga commented that he believed Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons, but he did not want to do so because he thought he was innocent.
He has been operated on four times for tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos in weight, including other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs.
Fujimori has been held at the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la Policia since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army death squad, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday, which will be the culmination of his busy schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the Uruguayan president.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking support from Calderón for the incident with France, when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still act as tax havens, which was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request from his ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been presiding over the G20, a group of the most powerful emerging and industrialized countries in the world, since November, and an agreement has been in place to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation with the South American country since January of this year.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has attempted to accelerate the concretisation of agreements for the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which includes countries that have not implemented all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
On a business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The snoring installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but so far he has never been in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the shop counters all over the world this month, has been tailored from the start to the features of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which can be played three-dimensionally without a special pair of glasses.
“Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses,” said Omar Alvarez, who is in charge of the Nintendo-specialized press in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
"Super Mario 3D Land is Nintendo's first video game to be developed for this console from the very beginning, because hit articles like Star Fox 64 3D or Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D have been adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo’s spokesman underlined that while it’s three-dimensional, “Super Mario 3D Land” is an “affordable” video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
Alvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: The first part is "easy" to capture the less skilled users.
After that, the experts can turn a "second round" over the different levels of the game, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. To overcome the obstacles without being a victim of the "optical effects", however, it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
This trip of Super Mario into the three-dimensional world also means the character’s return to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of recent editions: The snoring installer must overcome dangerous platforms to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news about the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees delivery of Portillos to the United States
Guatemala’s president, Alvaro Colom, announced Tuesday that he would allow the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to be held responsible in the United States for the $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
This is how the trial ends with the U.S. request for extradition of Portillo so that it can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed his decision was based on independence from justice and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his reign he did not interfere in court decisions and accepted all extradition requests that he was notified of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin is extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s action is a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional authorities have been exhausted to convict the former President of the State (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemale is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for undermining 120 million quetzals in the Ministry of Defence during his reign, which was preceded by extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the life of Trinijove have led to important results: In this quarter century, 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion were supported in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event took place yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which more than 300 people took part.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of education, without work, with drug problems that were at risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous representatives of institutions and institutions who have worked with the association for 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions at election times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
Apart from the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol participated in the celebrations of former socialist education minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current left-green city councilor Ricard Goma.
The large hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Llu's Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stressed that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today’s times are no less complicated, but he added that the work done so far “is a good foundation”.
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinijove is an example that knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives people in difficulty hope.
“The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does,” he said.
Occupied house where giant parties were held was cleared
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes No. 51 (Barcelona).
The twelve occupiers left the building last afternoon without any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 on the street Balmes have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building, which they had illegally occupied, and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair.
After the evacuation, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
“From now on, access will be checked,” the house manager confirmed.
The occupiers who had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply, and they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
On the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated that lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the start of the occupation.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the occupiers were unfairly competing with her, because they sold the drinks at three euros, while in the discotheque they cost 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had been reported by the neighbors for rest disturbance, while according to her statement the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the house occupiers and especially from the guests of the festivals that were organized there, and which according to the angry neighbors in recent weeks became more and longer.
Discotheque officials said the harassment was so great that they agreed with the owner of the building not to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (city police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from its neighbors in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the city council of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Diaz, had demanded last week to clear the building immediately and to get to grips with the problems of civic coexistence and the downfall of the neighborhood.
He explained that only one floor of the building had been occupied before the summer, but that the occupiers had penetrated all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments in recent months.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and take action against the antisocial acts in the building."
Yesterday another building in the Nou Barris district was cleared by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached Montral No. 35 after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people penetrate the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree to the tender.
The municipal tender for the 16 goals reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its disgrace paper on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It was even compared in numbers to the Central Park of New York.
With the fall of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper boundary of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that spreads not in the north-south direction, but upwards (mountains) and downwards (sea).
The classification of Collserolas as a nature park plays with this idea.
The model was no longer the Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear.
So far, in September, the city issued a huge tender, consisting of 16 competitions, for further entrance gates to Collserola.
Without a doubt, a gate points to the concept of a park.
Either that’s the case, or someone is planning to set goals in the country.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, Park or Mountain?
The call for proposals is not only from an organisational point of view, but also with a view to a reflection on the city, the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this old caste, who meet in the elevator, can resort to.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the material for one of the rare matches between what three Barcelona architects think about it and some university professors who applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to talk about the "front of the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who is over the green apples, has not been held.
"One should assume the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Tore of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one must not imagine it "as entrances to a park, but as the confines of areas where action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban planning experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that involves "some dangers".
Hazards arising from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings today" following the experiences from the 1980s, which had their "tail singing" in the field of the forum.
The first concern is to limit yourself to what can be built.
“Restricting something always means setting the next step,” i.e., exceeding it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is closer to the question, simplifies that the side of Collserola, which goes in the direction of Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not go in the direction of Barcelona", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronate de Collserola that should not "stood on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving his body the opportunity to participate in this project "from the very first moment."
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the guide letter that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubt" as to whether this technical profile should lead the created multidisciplinary teams ("exactly the right one," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex, as Collserola lacks a global view in the tendering conditions: "There have been 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the mountain sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety."
At least in his case, this led him to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is located directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length in such a way that a soft transition between the city and the green zones is created.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, Casino Red’s representative freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the Casino Red’s representative pardons him before the Second Criminal Tribunal of the District, which runs the trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the assassination of Casino Royale, Sergio Gil Garcia, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money for the city administration to approve the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal charge, the prosecutor opened a criminal case against the brother of the panist mayor, who was arrested on September 2 for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Péblico 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He stayed there 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Pablico dismissed the crimes for bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta detention centre for allegedly stealing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos, while he remained in the middle security wing for only a few hours because of threats of murder against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as the inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, Jorge Yánez, the secretary of the District’s Second Criminal Tribunal, issued an arrest order, stating that after the nearly two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence to plead guilty to Jonás for paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in order to open it in return.
On Monday, Casino Red’s authorized representative, Mr. Aldo Garcia Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina, the mayor’s brother, to release him in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the court-appointed Ministerio P’blico, Garcia Gómez, asked whether he had corrected the damage and which of the owners of the betting house had forgiven him, but the lawyer withheld the name.
In accordance with Case 197/2011 Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted and no objections can be raised to the proceedings and no compensation is required.
After hearing the representative of the betting house around 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case would be filed.
He also informed him of the judicial order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announced details of the plane crash in which Secretary of the Government Francisco Blake and seven others were killed.
SCT (Mexico’s Secretariat of Communications and Transportation) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident, which killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people, indicate that the helicopter with its entire intact structure was directly bounced to the ground without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, said that the pilot had confirmed before launch that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller wing was in contact with trees at 25 meters altitude, with the helicopter losing the fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had had several ground contacts."
He also stated that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for transporting the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had crashed.
"In the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the impact was on the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has an inclination of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but it can take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, Director General of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat of Aircraft and Auxiliary Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at a speed of travel and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of sight flight, which means that the crew should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start, and during the flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some deep-hanging clouds arose.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the team had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar record of the helicopter are consistent, and there may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Dispersion of the remnants of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to the present time indicates that the helicopter had bounced in a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered aircraft remains suggest that the helicopter with its intact structure had impacted the ground.
No signs of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the site of the accident do not indicate fire or explosion.
The latest research results indicate several ground contacts.
In the field investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level. The terrain is bulging and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter is likely to have broken.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a minute search in an area that went beyond the locked area at the site of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, which reinforces the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had bounced against the ground.
MSS Announces Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
She heads a research project to find the gene for obesity in children and adolescents, which is supported by IPN specialists.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Mexico's Social Insurance Institute) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents under the title "Genetics of childhood and youth obesity" to find the genetic markers associated with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquimica (Department of Medical Research, focus on Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was set up.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate course at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Peblica (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are conducted every Saturday from 8.00 am.
He stressed that the investigation began on the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of México) and has continued since 8 October on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
Once the target of 500 to 600 investigators has been reached, the study will be continued on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to get to know the factors and the role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the global day of diabetes, he stated that it is intended that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill out nutritional questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history of disease to control risk factors that could result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He also stated that on those Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure controlled and blood levels such as glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (trying to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be carried out on the occasion of health workers’ concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 showed that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent, and obesity also increased dramatically," said the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He stated that on average, a Mexican is 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of the energy we consume (calories) so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the study participants would be a comprehensive examination of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of obesity or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin wrinkles in the neck and inner arm (acanthesis), indicating the likelihood of metabolic disorders and pre-stage diabetes.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to the parents all the measurement results and propose to them lifestyle changes that are appropriate for the prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for obesity, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport, instead of short distances walking.
The high calorie intake, i.e. an increased consumption of sugared beverages and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) along with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
UNAM asphalt prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, Researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If the signs emanating from the road surface were observed, it would not be necessary to repair nearly 200,000 potholes if the rainy season in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (Valley of Mexico) erupted, Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, said, cautioning and even insuring that the pothole count would be significantly reduced.
In his lecture, "Trackholes from a technical point of view", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing polymer-modified asphalts to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behavior of the road surface, thus avoiding the appearance of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalts - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes.
Toughening-elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180° C., at 120° C. it is very viscous and almost solid at 50° C., while it becomes fragile at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer said.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly have flexible road surfaces, which consist of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers is a layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single piece of this layer of wear was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
“If it were modified asphalt, the forces would spread even better,” said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
Those of this road surface that receives and distributes the most forces, the support layer also needs a suitable thickness and the material it is made of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially the water, because it significantly impairs the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes moist, water enters the layer and exits only with difficulty. This causes softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a impact hole is formed, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards, but the damage is not immediately caused, but it is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (Mexico’s National Research System) stated that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of impact holes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be proportional to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent impact holes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle lack to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that impacted Melina Ramirez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets its 14th Miss title.
Once again, Valle del Cauca left empty when awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle for being on the winning podium, showing off a silver crown and the band that identifies her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result received this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department is already on 14 Miss titles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca (1947).
The big question that many ask themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the demise of a great favorite who had shown at each screening that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. Not for nothing she had been elected Queen of the Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received, and who took home the crown of the Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial to the jury’s decision to nominate her as First Miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question “Which book has influenced you the most and why?” which Martan Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos had asked her.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in literature, I believe it’s a way of civilizing myself, ultimately I believe that the book that shaped my childhood most is ‘The Little Prince’, a pretty deep book.
I am currently reading Guilt and Atonement. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian woman, a beautiful book called Passion.
A response that encountered little love for it, firstly because of the concept of ‘civilizing’ and secondly because it had not explained in detail how each book it mentioned had influenced her.
But after the ceremony ended, Melina declared that she felt calm and happy with the result: “The universe is wise, it happens what needs to happen.
And for all people, please read a little ‘The Little Prince’. It’s a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the favorite of El Valle has burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the preferred one, who received all the applause and who had received all the awards in advance (Gastronomy Competition Easter, Audience Vote on the Best Handmade Costume and Reina Madre), "had made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who could not shine on stage."
And that was noticeable at her first performance in the swimsuit on the beach at the Hilton hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she certainly performed in both, she lacked the strength and the momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for RCN’s “Como en casa” program, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss “shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition does not eventually become Queen.”
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury of their interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
There will be reason for it that two days before the international jury put together, Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone isn't enough for a Miss Colombia, but you have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling that she had already worked on projects before taking part in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of the derrier and fibrosis, which were noted in the stomach area, but that is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for ‘natural beauty’ with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn’t have the best body, that there was better, “but her problem with fibrosis on the stomach, which frankly was barely noticeable to me, pushed her score on the last day.”
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgery she had undergone.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to get her to do them right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and she had to pay for this job.”
Because of this award, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction arose after the appearance in the swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo Melina had given a consolation prize to not let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that’s true or not, the fact is that Melina will start her reign from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions at the appointment of the National Beauty Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens, who had escaped the crown despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
A lophoscopicist from Cali went into history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4, a lophoscopicist of the Cali State Prosecutor’s Investigation Unit (CTI) as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) entered: “Alfonso Cano” by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopicists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had on-call service, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to Valle over and after completing the necessary courses he specialized in Lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin that is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of the campaign against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he should identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one could be that of the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he should take along Guillermo León Sáenz’s 10-finger print sheet (his real name).
However, when he reached the location where the body was, he could not identify it because of its physical appearance, for this was not in the least similar to the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer in the area, was not wearing glasses and was much thinner.
Fingerprints do not lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the imprint sheet.
He said it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, this Puerto Tejada man was in charge of informing the Defense Minister, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
On track search
For a dactyloscope from Sijin in Cali, the appreciation given by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the campaign against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopicists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When they are arrested, many offenders present false identity documents or they do not have one.
We take the fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house in the event of a theft, because the thief had supported himself with his hand right here when he pulled out a safe stuffed with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are inappropriate for taking fingerprints, but in this case we were able to take the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be relieved or burdened.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
In the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be suspicious, and in fact a fingerprint on the bottle agreed.
Although this does not guarantee that the killer is involved, he is still associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that “the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object.”
When they appear, a planting cell or band is used to take them with you.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil registry office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers," the CTI expert explained.
He said not everything was the way it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold is what shines, not all you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a comparison.
The “Disgruntled” Challenge New York Authorities
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in tents on Zuccotti Square.
Much of it followed the eviction order and changed its location to a nearby park.
On Tuesday, members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities as they tried again with a court order to enter Manhattan Square after being cleared of the square at dawn and trying to occupy another place at the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, to which they sought access with a court order allowing the "embarrassed" to camp again at this site. Meanwhile, another part of the movement clung to the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests occurred.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the pitch, we will meet in another place and continue the battle with legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray stated that the “outrages”’ response to the eviction of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent eviction of the square and authorizing the demonstrators to camp.
In addition, the "embarrassed" occupied a new park located at the intersection of centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, which is owned by Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact numbers. He assured the news agency Efe that he had seen several journalists with handcuffs among them.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have arrived at this place, where also a delegation of religious leaders had arrived as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing scheduled for this Tuesday, in which the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn will be analyzed.
Some of the square-driven protesters carried and distributed photocopies of this court order, even giving them to some police officers who guarded the square, resulting in "a few small clashes," Bray reported, who reported that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order forbids the authorities to remove members of Occupy Wall Street from the court, as well as the application of “laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the demonstrators from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg made it clear to the press that this court order had lifted the reopening of the square for the public and the demonstrators, pointing out to the protesters that the city laws did not allow them to re-establish themselves with tents and sleeping bags at the site.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square at dawn, where nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violate the law."
Bloomberg said he gave the order to clear the square because it had “turned into a place where people didn’t come to demonstrate, but to break the laws, and in some cases to harm other people,” because “some deals had received threats” and residents were “fearful of their quality of life.”
“The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests and not protecting the interests of North American workers,” the movement’s spokesman added, accusing the mayor of “not respecting the freedom of the press.”
Occupy Wall Street officials said they thought about organizing “great actions” for Thursday, along with community organizations and trade unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have been going on since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary on the Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on December 1st on the TV show It's a Russell Peters Christmas.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", lifeguard in "Baywatch", rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Canadian television Christmas show.
Private TV channel CTV today announced that Anderson, along with the "crooner" Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will perform on December 1 in the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and breathe life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson - also for the dissemination on the Internet of a self-made porn, in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - appears as Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American origin, who recently worked as a presenter on Charlie Sheen’s “My Violent Torpedo of Truth,” appears as a Jesus Child.
CTV’s Christmas program not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far away from this controversy.
At one of his concerts in New York, Bublé recently referred to North American Kim Kardashian as “Hure.”
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the free fall spiral from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the destructive earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis and the worst catastrophe Japan had experienced during World War II.
The government’s initial estimates in Tokyo estimated the damage to property at $300,000, a blow that seems to be attenuating despite the difficult global economic situation.
After three quarters, gross domestic product data from July to September finally closed this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year ratio.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be explained in part by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decrease for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real shift in the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynesian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - has moved into one of the "refugee currencies" of investors fleeing from the eurozone's debt crisis and bleak forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that bears a tombstone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, the products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the listing of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
“We need to pay attention to the ongoing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid upgrading of the yen,” said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very uplifting.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator predicting the turning points of the global economy showed that the brakes on the biggest economic potentials had been pulled.
Because he dropped by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which is 100 after falling by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be passed, but the conservatives will not sign a written agreement
With the increased risk premiums of peripheral countries and widening insecurity, Greece continues to get lost in the labyrinth that emerges from the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the “consensus” of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a real conviction of the political forces is slowly confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there are no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one hundred days agreed upon at his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and by no means withdraw his demand for new elections on the scheduled date, February 19.
“The most important task of this government is the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October,” Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate, which will reach its peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara’s statement does not cast doubt on his position: “We have committed to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else.”
The conservative leader took a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens desperately needs, and made it clear that he would not endorse a declaration of commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still annoyed by the impact of the Papandreu referendum poker game, reiterated yesterday that its demand would not be shaken: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties “did not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible”.
Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman for the Ministry of Economic Affairs, said the Troika’s inspectors would come back to Athens “very soon” to discuss with the new government “what is needed for the payment of the sixth section” in the amount of 8,000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek knuckle still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "dominant" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing.
“Spain has achieved a dominant position in the role of microfinance worldwide.”
The Queen of Spain reminded yesterday that in the last two decades, Spain has become the second donor of this means of international cooperation worldwide, based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all mankind on the basis of trust in man".
The Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that there was “no doubt” that these types of business would be “absolutely essential” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and “especially the goal of limiting the number of people living with incomes of less than one dollar a day.”
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is doing this task responsibly," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions from the summit, which will last until Thursday, "will guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We've seen a lot of successes and we're facing many challenges."
The microcredit summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for pushing "two fundamental goals".
The Queen said it would aim for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 10 million of these households to cross the poverty line.
The conception of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus “years ago,” which Queen Sofia judges as an “act of justice and recognition.”
She described the father of this financial instrument as an “admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty” and whose work she has known for 15 years when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to learn about the local loan strategy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings on the Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we have been able to observe a continuous development," said the Queen, whose commitment to this project earned her yesterday's assessment as "the head of the family" in Valladolid and as "the spokeswoman for the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her talk by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Commandment"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is “an ethical precept” for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to bind development aid at times of economic boom, because it was a “permanent commitment”.
Jiménez felt that micro-credit is a “serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty” and that the governments of industrialized countries must now work “more than ever” according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the most important forms of development aid.
State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, lamented "the success", "marginalised" people who "always stand in front of closed doors" to give "hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the people present in a city that "opens their doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU President on the basis of general voting
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig) was without any real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and Chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, especially in order to satisfy those activists who consider government policy on the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The European Commission’s proposed Presidency proposal was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against, and ten abstained.
The standing ovation, which lasted for several minutes, which was due to their intervention decisions at first to Angela Merkel and a few hours later to Wolfgang Schäuble, was “no doubt open on the part of the three European-accepted finance ministers.
The main idea of the Chancellor, like the motions, bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro.
For the chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could be reflected in a modification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which strengthens the control of the European Union, with regard to the budgetary policies of the countries in the euro area, but could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a general vote "in order to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals adopted by Congress, to which Wolfgang Schäuble was clearly a godfather.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to it, and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is of the same opinion.
However, the milestone has been set.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weight each country on the ECB’s board of directors according to the weighting of individual economies, which obviously resulted in a strengthening of Germany’s position.
The chancellor, intent on calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "small" or in trouble, European countries, which would immediately criticize the arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the Europe request devotes a paragraph to the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France on the agenda.
At least not directly.
This reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the scam represent when it comes to sickness reports?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now tackling the sick reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday, 15 November, to visit a family fund and to present a speech on the topic of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on an effort to test the economy but, on the other hand, is no less forerunner of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee sickness reports.
First of all, with budgetary objectives: the government is aiming to introduce a fourth day of care before taking into account an illness report among employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the salary of four days, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income, without the approval of the specific company.
A measure that, according to the daily Le Echos, threatens to provoke anger, but would help raise 280 million euros.
And that would be accompanied by a different measure of rather symbolic character: to grant the state officials an unpaid caren day in the case of illness (so far, in contrast to the three caren days in the private sector, there is no caren period at all).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority are also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time aimed at the abuse associated with absenteeism at work.
“Controls will be much more important, and moreover, they will be reimbursed if demanded,” Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13 in front of RTL’s microphone.
As in other cases, the impact of this report on the reality of fraudulent actions in the field of sickness reports seems to be a little disproportionate.
Indeed, this has been the subject of continuous monitoring since 2002, as well as of political offensives, which have most often borne fruit.
The French are no more often ill than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first refer to the national figures.
According to the CNAM, more than 237 million euros were paid out in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of the health care sector, the day-to-day payments in 2008 accounted for 11.3 billion euros 5% of health expenditure.
This figure was 46% for maternity leave and occupational accidents and 54% for sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
That’s 2.5% of health care spending.
According to a study by the Alma Consulting Group, only 14.5 days of sickness were granted to the French in 2010, compared to the 17.8 days in 2009.
A mean value that covers up certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, a career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 surveyed French workers said they had not taken a single day of sickness.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of the disease reports in 2010 were shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months, and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers tend to be incapacitated.
A 2010 long-term study conducted by two researchers from the French State Center for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (health or otherwise justified) oscillated between 10% and 11% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Scams of sickness reports represent a substantively small proportion of black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak amount is achieved here.
The reinforcement of the legislation since 2002 means that there are sysmatic checks on disease reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, under 1.5 million controls, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term sickness reports realised, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
In the systematically monitored cases of more than 45 days, under 1.2 million cases were counted as 11% "unadjusted or unjustified", i.e. 132,000.
Overall, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases to several million workers who have claimed a sick report.
A number that represents only a weak outma’ compared to, for example, that of black work.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus significantly more than the fraud in the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece needs a new adjustment programme to intercept its economy.
This was announced by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos before Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to accomplish this task.
"To continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners, as well as a new budget adjustment programme," he said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October is the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation within the eurozone "is at stake", he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's national deficit "by 9%" of gross domestic product from today to the end of the year, after it was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had on Monday given his approval of the measures already approved regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but forwarded that his party would not be ready for an additional spart.
“We will not vote in favour of new measures,” he said at a congress of his party New Democracy.
He had agreed to reduce budget deficits and debts, as well as to fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would stop the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from releasing the necessary loan of €8 billion without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, had replied that his word would suffice and he would not sign anything under pressure from outsiders.
Euthanasia and accompanied free death must be legalized, according to an expert panel
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain relievers, including beyond cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they want to die and make dispositions for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing Royal Society of Canada report involving six experts linked to each other in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice arises, specifically for patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the world.
Although Canada has ranked 10th in this, the study notes that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to cut the topic of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority of Canadians wanting to die at home, 68.6% of those eventually die in hospital.
From a country-wide perspective, the rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of hospital deaths.
In the delicate question of euthanasia and accompanying suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already expressed no desire to make any changes to the criminal law on euthanasia and accompanying suicide.
However, according to the experts who have inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalisation would entail misuse in its application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide by incompetent or non-conforming persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such violations are encountered, especially in countries where euthanasia and accompanying suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Accompanied suicide is also practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here,” explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Recall that, according to an Angus-Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already emigrated in favor of euthanasia, as they believe it will allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not result in conveying the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are of less value.
In the case of those who have already practiced an accompanying suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as the maintenance or discontinuation of funds in patients is concerned, the situation becomes less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their recommendation list that the criminal law should state that the cessation of the funds for which there was a valid refusal should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the task of respecting a cessation of funds at the end of life, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, healthcare institutions and doctors worked together to provide the best pain relievers, including beyond cancer cases.
Finally, the panel calls for at least consideration of the pain relief or life-sustaining measures already widely used in the Canadian institutions of health care, since they were not used to reduce physical pain and relate to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some health experts have already made reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada Expert Report.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has referred to the attitude of the report-signing experts as "extreme", among other things, as these do not set any limits on euthanasia practice in the final phase of the disease.
“This opens the doors to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age asks another person to help him with his suicide,” said RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report seemed to place individual responsibility over all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
But now, he says, there would be “guidelines and obligations in a society.”
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed “strong opposition” to the report’s conclusions, which she called a “pro-euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, who herself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly doubts the report on the non-existence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign from power
Damascus denounces a “complot”
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, who, thanks to Russia’s support, opposes it and rejects a “complot” directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League’s exclusion of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbors, taking a position in favor of resigning President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan yesterday was the incumbent Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "put down his office in Syria" in which forty civilians and members of the government were already killed.
“If Bashar’s country’s interest were to be taken to heart, he would resign, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life,” the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been successful.
“Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must leave,” he said, citing Syria, the neighboring country, to which Turkey is taking a steadily roughening stance.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the “strengthening of the consensus against Assad as well as the machinations of the Syrian regime” as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries such as Turkey have set an increasingly sharp tone in the face of the repressions in Syria,” said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of government in the Dar'a region in southern Syria were killed, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) announced.
According to this NGO, two more civilians had been killed in “shooting and heavy bombing around Jobar” in the besieged city of Homs.
On the occasion of a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim nevertheless felt that the country was "directing towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has responded strongly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its tasks, which he considers to be a “dangerous step”.
Syria “will not yield,” he added, under cover of “the plots forged against Syria would fail.”
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a “protection mechanism for civilians” and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime that encapsulated him in his "Paranoia".
An extraordinarily planned new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan for the crisis crisis, which was decided on 2 November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military forces from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described the decision of the Arab League yesterday as “incorrect” in order to avoid advocating possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to be self-sacrificing
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that “victims” demand to regain the credit worthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties before today’s meeting of trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in parliament, which is relatively strictly composed of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the President-in-Office of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, for his part, had vowed to wait for Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to make sure that the new government has sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation of a deletion list presented by Mr Monti, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented that yesterday’s nervousness of the stock market and bond markets demanded their time.
In “a democracy, there are certain deadlines” to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, noting that it is “certain that markets will show up properly and consistently.”
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the turmoil had intensified again, especially after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should only exist until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the Parliament's proof of confidence by Friday.
Since taking up his role, Mr Monti has committed himself to working urgently in the sense of making Italy the "renewed protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis to the Italian economy itself does not change, taking into account the new government".
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of budgetary compensation in 2013, despite the austerity plans that have been adopted in recent months, has in particular requested new hardening measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, Italy's chief executive, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic stimulation "because a country that has no growth whatsoever cannot respect the deficit figures".
M. Monti, known for his competence and independence as an EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an “epochal change” of Italy after 17 years of “Berlusconism”; the “professor” symbolizes the “challenge of trustworthiness” as well as a “other Italy,” according to the lead article authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy now has to pay for 200 billion euros of government bonds by April 2012.
Russian Scientist Helps Iran's Nuclear Program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a nuclear-powered explosive capsule, a U.S. NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report by the International Atomic Security Agency AIEA and other documents issued by this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA announced its “serious concern” on the occasion of a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program last week.
According to an in-depth study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, apparently worked at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) for more than three decades since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was said to have left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA cited "strong evidence that Iran's development of a nuclear explosives system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only extremely skilled in this technique, but also, as a member of the agency's state announced, his entire professional career via essential work on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes have either decreased slightly or only increased slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics published on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% global increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes has been recorded.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 in a very weak measure, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% due to religious differences.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," Human Rights First said in a statement.
“Human Rights First had long stressed that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be seen as a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a member of the organization.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to combat these assaults,” he added, estimating that this could be done while improving police stance on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" presents itself in American federal law as an heir from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or descent, and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is transforming the platform and is becoming more and more similar to Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging website Twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to watch the activities of those who follow their entries, which makes the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" allow you to better read the live tracking of the activities of other "Twitters", the Internet users whose messages ("Tweets") are tracked and who track your messages.
This allows them to find out if they allow them to track their messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general internet distribution on Monday "in August at a small percentage of users", said Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner before the French news agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, stocked with some esothermic-looking wording (RT on the referenced repetition of another person's post). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec grand un maniement plus comparable cel+
On the network, users debated this innovation using certain "tweets" over the Internet.
“That’s useless, intrusive, and it’s too much like Facebook,” Jemb123 wrote.
"The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux tweeter," said Dannykronstrom.
Austria
Entry of a “Golden Budget Rule” into the Constitution
The government of the large social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include a “Golden Budget Rule” in the Constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria’s top credit rating system (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had proclaimed this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that Austrian public debt is 74.6%, far above the criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, but far below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency hadn’t dropped from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest each year,” Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellor and Christian-democratic foreign minister, said in a statement.
Austria is also responding to a demand from the Brussels Eurozone Member States Summit on 26 October: the heads of state and government at that time demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to public account balance in the constitution or by passing an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to include such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and as of 2017, the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas regional states as well as municipalities should have balanced households.
The aim is to eradicate budgetary debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement in the 2020/21 horizon.
Stronger Yen
Noda threatens a new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
“If we detect excessive volatility in the yen’s exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did last time,” Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was again up close to the historical levels that the Japanese authorities had forced to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen for dollars to lower the Japanese currency value, which is in the process of driving a new record value against the dollar since 1945.
However, the yen has risen regularly, baptised by purchases by investors who see the yen as a “refugee” in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This straw fire of the Japanese currency harms the archipelago's exports as it costs the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad as they exchange them in local currency.
“Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the 11 March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region,” stresses M. Noda, who fears that this Yen’s cost may already kill the weak recovery in the bud.
The third world economic power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - has again gained traction for the first time this year thanks to the sudden increase in exports and the consumption of the households "plowed" by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that the yen’s price does not reflect “Japan’s economic foundations.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to diminish the yen.
Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, however, has informed that the BoJ has already initiated "appropriate measures", stating that no additional currency easing is to be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the Federal Reserve had increased its sovereign bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to repay the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rate feet up fast, stock exchanges make withdrawals
The contagion risk of the debt crisis is constantly undermining the European key figures.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
The exchanges, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting a little further into negative areas this Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m. and fell to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt decreased by 0.4%, while London decreased by 0.1%.
“Due to the new tensions regarding the returns on government bonds in the eurozone in difficulty, global equity markets continue to issue some of their recent profits.
“The investors are nervous and are too well aware of the risk of infection,” said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn suffers from the renewed fear of the market participants about the capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a 0.7% penalty.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its eyes to Europe, and trading is moving on a limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the future of the eurozone is damaging the single currency, which continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1,3570 dollars, so it gave up 0.4%.
According to stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, which met in Congress on Monday, approved a motion that specifically provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to exit the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
The loan interest rates of Italy and Spain remain at a very disturbing level.
This Tuesday morning, the return on Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, while that on Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, as well as in France, continue to feed investors’ fears.
The future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti demanded more time from the markets to restore the situation threatened by the debt burden in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, for his part, had confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken on the occasion of the Eurozone summit on 27 October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the Visir of the markets, as the parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Expecting Eurozone Growth
Statistically, France recorded a 0.4% economic growth driven by household consumption in the third quarter, a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the figures for the second quarter with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, experienced growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first eurozone projection is expected at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should win over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, and a huge proportion of the world’s population should not have to give up a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to mitigate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to fight against climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision to the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only last-generation nuclear power plants.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, has decided to join another unit in its park by restarting the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Although the German model focused on renewable energy sources is occasionally set as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an increased dependence on energy, especially from Russia, due to the increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions from gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will be noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark, on the one hand, is the European leader in wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, used alternately with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
Since the energy price in the globalised economy is a key part of competitiveness and a stable asset for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore result in a sharp increase in energy prices, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Surveys found that it was a price that the vast majority of French people are just as unwilling to pay as it shows resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country’s energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125.00 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them the creators of countless jobs.
If France decides to quit nuclear power, most of these SMEs would be affected and the annual €6 billion of capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would hire an EPR designed to work for sixty years, if the decline of its producer is pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, one must admit that there is no miracle like a devil’s work for the production of electricity.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of the energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security agency that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks in existing plants, such as the Flamanville construction site.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just obsessed with the idea of security.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, in Three Mile Island, has entered under normal operating conditions; so it went without consequences for humans and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction and inexcusable human failure.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident caused by two unprecedented natural disasters caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident, just as it had done after the two preceding ones.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation of the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR presents a draft which enables it to be resilient to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF by letting them take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is indispensable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party manoeuvres dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy led by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from many angles - overloading of police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "land of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the authorities had shaped the press reports, the Interior Minister had casually announced (see Libération of 23 May) that France "does not need any talents, masons or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this issue between the right and the left.
On the right was the tone of Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left by Michel Rocard, who had stated in 1990 that France "could not take up all the poverty in the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
The fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
The immigrants were perceived by both camps as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity one is willing to admit to immigrants.
In his programme, Francois Hollande confines himself to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections; however, it is economically costly.
As economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us of in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of immigrants’ jobs and on the growth of their economies.
Restricting immigration would dampen growth and harm the labour market situation.
Fears of migrant influence are based on the notion that they threaten to replace the local workforce, especially the less skilled, by exerting pressure on their wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than domestic wage workers, as they focus on professions in sectors that are untapped in terms of workplace technology.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that attract local wage workers little, the more qualified among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not aligned with the job offer.
Positive pay effect
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity also has a positive effect on wages and domestic labour market conditions between locals and migrants.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants will result in a co-involved, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of ideas brought in by immigrants is beneficial, as well as economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the European countries on average at about 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that an immigrant to Germany at the age of 30 will contribute on average a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" at the start of his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; it is also a sensitive asset.
The European continent should be able to remember who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, had let the whole of the 20th century pass over the tragedies of World War I, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the chief in Greece.
Some had believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote in the most direct way possible to see democracy triumph over its enemies once and for all.
It has been known since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a characteristic of the mental attitude.
The universal suffrage, which constitutes the necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can become an instrument of "oppression" as well as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot said at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of powers, an education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of attitude of the Greek True-False referendum would have had a double enlightening character in this respect: once that of the need for a powerful return of politics, on the other hand also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted today, and that Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from pushing for a success of the national referendum, which was organized in the wrong order and depending on the necessities.
A free ticket for the European sole ruler or a jump with blind eyes into the emptiness of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackeble, but a collective task, fully justified and steadily, an election and democracy, this time on a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we don't even know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows to the dictate of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at the international level.
One is concerned about transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations affiliated to it.
The urgency is to give back the leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is important to the whole group whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, clear themselves of the markets and start a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis is a condition for decisions at European level, which cannot be taken without total democratic right, without leading us safely to destruction.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists has been fought for a long time, today everyone is pushing European economic governance to do so.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it envisages to the citizens - would be another foolishness and another impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order for the republic to arise in France, it was necessary to “create” Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not be sufficient here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become common good
The world trade fair for chip cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that allows payments in public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment, after a long time behind the Asia-Pacific region.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were distributed.
Consumer markets are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCards this year.
In order to move faster, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
“Two large French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing out bank cards equipped with contactless chips to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
So far, a small percentage of devices have been equipped with the NFC technology (Near Field Communication) required to carry out these transactions.
“You are in default.”
“But they should see a real upward trend at least next year.”
“We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also announced yesterday that it would prepare for the market launch of an offer that would allow its customers to make contactless payments by mobile phone.
Terrorist Front, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspicious relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers had now gained "certainty".
"The manner in which both organizations proceed and the relations of the intelligence services indicate a clear cooperation," he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has fostered interfaces to date.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators have said they have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the debris at the site.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of the phone calls leads to several interlocutors who are stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had been in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, for a long time; the other leads to a man who is considered close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we have to wait for clearer evidence before we can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
“It is conceivable, however.”
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from the outside world and that it is becoming increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "support services" have become more and more apparent, as have the speeches and the operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the attracting of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives that bear the same signature as those used by Aqmi.
Since then, the international community has put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed long regarded the group as a community of Illuminati, to which no special attention needs to be paid.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram – which in Haoussa means “Western education is a disgrace” – pursues the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and claims strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists are fighting against the ungodly central government.
The activists initially target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active in their intensified attacks against the commissioners.
However, the reaction from Abuja is, as usual, indifferent.
The army encircles the city, counting 800 dead.
The captive Mohammed Yusuf is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination attempt in Jos, which claimed 80 lives, then another one in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that took place at the secured police headquarters in Abuja, the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has since disturbed all security experts.
While the Aqmi occupied Mali and Niger, the Somalis of al-Shabaab operate in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat at the center of the continent.
Last week, during a talk with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned about Boko Harem and was ready to “communicate all the clues.”
The World According to Republican Presidential Candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are competing in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq, and aid to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidate this way, the voters could almost get that impression.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their collaborators have repeatedly made their thunderous statements, as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, a traditional republican focus.
Over China, Iran, and Israel’s aid – often in no way underpinned – slogans fall.
With regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", Mitt Romney threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and to accuse them of the "currency manipulation" -- a leading issue in an America that is initially irritated by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
It was stupid if that meant starting a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost snagged his breath in terms of his emotionally flattering gesture.
He had called for a solid but constructive dialogue with Beijing (also Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman is not heard, as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney also vowed military strikes against Iran should sanctions fail to stop the nuclear program.
“If elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb.”
He also promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of commitments to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest-ranking candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of the file.
Recently, he called for China’s military threat to be countered by Beijing’s “trying to develop a nuclear power” – and seemed to pay attention to the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, is, for his part, ready to take the American army into service in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama’s 2009 recourse to torture against alleged terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
One is far from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an external political heavyweight.
Contrary to current presidential opponents, Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War in spite of all this.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and had to pour water into his wine, as far as anti-terrorism was concerned.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
This hostility, however, is not quite so casual.
People are more likely to appreciate the positive balance of national security under Obama, which Bin Laden has turned off.
Since Iraq, it has guarded against military interventions that lead to silence.
And Obama is more appropriately surprised by arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership position.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendour and Gloria.
More than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new gas pipeline Nord Stream, which connects Russia and Germany directly under sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast last Tuesday under orchestral sounding and at gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon and his colleague Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly turned the control of the valve, which transports the Russian gas to the Western European network.
The new gas pipeline is expected to deliver 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km that connects the Saint Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas – the equivalent of France’s total consumption – is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line sound on the same track.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this enormous structure seems like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will allow for direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any trajectory by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a bit of their power: it is now becoming more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close off access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, did not shy away from comparing the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Soviet pact" in connection with the Hitler-Stalin alliance for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply through the support of this Russian project.
However, this is at the expense of a demolition of European energy, as the project has struck a break between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In barely five years, Russia has succeeded in enforcing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which have strong gas consumption and their gas reserves are depleted.
“This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way,” Fillon said at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the large gas contracts are important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete casing, which is to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m depth.
During their construction, minefields dating from World War II had to be avoided.
“Approximately hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The line is a long queue made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which is interrupted over the entire length by nothing: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers have refrained from it, as the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state company settle at the level of their coasts in a permanent manner.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller said.
In the event of a leak, the gas located in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be less likely, as the seams were estimated to have a perpetuity of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes by a sea ship, and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with a diameter of one meter, is inserted into the interior of the pipeline and moved through the gas pressure.
After three full days of moving through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information on its arrival about any deformations of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the entry point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gas Union and the French group of companies GDF Suez (each 9%).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, on a 20-year contract that could be extended.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the amount of gas that is actually transported," Jens Müller said.
The financing of gas pipeline construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are willing to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline is found on a sandy, pine-forested coastal stretch near Lubmin from the Baltic Sea.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other parameters of the incoming gas before it is passed on to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give new style to writing.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent at candlelight with writing.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the egg-shell-colored sides, as aged over time.
The Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a distinctive design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then specialist consultant of the company, is tasked with the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin, which designates a cotton back used, for example, for upholstered benches.
This type of notebook was very popular among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object, which was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success comes in.
Sales increased by 26% between 2006 and 2010, with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is far from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to create a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook delights businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs more than 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookstores, on internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in the city centers and is committed to enforcing its identity.
“We have followed the spirit of the times and its new writing needs, which persists despite the upswing of the emails,” said Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exhibition called "Detour (detour)", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard pattern cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural spirit of the times and understood how to diversify his products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer cases... The brand has the full range of articles.
In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
Approximately 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today begins the 15th Week of Work for the Disabled.
Despite a deliberate publicity policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice as high as the average: 19% against 9% of the total population.
Discouraging?
"No," said Eric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Association, which organizes the "week of work for the disabled."
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
At the time, the unemployment rate was not double, but triple as high.
"However, there is still a lot to do."
However, it must be said that many obstacles remain for the disabled before they get a job.
It affects older people more often: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled students among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared to 38% on average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to get back to work and that "form the core of the problem," says Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the real brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the mental attitudes, which are certainly developing, but are slowly evolving.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprentre association for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed have “a weak level of knowledge about disabled people” that “overrepresented” is “of persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually disabled.”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was stipulated in a 1987 law.
These latter figures from 2008 point to a quotient of 2.6%.
“We are now around 3%,” reports Pierre Blanc, Director General of Agefiph, the organization tasked with collecting contributions from companies that violate this law.
Proof: The number of "paying" establishments, as well as the sum of the amounts paid, has decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros) between 2007 and 2011.
“The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, created a strong pressure on companies,” Pierre Blanc said.
"But this improvement also shows a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of workplaces between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What a fortune"
Even before they faced the Blue Tuesday nights (20:45 a.m.), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens hadn’t hidden the pleasure that the friendly game brought them.
It would be too far to say that there was a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator stage of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could have made peace.
Five months after the temperamental gesture of his attacker against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had garnered nothing but praise for his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
“I want to look forward,” assures the native Lille.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in the club and the national team, "It's a unit that justifies everything."
“I’m in Lille all year round, which isn’t the case in Belgium.”
“It’s time for me to get started.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought Friday night against Romania in terms of the match against France, to finally "shine".
However, without neglecting the note of "pleasure".
He has been firing the French national team since the age of seven, and he led his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
“I have always been supported,” he said.
This inevitably contributes to further strengthening the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
“We just walked down the road.”
“Being able to play against them means great luck!”
Leekens, for his part, sounded “Pride.”
"The Pride of a Galamatch."
"Pride" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbors" - that France "has become a team at a very high level again", and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a very good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician will very well see himself sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
“We little Belgians come out big,” he stressed.
"We're about to plan something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll notice this in the upcoming games," including the match against France.
Portugal is very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward with great optimism to the return match against Bosnia this Tuesday in Lisbon (22:00 p.m.).
Both teams lacked the objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent to be reserved, namely Bosnia.
In view of the hinspiel (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not fallen yet.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put on the matter the important stamp that would have taken the pressure off it.
“This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn’t score a goal away.”
However, at home, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they can beat through the game in front of an audience that should be equally happy, even if the game was, of course, announced as "very scarce," said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
“We expect a very tight match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can win,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance to be at the 2012 European Championship,” Carlos Queiroz’s successor said.
The draw in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score and win a goal.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians who also need a goal.
“This is a good result, but it carries a certain risk as we haven’t scored a away goal,” Bento said.
“We will compete against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, in order "to give them no time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
