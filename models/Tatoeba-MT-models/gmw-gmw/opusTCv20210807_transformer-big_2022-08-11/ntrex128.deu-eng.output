Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
Some National Assembly members are shocked by the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
National Assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of ridicule.
A Labour Party member of the National Assembly said his group was concerned because the name rhymes with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.
For non-Wales readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "Aa".
A member of the National Assembly of the Plaid Cymru party said the entire group was “not happy” and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open about the name change, but pointed out the great similarity between “MWP” and “Muppet”.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law on name changes, said: “The final decision on names for the National Assembly members is, of course, up to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which gave broad support to the Welsh Parliament name for the National Assembly.
As regards the titles of the National Assembly members, the Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) or Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs) panel preferred, while the MWP option was most supported at a public hearing.
National Assembly members seem to suggest alternative options, but struggling for a consensus could pose a problem for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill within weeks.
The Reforms Act will include further changes to the functioning of the National Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of National Assembly members and on the design of the committee system.
National Assembly members may vote on their name in their debate on the law.
Macedonians Vote in a Referendum on a Change of Country Name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The referendum was set up to settle a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province similarly named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim is made to the Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its inclusion in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I was talking to said there has been a bar and a church on every corner in the past,” Adams said.
“Today there are no more.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social life is different today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly find themselves.”
In the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as church leaders assume, and that they “will be back at the beginning sooner or later.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums, where people do not support the remaining refuges.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be whites," he said, "and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were erected by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930s.
A black community holding their services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a large Harlem shopping street that refused to hire or support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's community members planned to rebuild it, they commissioned the bellplay.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly described the bell playing as "the bells of the poor."
The expert who sounded the bell in July used other words: “A cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors who have been drawn in part by the lay leaders of the church and in part by the bishopric.
In July, the municipal board of directors, which is made up of lay leaders, expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the municipal board of directors, although the latter had not been involved in commissioning the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some community members complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injured 13-year-old in California diving for Lobster
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the crib season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for cribs.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized the boy was screaming, “I’ve been bitten!
I have been bitten!”
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he found that his entire collarbone had been torn open.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but for the most part they are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Plans Advancement in the UK Cosmetics Market
Sainsbury's attacks with department stores-like cosmetics departments, staffed with specialized assistants, boots, superdrug and Debenhams.
As part of a large-scale push to the UK’s 2.8 billion pound cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household goods turnover declines, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested in eleven stores nationwide, and if successful, they will be expanded to additional stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods.
According to Sainsbury's, the volume of its cosmetics offering doubles for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also given more space and brand areas similar to those in stores such as boots.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its “boutique” makeup series, so that most of the products are vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test in two Sainsbury's outlets, the first one opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second one will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food on a daily basis in local grocery stores means that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since buying the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos stores and a number of Habitat outlets, increasing food sales and profitability of the acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drugstore stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281 branch pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for 125 million pounds three years ago.
The company stated that Lloyds will play a role in the plan in that it will add an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the enticing environment and favorable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that challenges the previous way of shopping."
Peter Jones “Angered” After Holly Willoughby’s Withdrawal from a  Pound 11 Million Business
“Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones is “furious” after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from a $11 million business with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the common homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop.
The “This Morning” presenter, 37, announced her withdrawal on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones through her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new connection contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “furious” when the “Golden Girl” of television admitted at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, to not be able to devote enough time to the joint homewear and accessory brand Truly due to their new businesses – worth up to .
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand Goop and was likely to have doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her withdrawal from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on his way to one of his vacation rentals.
A source said: “Truly was by far the highest priority for Holly.
It should secure their future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Her decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the market launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” moderator, one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in launching.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holidays together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We’re not commenting on his business matters.”
“Hard words, and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive comments about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, denuclearization negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told leaders from around the world on Saturday at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. clung to sanctions that were supposed to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: end of missile tests, support in the release of hostages and repatriation of the remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquakes devastate an island in Indonesia and cost hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although over 10 percent of the population of Lombok was displaced, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not requesting international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work locally.
Sutopo, spokesman for the Civil Protection Agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international bodies should participate in the relief measures.
In view of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent absence of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, despite a warning that has come into effect, has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is a challenge at the best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster at the earliest in three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of the malfunctioning Indonesian infrastructure the core of his election campaign, spending ample money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is striving for re-election next year, suffers from financing deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure due to ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their homes when gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a deep goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge with a hit in the 89th minute before a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a 0:1 backlog of his team at about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal.
He pointed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high over the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"I was just trying to get myself into this position and get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as much forward as possible, so I was just trying to make as much time as possible for myself," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the mid-time after a hit in the 25th minute with 1-0.
The blues striker gave a pass with his heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a fast double pass in midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass so that Hazard got into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and closed the net with a left shot of Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play at the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face in the UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Number of victims of tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, the Civil Protection Agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the ruins of buildings that had been brought down by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which had triggered waves up to six meters high, the government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed
After finding a female corpse this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was initiated.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 am with sting wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early stage, but I ask everyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a dash cam, to contact us, and they may have information that is of the utmost importance to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and the police said they are about to inform the victim’s nearest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to enter the building again.
It was heard, as a police officer told a man, that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
She keeps repeating, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police vehicles inside the barrier and another vehicle in front of the barrier.
Within the block were several police officers who monitored the apartment block.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to Protocol entry 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue in front of Parliament will be the latest memorial object of the dispute over the rewriting of history
Their exile would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick’s proposal as “foolishness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue became the target outside the Palace of Westminster.
The picture storm in the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the false Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a character that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century more than today, as someone who defended parliament against external pressure, in his case of course, through the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate account is the subject of ongoing debates on history.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure that represents one side of this chasm.
His achievements as a Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwestern China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, for whom only the surname “Yuan” was named, was found dead with a severed artery overflowing near a pigshed at the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, a pig farmer is getting ready to inject pig vaccines.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig stable was open.
He said there was a big male pig with blood on his snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had bitten the farmers dead.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” was quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera showed how Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been imprisoned to prevent attacks on other people while police gathered evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although it is rare for pigs to attack people, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 290 kilograms clamped a Welsh farmer between himself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife could scare away the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
They like to tweak and are very curious ... they are not out to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rain in the southwestern United States
As forecast, hurricane Rosa weakens on its way across the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding-causing rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 o’clock east coast time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean that moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will trigger up to 25 centimetres of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity in the coming days generates widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest due to interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous flooding, water-driving debris, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity results in precipitation rates of almost 5 to 7.5 centimetres per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, precipitation is expected to be up to 5 to 10 centimeters.
Due to the scattering of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In view of the impending tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into tearing streams, and thunderstorms bring local wind gusts as well as wind that carries dust with it.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitation quantities of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris floating in the water and to smooth roadways.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers arrive in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four Corners region and continues on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12oC.
Over the next few days, the sustained summer heat is trying to develop and expand again.
For a large part of the middle and east of the U.S., a warm beginning of October is expected with widespread temperatures around 27oC from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the east of the United States.
More than 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers on Thursday on six television networks saw the captivating statements of Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued, and on Friday the television stations interrupted their regular program because of a last-minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Arizona senator, that the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, pressured her and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company calculated the average audience at CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this in perspective: This corresponds roughly to the audience numbers at a play-off football match or at the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks, according to Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million spectators at the full-day hearing.
ABC came second with 3.26 million spectators.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office released a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed Friday morning by cameras from CNN and CBS as protesters drove him in the elevator on his way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood for minutes with a lowered look while being scolded, and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the country?”
“You have power while so many women are powerless,” said one woman.
Flake said his office had published a statement and added, before the elevator closed, that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcast networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on the forwarding of Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI, as requested by the democratic minority, investigate the allegations against the candidate next week.
Flake is partly convinced by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was of great importance as it was obvious that without the investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has prompted an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, to use Britain’s future for political purposes and undermine the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will meet in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was published on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson exacerbated his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit by describing a proposal that envisages the reciprocal collection of tariffs by the UK and the EU as “completely absurd.”
Deadly shots on Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shootings on Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained by Baton Rouge police for manslaughter.
The agency released video recordings of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
As CBS partner station WAFB reports, police secured the glasses at the crime scene and said that Simpson’s DNA was found on the glasses.
After a questioning of Simpsons, police said he confessed to the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer said the bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner’s Office released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound on the throat.
Police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the federal police’s criminal engineering laboratory, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement agency for “their care and their pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season he scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “deeply shaken” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“You’re always scared of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ashes on Mexico City.
Ashes ejected from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of grudges and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity on the volcano, 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since an earthquake of 7.1 magnitude struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following clashes between the riot police and pro-independence protesters, and thousands attended other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, withheld by the riot police, threw eggs on them and also thrown colored powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that were usually populated with tourists.
During the rest of the day, there was also a deal with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups scandalized “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness,” while unionists shouted “Long live Spain.”
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries during the protests.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid saw as illegal but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters had overwhelmingly opted for independence, despite low turnout, as the opposing parties boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes outside the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups camped outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, said he sees the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence no longer with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in last December’s regional elections, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulty maintaining the momentum this year. Many of their most famous leaders are either in self-imposed exile or imprisoned, waiting for their trials because of their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament election next year.
“To run as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the reduction of democratic values and the suppression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Rammed Home
Three men aged 33, 34, and 39 were arrested after a Londonderry home had been rammed by a car several times.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, a crossbow may have been shot at the car.
Menga hit means 1-0 victory over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The ascended Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga’s score proved crucial for Gary Holt’s team to be able to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard’s team will remain in the Premiership this season without a away win and will face the hearts the next Sunday, which are eight points behind.
The Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingston will be able to increase its division win streak to six games, meaning chief coach Holt has not yet experienced a loss since his acquisition of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against open-minded guests
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness posed the Rangers with a wide variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal, and Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate was reached.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance where Declan Gallagher and Robinson put menga in the shot position, which shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball, but could not overcome the defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unhurt.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend himself.
Scott Pittman was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor with his feet, and Lithgow sniffed the ball past from another standard Livingston situation.
Flanks repeatedly entered Livingston’s penal area and were regularly removed from the danger area, while two required punitive blows – one from Halkett against the exchanged Glenn Middleton and one for hand play – were denied.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They have always been excellent and have exceeded expectations in this upward trend.
Her playing style and her team have barely changed since she returned to the top teams, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way he has woken the team up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept on their toes throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they couldn’t reach that standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the team of the hosts – and that’s kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was to serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then travelled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many adherents found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, which is praised by some German Turks as a hero and reproached by others as autocrats.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
In a collision with a car, a cyclist died in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics took care of the man, but he died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials worked to identify the man and notify his closest relatives.
Roadblocks and diversions for buses have been set up, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots in a high-security prison for men.
The riots erupted on Sunday at about 9:30am British summer time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and still stop.
Specialized “tornado” officials have been called in to end the riots involving eight occupants limited to one wing.
Officials were treated locally for minor injuries on the face.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We don’t tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that those in charge will be handed over to the police and may spend longer time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 detainees, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was treated in the hospital after an attack by a prisoner.
In October last year, police officers were summoned to the prison to take action against serious riots in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with Floods (Drought Areas May Benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s probably going to happen early next week, when the remnants of hurricane pink pull over the desert-ridden southwest, bringing with it the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday from the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, as well as to the southeast of California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation with occasional up to 15 centimetres in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the deserted southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are probable and occasionally up to 10 centimetres are possible.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is of great concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as there is currently a drought in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, at least extreme drought occurs in just over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest category.
First of all, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, followed by the hurricane moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and weaken as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to land in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the strength of a tropical storm.
Precipitation can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall is expected to be between 7.5 and 15 centimetres, with up to 25 centimetres possible,” weather.com reported.
Subsequently, Rosa will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up through Arizona to the south of Utah by late Tuesday evening.
“As a major danger, Rosa or her remains are expected to have very strong rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-ridden southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said.
As a result of this rainfall, life-threatening floods and water-driving debris as well as landslides are expected in mountainous areas in the desert.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
After finding a 16-year-old with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at 4:00 p.m. British summer time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital, and his condition is "stable".
According to the police of Avon and Somerset, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
The officials asked everyone who had records of what happened on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “the meanness, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and outrageous tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered "under the meanness, the anger" of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said Thursday before Congress, rejecting the accusation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusation.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in service to the general public,” he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he talked about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not coming in, but in reality I’m coming in,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, death tolls increase
According to the authorities, at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, many of whom were swamped away as a result of a strong earthquake and a tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi hit the beaches with gigantic waves.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a feast on the beach of the city of Palu, when at nightfall up to six meters high waves hit the beach, killing many people and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t run away immediately, and they fell victim to it,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian civil protection agency BNPB at a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it floated cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had moved across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people have climbed trees while fleeing the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the Civil Protection Agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive quake corresponded to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have grown larger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “comprehensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damages could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugrohos, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency was criticized many times for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official data.
Amateur footage published on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building who desperately warns people on the street under him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the shore and floats buildings and cars away.
Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the recordings immediately.
The quake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that interrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to the authorities, the military has begun to send freight planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city’s airport will remain closed until October and will only be reopened for relief.
A visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has increased to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
The employees of World Vision from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tent shelters in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Doseba, they passed scenes of devastation along the way.
“They said they had seen many destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even as the aid groups began the hard task of launching disaster relief, some complained that skilled foreign aid workers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible when the place of an accident has been declared a national disaster zone.
This has not happened so far.
“At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘Okay, this is a national disaster’, we can accept international support, but this status is not valid until now.”
While the second night since the earthquake and tsunami on Friday lowered over Palu, friends and family members of the still missing hoped for one of the miracles that lighten up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was pulled out of a sewage canal.
On Sunday, rescuers liberated a woman who had been trapped in rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were prisoners at the Roa Roa hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior paraglider, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the Roa-Roa hotel collapsed among paragliders, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who participated in the beach party.
His messages, however, instead of blue check marks, only led to gray question marks.
“I think that means the news wasn’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Padding an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a Newport police press release, Friday morning in Newport on the Levee thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee while filling up an ATM.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to put in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came running behind the employee of Brink’s” and stole a bag full of money destined for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but the police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday’s announcement of the change on Twitter, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears in the show as a substitute for singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled, according to the producer, for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious meaning for the West.
“I believe ‘ye’ is the word most commonly used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said in a conversation this year about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am we, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, only ‘yes’ became – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album more reflects what we are."
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West has previously worked, has already written his name with and without hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population while the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students in his country is approaching.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at the Tlatelolco Plaza, “never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people, and at that time left-wing student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans through monthly student support and the opening of additional free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities inflicted youth on criminal gangs.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow on from AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: The country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start given that all other countries are so far behind the US, we’re looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling financial resources could double the chances that the next big AI success would be achieved in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the top-ranked American Othello player, later serving as a senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee honored former U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that takes the top academics away, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired coryphs of universities to work on AI.
According to Lee, a change in U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that in the field of AI, people with a PhD should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council unveiled its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China finances people at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have been unchanged for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on a change of country name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this entitlement to the Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed the admission of Macedonia to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign casts doubt that the turnout reaches the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, admission to organizations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said they would stick to the result so that it is crucial.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had cast their vote.
“I’m here to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in a referendum on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia on the change of country name that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not through the back entrance,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
In his words, a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them said they would vote “yes.”
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvers through the entire Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton in Manchester's 2-0 victory at Etihad Stadium on Saturday.
Aguero made his hit look ridiculously simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He raced between three Brighton defensive players and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several more defenders on the edge of Brighton's penal area.
He then shot a pass to the left to Sterling.
The English attacker used his first ball contact in the penalty room to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
That goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on this move far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few moves to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before it slipped out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Joker wants to spoil the game for the Rockies
Since the nationals have left the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the ever-powerful joker hopes to be on the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if this is relevant to the playoffs for the Rockies who have a lead ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard on Friday night with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level I’d encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to have jokers thrown in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced bullpen on Thursday and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington-Rechtshund has a statistic of 18-7 this season, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation in connection with the Brett Kavanaugh he selected for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not kicking in, but in reality I’m kicking in, that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by all means, you see the meanness, the abomination.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give them.”
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
“And you see that in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “angerous and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He named the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judicial Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which triggered loud shouts from the audience.
“Do you remember their answer?
Did you leave the document out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for you -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour no longer accepts all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as no surprise.
After all, I’m the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told they’re not welcome – just because we’re saying our opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had been vigorously opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for having a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians.
The announcement of the meeting of Nottingham East Labour on Friday said, “The meetings should all be involved and productive.”
Most of the time, the Friday evening GC meetings in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Today, unfortunately, most meetings are not marked by this tone, and the promised 'kinder, more cautious' policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun at all.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that every opinion is judged by whether it is accepted by the Party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I shared similar political views expected me to turn around and take positions that I would never have agreed to otherwise, be it national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – no matter what I say – a social media riot follows, calling for my election, denouncing the political center and saying that I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
With this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, as the comments addressed to me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis and yet never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every motion of no confidence and every change in the rules of the election, the party becomes more narrow-minded.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to pull my head in and not express my opinion so clearly, that I would “have no problems”.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, as a result of which my classroom literally fell apart in the whole school, I have fought for better public services for those most in need – as a municipal council and as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a secret of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way about my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s motion, I just want to say the following: given that the country is rushing towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, I do not send this one message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many electoral threats or political reasoning will not stop me from acting in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the final result a bit, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this extremely entertaining game of the day at the Tennent’s Premiership.
You are now the only one of the ten teams to stand unbeaten at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the success of the home team was due to their superior defenses as well as their better exploitation of opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Recognition for Ayr, they’ve used their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was raised by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr in the lead. However, due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot made an unincreased attempt.
Climo expanded the lead of Ayr with a penalty kick before hitting directly at halftime and then hitting an increased try on his own, so it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
Melrose, however, started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was raised by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
After a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, which was carried from the field, Ayr expanded his lead by a more climotic attempt by Stafford McDowall.
Then Blair Macpherson, acting as Captain of Ayr, received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a period of enormous pressure, Melrose let the additional man pay by an unincreased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty lane behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo increased as it did almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxing kick and sent flank player Gregor Henry to the home team's fifth attempt.
“Still Game” star seems ready for a new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran seems ready for a change to the hospitality industry after it turned out that he was named as managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is managing director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was interested in getting into Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business."
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia enclosed by land hopes a court will open its way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz.
There is a sea-blue flag on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
To win it back is a duty.”
Everywhere in Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a judgement of the International Court of Justice to be given on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects the outcome with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s ruling on large screens in the hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim, according to which, after decades of sporadic talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial battle for his re-election next year, there is also much at stake in the verdict on Monday.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to assign Chilean territory and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law, the IGH’s ruling is already six months after the final plea.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also be a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has raised the question of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
It hinted that Morales’ military rhetoric had suffocated any remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision had fallen unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139 years of disputes for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the subject of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to realize that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament only happens if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to put into action the promises made during a summit between the rival leaders in Singapore.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, appears to be on the verge of restarting the stuck nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the notion that further sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees as a “brainfright.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree with the statement without Pyongyang taking substantial disarmament steps first.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal where the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris showcase the latest collections of giant headgear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed a palette of crazy oversized headgear on the catwalk for their 2019 summer collection, which fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the catwalk.
The most outstanding piece by Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that almost crushed the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include jeweled watermelons, a sorcerer’s hat and even pineapple, but these are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were sewn on lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than Haute Couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted egg bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you’re lucky.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge headgear could find its way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly on “La Bomba”, the straw hat with 60 centimeters wide edge, which all wear from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another great creation across the catwalk: a straw beach bag almost the size of the swimsuit-wearing model that held the bag.
The reddish orange bast bag with a white leather handle was the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera" at the Paris Fashion Week.
Prominent stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, “I expect large hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has raised so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding examination results and is only backed up by individual and joint achievements in the fields of sports, art, music and other collaborative ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t rely only on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current results of this year’s exam show that languages with the highest pass rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned foreign languages scored A at the higher exams.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored grade A at the higher exams, while 72 percent of students learning German, 69 percent of students learning French, and 63 percent of students learning Spanish also scored grade A.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as an important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as electives as well as STEM subjects (natural sciences, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for occupying vacancies were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly imperative when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more vacancies require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an edge over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language of a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today’s children that we invest in language lessons now.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught at all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, independent schools will always have a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may look like.
At this time in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of fundamental importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It is very fair.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is coming to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
How many minutes he will play is not yet known.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason game schedule after training.
“I don’t need any preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, including at his well-meaning locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the pending vote to confirm his vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming mid-term election in November as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place tonight, and how can you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia online as a live stream on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to address Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings on allegations of sexual misconduct conducted in a tense atmosphere this week, and the expected Senate vote on confirmation remains on hold for up to a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this rally series is to support Republicans facing difficult elections in November.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies next week serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could include followers from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and media from Pittsburgh.”
Saturday’s visit is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Combat Readiness to Maintain Hope for Singles on Sunday
After three one-sided laps, the four-part matches on Saturday afternoon may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a pure invention as a sporting concept, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this.
So where do you think the momentum is now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that means a little momentum for us,” Jordan Spieth said.
Europe is, of course, in an advantage, with four points ahead, while twelve others follow.
The Americans, however, feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and have three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from tee to green and leads by example.
The guttural enthusiasm screams grew louder over the course of his round as he sank an important put to decide the fourth four-point match for both of them after he and Thomas were back after two holes with two points.
His putt, which decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream that suggests that the American team is not out of the game yet.
“I really need to kneel down and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days, undoubtedly writing the story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can’t go wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only couple that didn’t beat a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the crowd underlines that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory at the sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-time hero of the morning, who played with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles at the front nine holes put the Spaniard and the Swedes in a clamp that they couldn’t get close to.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out.
The fours and fours are so fascinating to look at from up close due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or not give, and the way a strategy can change lightning fast.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this round of four has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, which some, especially in the US, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the fours and fours on Saturday, Europe is ahead of the USA with 10:6 and goes with a solid lead into the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The ingenious duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, earning four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Björn, who wants to win back the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the fours in the morning against the faulty American team and won the series with 3:1.
In the fours, the United States made more resistance and won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points in the twelve individual games played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational weekend of "Molliwood", were only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in their four opening matches.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized superbly and beat the disenchanted Woods and the American newbie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the fours in the morning, returned and played the fours as a partner of Henrik Stenson, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, everything did not go according to their ideas.
Three-time Major Winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 win in the fours over Spain-playing Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after it went into singles with a backlog of four points, but as a title holder, Furyk's team is enough to keep the trophy.
Since they have only been in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they can start a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea rejects unilateral disarmament without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their distrust of the United States and that under these circumstances the country would by no means unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly that last year, North Korea took “essential action in good will,” for example, it stopped nuclear and missile testing, dismantled the nuclear test site, and committed to not multiplying nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We don’t see any response from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the US, there is no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated trusted complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach, which rewarded North Korea for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in that it did not reject a one-sided denuclearization from the outset, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim had promised to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, while the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes calls for a loosening of severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘first denuclearization’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and is even opposed to the ‘explanation of the end of the war,’ Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to our knees is a fantasy of the people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our distrust.”
Ri did not comment on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party in the denuclearization issue instead of the US, it would not have come to a halt in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was vastly different from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. with North Korea’s missiles after “evil president” Trump described Kim as a “missile man” on suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who threatened North Korea’s “total destruction” last year, praised Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions needed to remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it’s two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council must reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “Enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must in any case continue vigorously until we have reached full, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea to financially dry out Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he said on his departure from Pyongyang that progress had been made only to be accused hours later by North Korea of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea pledged to dismantle a rocket base and a nuclear complex this month at a meeting with Moon if the United States took “adequate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the “according measures” sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn enough sleep in a course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year. This is a measure against the spreading macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to taking care of themselves.
Designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the course is the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to initiate the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end of the day, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s first course explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university chose to launch the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see the picture of a room in a dormitory and click on coffee mugs, curtains, training shoes and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
Afterwards, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine with interactive symbols using a map of the university grounds.
“We know it won’t change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a “night shift” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-growing pressure on students make the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Ensuring enough sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and weight gain could be avoided as sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode, causing them to be constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having taken one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before they begin their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler, students should face an alarm for bedtime and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emanating from electronic screens and LED lights, which can take the circadian rhythm off the beat. This leads to problems when falling asleep.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerrard's player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga’s goal for Steven Gerrard’s discordant team meant a 0-1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to make their first away victory since the 4:1 victory at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's first second defeat in 18 games as a manager, leaving his team eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership by far leading hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the inspiring Rangers didn’t seem to have a chance to balance up.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian at the goal difference.
The Rangers are also in danger of further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who lost a point to the Hearts last week and would have to be thrilled to see how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure every step of the way.
The Rangers dominated the ball, but Livingston achieved more if they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal in just two minutes when Menga's first hand led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot by the side.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot past the back post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than persuaded in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos apparently felt that he should have gotten a penalty after a quarter of an hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not apply the complaints of the Colombian.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a tame shot of Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s 34th minute hit may not have matched the game’s progression, there’s no denying that they deserved it for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers were unable to handle a ball shot by Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and chose menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded mid-time and swapped Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, the change almost instantly impacted when the wing player put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get guests to play exactly the game that suits them, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving one long ball at a time.
Holt’s team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood up well and fed Jacobs before Lithgow fired a headball from the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also called for a late penalty kick after a mix with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning"-Almanach: On 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger Counter, which has since become the standard element of science, also became a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “In fact, I hear a crack!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention, which bears its name, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” degraded cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerate cells.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize degenerate cells.
The method takes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory.
These cells can "see" a lot of cancers common protein and are then injected again.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancers.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect degenerate cells, disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method takes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory so that they can “see” the HER2 protein common to many cancers and then inject the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method of removing immune cells and teaching patients to attack cancer cells has helped treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tirade after his appearance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was buoyed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after he widely praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run as a presidential candidate in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, Ghost Town, wearing a Make-America-Great-Again cap, he went on with a cannonade against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by white people, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s racist.’
So if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judicial Committee about Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment.
Although the recording of West's schimptirade was not broadcast, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the stage because of his headgear.
“They bullied me behind the scene.
You said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
You've bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken area," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues: “Will you see the sunken area?” He said he would “put on my Supermancape because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want it to go ahead with the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered at least twice buzz calls from the audience, and SNL contributors seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine, “It was deadenstill in the studio.”
West had been lately hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture entitled "I Love It", in which he was disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, tweeting: “To one of the bravest ghosts: THANK YOU HAVE ENCOURAGED THE MESS.”
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just himself and that is absolutely wonderful.
“But I DO NOT want to reward someone who, in my opinion, adopts and gives in to an ideology harmful to my community (by buying his music or his clothes or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to “The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.”
Indictment of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was injured with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred, according to police in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear at the Belfast Court of Arbitration on Monday.
The allegations are reviewed by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword-swinging Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling that they have to be strong in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believes something went wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the Metoo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, who also participated in Game of Thrones, admitted that solving the problem was “very important to him.”
“I personally find the question very important at the moment, what went wrong with the masculinity,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men about the problem we’re seeing now?”
Harington believes that TV may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate, and what has been learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes boys feel like they have to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
There was something wrong with the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer he will not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones", he has "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington will be featured in a new edition of Sam Shepard's "True West," the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him, the best thing about Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so this is how I have kept my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the mistress of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced almost to zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Based on the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sexual intercourse with men end up marrying women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to inadequate protection during intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking GOP senators’ data, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied allegations on Saturday that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the MP’s Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles-based Democrat argued that the claims of “ultra-right” experts and websites would be spread.
“Lies, lies and even more heinous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information will include the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released during the hearing of a Senate committee on the allegations of sexual offenses against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh by an unknown person in the government district.
The release took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the leakage of that information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they have not done must not be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the accuser’s motives.
You have to be calm and calm.”
Butcher seemed to compare Waters’ reaction with Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who competes in the mid-term elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed and that they are held accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Review of “Johnny English – You Only Live Three Times” by Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new British-coloured film. This seems to also apply to the revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spy That Died” and revived stutteringly in 2011 with “Johnny English – Now Pretty” .
Will an ironic self-parody on the subject of how obvious we are become the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glossy, grim and incompetent Johnny English was extended for a second time, signaling more than anything else that he is a general comic creation for cinemagoers in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he’s again the dumb secret agent who bizarrely thinks he’s cool and worldly, while in reality he’s made up of some Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a crack of this guy who contributed a single note to the title tune of “The Hour of the Winner” at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos behind abandoned travelers and international secret agents, which Atkinson played in the now forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
Johnny English’s last adventure has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly covered his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is revealed, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the “serious” movie series such as “007” and “Mission Impossible” now offer self-confident comedic elements.
Humor seems to be more aimed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy mishaps aren’t as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in the role of Bean.
The current premise is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in use, much to the displeasure of the service agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, an inflated and oppressed figure already facing a complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been uncovered and therefore she must get someone out of retirement.
This includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a fancy facility, but unofficially gives lessons in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former heavily tested Kumpan Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who always go terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme Fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously captivated by a charismatic tech billionaire, the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their odyssey of grotesque fun: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, they cause chaos as they smuggle on board Volta's luxury yacht, and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house using a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already discussed in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English movies, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan for the British to work four days a week, but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that requires the British to work four days a week but to be paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to employees in the form of an additional day off.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea of the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country for the benefit of workers "fits".
The transition to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “Before the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced.
“A change will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an effort consistent with the Party’s approach to restoring economic equilibrium for the benefit of workers and with the Party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea, and the Green Party promised to launch a four-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this approach as a whole.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not party policy and it is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell concretized his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profit makers” at public utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not get their entire share back, as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to appoint employees to the boards of directors and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of the equity of private companies to the employees who collect annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy comment in 60 Minutes news magazine whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told the hearing that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be sculpted in stone.
"My opinion is clear about Brett Kavanaugh, and a bomb would have to burst," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she called couldn’t confirm it.”
It's 36 years now.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which will be held for the 7th time this year, to experience not only the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to fight extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which first took place in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international interest group that seeks to combat poverty by encouraging more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks, such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen still has 12 years to reach the goal?
Is the idea of having a cool free concert in prospect, a sensible way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think you can change something by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that since 2011, the project has recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieved various goals.
These actions are said to have helped inspire leaders around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised via fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have committed to supporting children in their optimal development, and who have promised to help Rwanda with $35 million to combat malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for the The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They answered, “It will be a long and strenuous way with ups and downs.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed as we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
U.S. Could Use Navy for Blockade Purposes to Obstacle Russian Energy Exports
According to Washington Examine, Washington can resort to the Navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets including the Middle East, said US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment in Syria is an excuse to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently operating in these areas at the invitation of the lawful government.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is negotiating new energy markets, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways to address this.
"The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea routes remain open and block them if necessary, in order to ensure that the energy from Russia does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the Consumer Energy Alliance event, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “voice of electricity consumers” in the United States.
He made a comparison between Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, while calling Russia a “one trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was in the process of expanding liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, the government officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trump, made Berlin the “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the US$11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has received backwind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren wants to “examine” a 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “examine” a presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine” a presidential candidacy after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is directing this country in the wrong direction.
“I’m extremely concerned about how Donald Trump deals with our democracy,” she said.
Warren hasn’t taken a leaf in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that before the vote, of course, an FBI investigation is required.
However, a poll published Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe poll, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 percent of the voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent advocating a potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin Speaks at Donald Trump’s Rally on Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder That Track Palin Suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and part of the wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told audiences at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest an “elephant in the room” and said about their son and other war veterans that they are coming back altered, that they are coming back more fraught, that they are coming back and wondering if there is that respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given the country.
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support an appeal for a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and the district filed a court statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker questioning policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the grace-against-session lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Grace referred to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international levels.”
“The federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” was stated in the court’s statement.
Further, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policy of denying immigrants access to the country has an unfavourable effect on the U.S. economy, as immigrants may be more likely to work as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asyl exists for anyone who leaves their home country because they are persecuted or fearful because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It was never the plan to defuse all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people struggle with every day worldwide.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, reassuring her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance arrives with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their soaked belongings while hiding everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the hospital staff, who were damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu’s military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was trapped under the invaded walls,” he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, but then there was calm.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they are in a safe place.”
US ambassador accuses China of tyranny with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused the state capital of Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
US Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the China Daily’s paid supplement to Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling magazine, after he accused China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, an indictment China denies.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing has been trying to interfere in the U.S. election are in line with the announcement by U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements for the promotion of the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in an expansive trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
The Chinese retaliation tariffs at the beginning of the trade war should meet exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa who exports agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad said in a statement on Sunday’s Des Moines Register, is now doubling this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“By disseminating its propaganda, the Chinese government claims America’s proven tradition of freedom of expression and independent press by turning paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing, you will only find a limited number of votes against and not a real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s most famous newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans spoil female voters with Kavanaugh debacle ahead of midterm elections, warn observers
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming midterm elections, which could start from women in particular.
The mood in this context was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they are continuing with a vote.
“Such things cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University The Hill’s Maxwell School, in a statement.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) last-minute move was sufficient for an FBI investigation to soothe angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow, and they don’t forget it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate hallway shouted “November is coming!” when Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to stick to Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer to the news page.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially among female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, observers suggested that a counter-reaction could result if Republicans advance confirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
“It’s not just about voting the panel, final voting, or reviewing Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way Republicans handled it and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats.
However, Americans seem to disagree on who to believe based on Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, with a slightly larger share on the latter’s side.
A new survey by YouGov showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or likely convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% said they definitely or likely believed Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38% said they believe Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied to in his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford made an affidavit to the Senate Judicial Committee last week that she was attacked by drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during their time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the intent behind Inrupt was “global domination.”
“We need to take action now,” he said on the topic of startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so that users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other private and corporate tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is in one browser and available at the same time.
The special thing about personal online data storage is that the user can decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development via data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company uses resources, processes, and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee announced that he and his team will not be sharing with Facebook and Google on whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely transform their entire business models overnight.
“We do not ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I am extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victoria Cross in World War I, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award for his efforts in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was symbolic, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, through dense fog and under heavy shelling of field guns and machine guns.
Later, he advanced to the line of fire and led the line forward with the “greatest courage” before running ahead with a field weapon on his own and shutting down three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s deeds were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that would make you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he laid a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he is very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero becomes visible, especially through the support of many people.
MMA fans have stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve stayed awake all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 battles, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock then, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, audiences in the UK were not badly amazed when Peppa Pig suddenly appeared.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early morning hours to specifically see the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to the animated character as a kind of bad joke.
“Due to government regulation, this content is classified as non-adult, so it had to be switched to a children’s show at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly.”
Bellator’s board of directors, Scott Coker, announced that the company will work on the schedule to accommodate UK viewers in the future.
“I think the problem could already be solved in the replay,” he said.
“But it’s 6am on a Sunday in the UK, and we won’t solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we'll stick to it.
There was a lot of communication during the change. It was pretty messed up and it wasn't always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed it was a technical failure.
What was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen like that again.
We’re going to reduce it to 5 fights instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we’ve tried to give fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite unfortunate.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' to Sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper in several Olympic games, says that he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to be so successful.
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at secondary school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since he became a father, the victories at the Olympics are no longer so important to him.
The long-term show host, Kirsty Young, is pausing for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne’s first show, he said that he used to consider himself inferior compared to others, since the love of boys and girls was completely socially unacceptable.
“To this day, feeling inferior and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he was a very special personality, not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medalist at the Olympics is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he spoke on the subject because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to encourage others.
The triple world champion fell in love with the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference has never been an issue.
He says that if you had to go through so much as a child and a teenager – he took part in the Olympics for the first time at 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley thinks his whole view has changed since then.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him, there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his biggest win.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the approaching death, and one of the last things he asked for were the tickets for London 2012 as he wanted to be at the forefront.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after that that that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympics.
“I only knew it was always my dream to dive in front of local audiences at the Olympics – that was the madness,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud of Heather Small – was also influenced by the song he heard in the run-up to the Olympics and still took care of goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is not currently in shape, sits on the replacement bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday at his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to make a lot of effort so that the whole thing doesn’t turn into a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the replacement bench for the Fourballs and Foursomes by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering on others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that burden him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal cast for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly punished.
And as if the pitch itself wasn’t daunting enough, Mickelson will meet perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth match, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer at these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans make a hot start with four points behind in the 12 singles games, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was perfectly aware of his role today, knocked me on the back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He is one of the world’s best-known personalities and he has done so much for these teams in the past and this week as well.
I didn’t think he was there for two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach the Nick Faldos record for most of the Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson scored 18 victories, had 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone had enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to make a few jokes, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit this week, and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Björn knows that the lead will soon be over.
The captain of the European team, Thomas Björn, knows from experience that a big lead leading to the final singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came just over the finish line and led with the smallest possible lead, achieving a victory of 141-2-131-2.
"The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that was scarce," said Björn (pictured in the photo) after seeing the win 5-3 of the Class of 2018 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
Experience shows me and all team members that it’s not over.
It's gonna be all right tomorrow.
Get in touch and do the right thing.
The whole thing is not over until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that’s where our focus is.
I’ve always said I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re totally aware of what’s on the other side of the game: the best players in the world.”
Rejoicing at the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never rush that.
Tomorrow will be another caliber.
Tomorrow the individual services are in the foreground and that is a completely different thing.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested to the limits of your skills as a golfer.
You have to make it clear to the players: get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players perform individually better than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turnarounds on the last day of the tournament. He stood on the winning side in Brookline before he stood on the side of the losers after Europe's "miracles of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We’ve got 12 important games tomorrow, but you’d like to pull off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medina.
When the momentum strikes in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We put our team up accordingly and send our guys out the way we feel, you know, we’re trying to magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of making a setback, he has to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as more Europeans in the top half of the leaderboard.
“I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said about his selection for the individual encounters.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have been put in service as early as 2014 in order to replace years-old warships from the Cold War period. However, according to local media, due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs, it will not be delivered until next year at the earliest.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that referred to a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service as early as 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which were already ordered by the Navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea target missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods. It should be possible that the latest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can lead to the state-of-the-art warships that are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power already being outdated at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The Fregatte F125, which was followed by the accident, got into the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned a ship to the shipyard after it was delivered.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware errors" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, since ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, resulting in performance losses and preventing the Navy from carrying out rearmament measures in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, became a problem.
Apparently, costs rose to a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the originally planned €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, Defence Officer of the German Bundestag, confirmed that the navy "goes out the operational ships".
Bartels said the problem grew over time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be removed from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
In an estate in the Scottish Highlands, new research is being carried out to show how bats use the landscape in food hunting.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track down dwarf and mosquito bats as well as the brown long ear and water bats at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key locations on the property to record the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations using portable detectors.
In the case of a noise analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of the bat calls is determined and determines which species does what.
A map and a report of the habitat is then created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as creating meadows, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Fledermaus stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affect sleeping places and lead to habitat loss.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey due to their nighttime hunting habits.
They use sophisticated ultrasound mapping to detect insects and obstacles in their trajectory.
The NTS, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland, takes the theme of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who carry out regular examinations, inspections of sleeping places, and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave property in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats yet, so we’re doing this work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of first excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and young animals and wipe out the entire population on site.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or destroy them or their nesting areas.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and for many of our species we don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called allegations of rape against him “fake news” and said people want to “be famous” by using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Supposedly, he then paid her $375,000 to buy her silence on the incident, according to Der Spiegel on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “fake news” hours after they were released.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News,” the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or said in the camera.
“They want to be distinguished by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror for allegations they called “inadmissible reporting on privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for “moral damage at a level equal to the severity of the violation, which is presumably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went into the player’s room, where he allegedly raped them anally, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” who succumbed to “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirms that the two had sex, but say it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of retribution" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to revoke the agreement, as she is still traumatized due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and switched to Italian giant Juve in a $100 million deal this summer.
Brexit: The UK would 'forever regret' the loss of car manufacturers
The UK would “eternally regret” losing its status as a world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily interrupt production at the Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker stated that the impact of border delays on a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that we will see production stops at our plant in an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other British automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a hard exit from the EU without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s production facility is operated on a just-in-time basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock at the Derbyshire plant that lasts more than a day, the company explained, which is why production needs to be interrupted.
Clark said that Theresa May’s Chequers plan on future relations with the EU “is designed precisely to avoid such border controls.”
"We need a deal, we want the best deal that will allow us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains to date.”
Toyota was unable to specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the Unite trade union at work, explained that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred by another week,” while the dispute over the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continued, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein has oversight of the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s electoral interference, links between Trump’s advisors and Russia, as well as a potential presidential impediment.
The question of whether Trump would fire the Deputy Justice Minister and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his talks with Trump as well as the impeachment of the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday as new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time, was announced for next Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to dismiss Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the U.S. Senate Judicial Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the full vote of the Senate.
Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
She responded to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein: “A date has not yet been set for this, it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
It will show, but I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference of the White House since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the low frequency of press conferences was not due to an aversion to the TV reporters’ “effect hassle,” but admitted: “I would not deny that they are doing effect hassle.”
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president is doing more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him,” she said, without providing any exact evidence: “We looked at these numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “when the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that often, and you've seen that we've done that many times in the last few weeks, and that's going to take the place of the press conference, if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is the case when he made an out-of-the-box and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Health Minister Writes About Brexit Concerns to Scottish NHS Workers
The Minister of Health appeals to people from abroad who work at Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they remain in the country after Brexit.
Scottish Parliament member Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to pay the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in the decentralized public service of Scotland.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, exit negotiations between the UK and the EU were continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know what a disturbing time this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home, and we would be very happy if you stayed here."
Christion Abercrombie Succeeded in Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
The linebacker of the Tennessee State Tigers Christion Abercrombie was subjected to emergency surgery, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State after a head injury he sustained on Saturday in the 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before he was placed on a carrier and transported for further investigations.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details on the nature or extent of the injury are yet known” and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called Redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after he switched from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, bringing his total to 18 tackles in the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp tax for buying real estate in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp tax in the future for buying real estate in the UK. The additional income will benefit the homeless according to the new plans of the Conservative Party
This move is aimed at curbing the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in stamp fee will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee when buying real estate in the UK, with the extra income to benefit the homeless.
This move represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, who promises to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp tax is levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom and the additional income is to be paid to the government campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which is levied in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase on second homes and rented residential properties introduced two years ago, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to increase revenues by up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors who are not based in the UK, which will drive prices up and make it more difficult for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, became “ghost cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson voted for a reduction in stamp tax to allow more young people the first home.
He accused construction companies of upholding property prices by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “living shame.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced a buzzing series of housing reform proposals ranging from leasing to banning evictions for no valid reason.
He also wants to give councillors more authority to build new apartments.
“Last year, I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of making life better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that for individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, it is just as easy to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of a home has become too distant for too many people, and the unworthiness of homelessness remains too big a problem.”
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says that his ‘greatest goal’ is to eventually become the manager of the Scottish team.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the club from the north-east of England, which is currently in third place in the League One and lacks three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But as a child I have often seen Scotland playing with my father in Hampden and that’s something that always pulls me back.
This would only be possible if I were successful in the management of the club.”
Ross's predecessors in the role as manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after previously rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success will be measured at the moment by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and opportunities in this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only see my time here as a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross has a three-year management career, after a period as deputy boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month job as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation to win the championship in the following season.
Ross says he is now feeling more comfortable than ever in his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“That was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls when he took over Alloa’s responsibility.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds weird, as I wasn’t doing badly, was able to live well and experienced some very pleasant high stages.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through the stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my skin as an adult in my whole life.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday 30 September between 12:00 and 13:00 BST on Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, according to a study
The summer heatwave has missed the revenues of Britain’s crisis-ridden pubs an upswing, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
Pub and bar companies recorded sales growth of 2.7 percent in July, but restaurants revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the management consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, explained: “Continued sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected continued participation in the World Cup meant July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, where pubs saw sales increase by 2.8 percent, but restaurant hit even harder.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed the best performance by far, with area-adjusted revenue growth rising higher than it fell at restaurants.
Pubs focused on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent in the month, while food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreational and hospitality industry analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather and influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-focused companies and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the much-needed breathing break.”
Overall revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.
The industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active companies with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is the recognized industry benchmark.

One in five children, some just 11 years old, create accounts on social media that can keep it a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “fake insta” accounts, based on the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “main account” that they can show their parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who asked others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
HMC Chairman Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes 'Voice of Athletes' in Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Board.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from her extensive international experience over the last decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly from her choice to the Council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200- and 400-metre distance at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, named a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and now often appears as a BBC expert, was unable to run after a transient circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I will recover.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and do exercises of agility today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!”
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows on the net creates excitement
A manufacturer of milk pumps caused excitement on the net with an advertising clip in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
For the launch of the "world's first low-noise portable milk pump", consumer technology manufacturer Elvie released a music video that was not quite serious in order to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines like, “Yes, I milk, but you don’t see a cock on me” or “if you haven’t noticed, these are not udders but my breasts.”
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the ads posted on the company’s Facebook page have sparked a controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions among viewers, many of whom say it undermines the “terribles” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
"Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young are taken away from them within a few days of birth," the statement said.
Elvie's breast pump subtly fits in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment read: “Remarkably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don’t we use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another person added: “Such a non-realistic advertisement.”
Others defended the ads and one woman admitted that she found the song “hilarious.”
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a little crazy, but I’m not trying to over-interpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often in the workplace or on toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discrete pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on breastfeeding pumps and all the challenges involved, while at the same time presenting in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump makes possible.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared as a two-time mother on the catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly taken to a tent city on the Texan border
The number of migrant children interned is more than ever before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, among other things as tightened rhetoric and measures by the Trump administration have made it harder to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers were themselves illegal immigrants and are now afraid to become the target for expulsion themselves when they report to accommodate a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal agencies announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to hand over their fingerprints and share that data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Customs Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who had applied for the care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous entries in the criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of people who are either self-caregivers or members of a caregiver’s household reside illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to pursue these people,” Albence said.
In order to speed up the handling of children’s cases, officials introduced new rules that, according to staff at the accommodations, require some children to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days after custody, which was the standard before.
Many will appear via video and not in person to stand up for their legal status in front of an immigration judge.
In case of negative decisions, the person is quickly deported.
The longer these children stay in custody, the more likely it is, according to the housing staff, as well as reports made known in the last month from the system, that they become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to break out.
Defenders say these concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems that are more easily overlooked due to size.
They also explained that it can increase trauma that many of the children already suffer from if they are taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria Calls on American, French and Turkish ‘Occupation Forces’ to Withdraw Immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the civil war in the country now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, stated that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil with the pretext of fighting terrorism and are “treated accordingly.”
“You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more people have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed” by both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were met and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prevent the refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to enable returning home,” he said.
“They are politicising a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid will be granted to Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, was an opportunity for advancing political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive by the Russian-backed Syrian forces towards the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action will be taken against jihadists, including fighters of the Al Qaeda-aligned Nusra Front, which will “be wiped out.”
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of government and opposition to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem cited the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to the “revision of the articles of the current constitution” and warning against interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal spectators probably hope, an impeachment or scandal ended his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time.”
So far, there are no signs that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-time turn-on rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reached an average of 2.4 million viewers at the best time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the ratings with you to 3.5 million viewers on nights with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series Designated Survivor about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-time comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
She asked him why.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
Chaos has an entertainment value.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike anything found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible reunification of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it’s also about being an informed citizen when you realize you’ve already watched six hours of an expert round discussing Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “Deep Background” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000-dollar ostrich-leather bomber jacket (according to the Washington Post a “clothing rich in self-evaluation,” or the effects of Stormy Daniel.

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crept in and looked at MSNBC while recording CNN at the same time.
He simply couldn’t get rid of the screen, not when Judge Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we did all those crazy shows and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization’,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flood the narrowest races for seats in Congress in the midterm elections
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the constituency that led to two incumbents in the race for the same seat.
The recently redrawn suburban district in Pittsburg lets Democrat Conor Lamb compete, who won his seat in another district in the course of a special election last spring.
Lamb competes against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, who strongly overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered a swap of campaign funding between the parties’ major financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a brief victory in a much-regarded special election in March for the state's 18th constituency.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade, and Trump won a 20-percent lead there.
Politicians give the Democrats easy leadership.
The U.S. examined El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then resigned
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering great resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign representations from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the ministry, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, it was only in the case of El Salvador that penalties were considered, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar gathering in the previous year and was a step forward in efforts to stop migrants from moving towards the US.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and so effectively ended the consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to set a signal for the importance the government gives to the assembly, according to diplomats.
The three American diplomatic representatives are silently returning to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh communications or penalties from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible judicial impediment, for which there is now sufficient evidence in public.
Mueller is also investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the American elections.
Should Congressional majority change, Trump would be faced with an organ that would force him to be held accountable at the exact time he drives by to step back before voters; and possibly before a jury.
These are many ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler if only the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the inexorable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do when Trump dismisses Deputy Minister of Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Teufel’s kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he proposed secretly recording the president and speculating whether he was inappropriate for the office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair or he is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony in office?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will force Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we will have a long winter ahead.
But I don’t think we’re going to fail because of what I’ve learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic before the match against Vienna
The Rangers will receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2-2 tie against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger ones.
“That was an important point for us, because Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we can make something of it and we drove home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
Hopefully we get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they’ve scored a good result in the last game, but I’m sure we can go through this with the audience behind us and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Anxiety about retirement pensions leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to lead the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Nationwide’s Life Insurance Division.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include a traditional care insurance, a hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Apply litigation at the last minute.
Set up a guardianship so that you can hire a trusted person to monitor your medical care and make sure the health care professionals meet your wishes should you be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid should you not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so you’re ready.

Man in Ilfracombe shot several times with an air rifle
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after a job with friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shots, which occurred around 02:30 of British time, as a “random act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to the authorities.
Due to the failure of communication systems, auxiliaries were unable to obtain information from the Donggala District, an area north of Palu, located closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a governmental district that extends to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi over a coastal section of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the administrative district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the Central Sulawesi economy, especially the Donggala coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it mainly focuses on Morovali, on the opposite Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Civil Protection Agency.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, West Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Fire Ring, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on 26 December that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes rocked the west coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 rocked southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 deaths.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, which destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya district of Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the popular Indonesian island of Lombok and claimed over 500 lives, especially on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested for domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and former candidate for vice president, was arrested on charges of bodily injury.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting, and resistance to state power, according to a report released by Alaska police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a friend when they wanted to contact the police.
Palin, according to KTUU, is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 deposit has been levied.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he replied with “Not guilty, quite sure,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A crimes, which can be punished with up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which can be punished with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that any criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being brought before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under narcotic influence in connection with the incident.
His friend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people died in an earthquake that shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-strong quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are interrupted and the number of deaths is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On social networks, videos circulate from the time the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The New York State Attorney’s Office calls for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terrorist attack, which cost eight lives. This is a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov has been charged with using a rented pickup from the Home Depot hardware chain for a terrorist attack, during which he raced on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October, driving over pedestrians and cyclists in the process.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight orers “targeted” and “consciously” inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the letter of intent for the death penalty demand filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punished with death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigation sworn-in Saipov filed a 22-point indictment that included eight charges of murder against the background of organized crime, usually used by state lawyers in cases of organized crime, as well as an indictment of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “fundamental planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the way in which Saipov carried out the act as “disgusting, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and losses on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For more than a decade, the southern district of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers and finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York in a federal offence was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, witnessed a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court records.
He said before investigators that he felt good about what he did, according to the police.
Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked police to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He declared himself not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “of course disappointed” because of the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma that all parties suffer,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A Conservative Party MP Calls for NIGEL FARAGE to Delegate Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest at the Tories conference.
Ukip’s former head of the party stated that politicians “must feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham protesters that the UK would be “already out” if Farage were Brexit minister.
The challenge May faces in reconciling her deeply divided parties was exacerbated by the fact that members of her party who are in favour of remaining in the EU participated in a separate demonstration against Brexit that took place in the city.
The prime minister has trouble keeping her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks from Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that, despite the counter-reactions, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour party to decide between her package and the “chaos”.
At the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone explained that Chequers belonged to the trash.
He suggested that Farage should have been appointed as a peer and that he should have been responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for it, we would already be out,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added, “I’ll stand up for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.”
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
The Brexit supporter of conservative Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, explaining to reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who actually go through the streets and make sure we are elected.
Please give up chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, she continued, “Prime Ministers will keep their jobs if you keep their promises.”
Farage stated in a speech that politicians must “feel the pressure” if they are just about to cheat on the 2016 referendum decision.
“It’s a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat on Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘That won’t get you away with that.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he continued: “I want you to let our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country that helped us win the referendum and will never come to rest unless we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party that was launched this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can ensure that the IT systems, as well as all the technology for Canada Plus, are available for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ presidential candidate
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “examine the presidential candidacy closely” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently in the race for re-election for the Senate against Massachusetts Republican MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign team in 2016.
She was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people in attendance asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it was time for women to “go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after death shots on LSU player Sims
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the case of deadly shots on LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They had released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man to be seen on the recordings.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a headshot injury and died as a result of this injury,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene of a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incidents and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter-sized Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting lineups last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship title after his team left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the time Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes stall orders would play a big role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he were leading Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first into the box and let Hamilton get into traffic at the end of the field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-to-wheel maneuver, in which the Ferrari pilot reluctantly released the inside, risking two moves to defend the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in one of the back seats of the field and was seventh on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race as he stopped at his tires to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th lap and failed to take a step in the remaining eight laps, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day as Valtteri did an excellent job all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me by.
The team has done an excellent job of achieving a double victory,” Hamilton said.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election event on Saturday, who insisted not to pass on Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the Senate events show that people are “dangerous, evil, and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days, is seeing the anger, seeing people who are angry and mean and vicious and dishonest,” he said.
“If you look at the leaks and say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think about your answer... You published the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Okay, a minute, please.
“No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the senator’s voice.
Feinstein was credited with the letter with Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and it was released in early September, but Feinstein denies that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I met her request for secrecy.”
Her denial didn’t seem to be well received by the president, who said on Saturday night at the campaign event: “I’ll tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his continuous defense of the judge candidate, who is accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed to be using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the meanness, the evilness, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for the defeat in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday by a 5:3 win back in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead early on with two goals, after hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compensated for the home team before Dwyer restored the Giants’ leadership.
Francois Bouchard competed for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee unexpectedly on Friday night 2-1 in Belfast, the third defeat in the Elite League in the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the three previous games.
Dwyer's opening gate came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a Kendall McFaull presentation. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to its balancing gate after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the lead of the Giants before the half-time break, when he scored his second goal of the evening shortly before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard rebalanced with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, then Nielsen secured his team with a fifth goal after just under half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Air traffic controller died after making sure hundreds of people in an airplane escaped the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found the death to safely launch an airplane with hundreds of people on board.
Over 800 people died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was rocked on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save your lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for the Indonesian air safety service, said that this decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We provided a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this news,” he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the number of deaths could rise to several thousand, and the country’s civil protection authority said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to increase because many bodies are still under the debris, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, saying in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work all day and night to complete all the tasks that come with the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” the CNN said.
Indonesia was already shaken by earthquakes in Lombok this year, which killed over 550 people.
Air Niugini Reports Missing Person After Aircraft Crash in Lagoon
The airline carrying out the flight, which crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they can’t say anything about a passenger’s whereabouts until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, but they were in stable condition.
The cause and the exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying out of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through hip-deep water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve a mooring rushed to help with an inflatable boat to take people to the shore before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in the crashes of Papua New Guinea-registered airlines, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night when a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded on Saturday its evidence in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banning a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on their death night using cell phone calls.
Rowlett said he received position data from various phones that showed Tellis was dating Chambers on the evening of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the period he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness stand on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was at Sanford's pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied "because my pick-up was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers at the time of her death for two weeks.
However, cell phone records indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chamber's death, Tellis unlocked their messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone.
“He cut them out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to start its pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then be before the jury that day.
The High Breed: What Is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after “racist” SMS
A New York-based nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misguided message from the mother complaining that she was “yet a black woman.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to a “extortion.”
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that the new day-to-day mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day at work in 2016.
“NO EEEEEEEEEE, NO MORE A BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognizing her faux pas, the "embarrassingly touched" Plasco-Flaxman dismissed Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American nurse had done a bad job and she was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal and claims compensation for the $350 per day she would have spent over six months the job for which she had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the racism allegations, arguing that the dismissal was the reasonable step, as they feared Maurice would not be able to trust them anymore after insulting them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone who was rude to them, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to a “extortion,” stating that his wife is expecting a baby in just two months and is “in a difficult situation.”
“Do you want to prosecute such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the lawsuit continues, the couple was quickly convicted in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it was published.
Today it’s very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children’s book, would have had no problem with having his work rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the release was “bitter sweet” after his death last year.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she describes as a “very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t brag,” Jankel said.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child that does something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success like this.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself was responsible for his success.
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looks really bad and that the doctors gave her little chances,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I received the call from Nad, where he told me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly dropped and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I could do nothing but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to break up.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers who did not know what she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran all the time over my cheeks.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight when I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women hang up cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones in suicide try to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counselling centers.
Davis's son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son had a promising career as a chef and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten up a room.”
However, he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler's body was found after the suicide of his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, “I’m always afraid that could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was dating for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed,” she explained.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was at the bottom of his mind, and when the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't look them in the eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that had to go through: “It’s ripping a huge hole into the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to go ahead and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on hold as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something like that that he asked for, that is, a time-limited and limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would “break apart” in the party’s standstill.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance can be attributed solely to the timing.
The midterm elections on November 6 are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans scored poorly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husbands to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
The Senate currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to decide on equal votes and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'sinks' under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, who relies on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, stated that 1127 defectors were registered last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher prices of human traffickers as the main factors.
Pyongyang did not publicly comment on this.
The vast majority of defectors from the north are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Since the end of the Korean War in 1953, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most are fleeing across China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often leads them back by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work towards a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused American sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without trusting the US, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh “Hysterical” and Says He Is Not Suitable for Supreme Court Office
The minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was characterly unsuitable for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I could not deny the impression that a woman who acted in this way had been called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied any allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he almost screamed and was about to burst into tears as he talked about his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated infamy” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves he can’t serve in the Supreme Court because it shows he’s biased towards Democrats.
“I believe that with these statements and the way in which he came across the Clintons and Democrats, he has declared himself unfit,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to revoke Kavanaugh from office if he were to be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judgeship,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington D.C.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision, Roe v. Wade, as he is assessed as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh ruled out questions as to whether he would revise certain Supreme Court decisions.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person to go to this court and expect us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she said, “You may think you’re sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keep talking.
I found it awesome.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger and was pulled into a stairwell by an older woman, an undercooled manager I was always scared of.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
"They don't know you're pissed off.
They believe that you are sad and will be satisfied with themselves because they believe you have gone to the substance.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Colorado congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy himself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Somebody called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the election campaign was already advanced, she was behind in raising funds, and she vowed not to run if she didn’t get 2 million dollars together.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters who donated $1,000 to men only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked herself.
She was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made raising funds and direct addressing the voters instead of the delegates so difficult, as well as the anger over sexism, that she was close to tears.
“You could have assumed that I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have believed that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my gravestone.
“She was crying?”
Why Beijing Could Benefit From US-China Trade War
The opening ointments of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a gap between the countries in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the American president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he fined key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the US.
Beijing retaliated in the same way each time and recently levied penal duties of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China swore to answer every measure of the US and it is unlikely that the world’s second largest economic power will soon stumble.
Moving Washington in would mean giving in, but a public nod to the U.S. would be far too disgraceful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick policy decision could create the conditions for economic turmoil in either Washington or Beijing is actually far more dangerous than many observers have previously realized,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Think Tank Center for New American Security.
Syria is ‘ready’ to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, thanks to progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that had their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomed assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance from countries that had supported the insurrection.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the Ryder Cup 2018 and defeated Team USA with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, sunk his tee on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 against the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garcia, veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I couldn’t hold back today.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I’m so happy to win the trophy back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” said emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual encounters.
I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, which I’ve been watching on television since I was a child,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup balance of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding the fairways throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who made top-class performances throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk, after a disappointing performance by his team, said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All of his 12 players did a good job.
We’re going to regroup, I’m going to talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’re going to look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated.”
Update on the red tide: concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota are decreasing
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that there is a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more fragile flowering conditions are recorded in the areas of the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier districts, indicating declining concentrations.
A red algae blossom extends over approximately 130 miles of coastline from the north of Pinellas to the south of the Lee district.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough, but in fewer places compared to the previous week.
A red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
Last week, average concentrations in or off the coast of the Pinellas district were reported, low to high concentrations off the coast of the Manatee district, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of the Charlotte district, background to high concentrations in or off the coast of the Lee district, and low concentrations in the Collier district.
Respiratory complaints continue to be reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No new respiratory problems were reported in northwest Florida over the past week.
