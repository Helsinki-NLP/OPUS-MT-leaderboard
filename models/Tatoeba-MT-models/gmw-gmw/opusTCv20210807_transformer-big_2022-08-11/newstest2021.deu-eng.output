Biker reacts lightning-fast and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a road accident occurred on the road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
The driver overlooks the biker.
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn her VW from Merklingen towards Machtolsheim, coming to the left on the national road 1230.
She overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist coming from Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away during the collision
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but still stripped it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the stirring process, the hand and foot brake levers on the Suzuki were torn down and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Present in his mind, he drove his motorcycle in the green stiffness next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury at the Bei and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are not allowed to leave the company.
A security guard monitors the outing ban.
A total of 174 harvesters were tested positive for the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as the Landratsamt Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, in order to avoid further spread, we must take this step to protect the population," Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU) explained.
Previously, seven employees had been infected in the company - this was the reason for the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay glasses.
Mamming is a rural community of about 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to citizens to keep calm: “According to our information, this is a closed circle of people.”
In the farm, infected people were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
The Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the housing of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly avenged if such local infections are to be resolved and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary managing director of the Greens.
The SPD sees this very similarly: "We have already demanded a special control program for farms with harvest workers after the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"It is precisely the hygiene conditions in the workplace and the living conditions that must be monitored sharply from our point of view.
This obviously did not happen.”
The outbreak came “with an announcement.”
Underground station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls after Schubser in the track bed
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, there was a dispute between two youth groups at Aidenbachstraße subway station around 16.15.
A passerby alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to the first investigation, a Munich man (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
Persons from the group of the 17-year-old helped the fallen man climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming railway.
According to the police, there were disputes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene, but his personalities could be determined afterwards.
He was accompanied by his father to the 29th Inspectorate.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for bodily injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of data
Data retention is currently suspended.
According to a media report, however, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended retention of data - instead of the planned ten weeks for half a year.
Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a quick change of law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to “already make urgently needed adjustments to the law,” the newspaper quotes from the letter.
The storage of data is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected to do so.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments beforehand, so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it would only be possible to reasonably examine whether legal adjustments would be necessary if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already advocated a retention of data in June.
NBA: Strip club troubles for Clipper star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), a Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional, is said to have left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN, is back in isloation, is teased daily on Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, Sweet Lou, as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, N.R.) have the best wings in town".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has prescribed Williams a 10-day quarantine.
The Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting in the night on Friday.
Söder expresses himself after mass infection on the corona situation
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a testoffensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has scared authorities and politics.
The large vegetable farm currently employs nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries, more than a third have become infected with the coronavirus.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed with a fence.
No one is allowed to leave the area, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the more than 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the county office so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Conscience": Confession of the alleged arsonist of Nantes
"My client has been shown to be cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: “He deeply regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him.”
"His mandate is plagued by guilt and is greatly affected by the extent of the destruction."
In the event of a conviction, the man is threatened with ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged in a fire on Saturday last week.
The fire had erupted in three far-off places in the church.
Laboratory tests reinforced the suspicion of arson.
The suspect was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly fell into the spotlight of the investigators.
Debate on the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates final facts,” Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that can most likely become dangerous in Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, there is no way around the debate whether it is necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors in associations that want to break into this phalanx."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of moving investment fences around the business location of the Bundesliga in a European single market," said Grindel.
The former head of the DFB sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million euros and RB Leipzig of 300 million euros.
The differences are enormous among the first three clubs.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old explained.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and stabbed it through to the press rather than addressing me,” Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It has already occupied me very much humanly.”
He received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” Grindel said.
"The ominous watch gift was completely transparent and unscrupulous.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
“He never made a secret of the gift,” the 58-year-old said.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
Black Lives Matter: Wounded and a Dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have spiked again through Donald Trump’s use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between demonstrators and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was killed by shots while a demonstration train was just crossing a crossroads.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officials, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly disassembled protesters.
Hundreds of partially armed protesters marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group calling himself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and died in the course of a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
Police said they had a suspect in custody.
She has not yet provided further details of the circumstances of the act.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said he was, like many in the city, “consoling and disconcerting” about what had happened.
In the American metropolis of Seattle, protesters also clashed with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to construction cars in front of a youth prison, and the police used blend grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resistance to police officers or personal injury.
In Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters slammed windows, fired fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday evening.
The fire was quickly quenched.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to the hospital.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court and a fire was set, police said.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the large sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without a Rakoczy party.
But: Even though the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy-Ball or Festzug burn, many came to their expense in the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have succeeded in spreading Rakoczy-Flair," says curator director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when only the historical ones were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time in the corona year.
The couple have made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watch the historical while strolling and listen to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She doesn’t miss the crowds that otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
But she lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale on Friday evening as well as the historic parade and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"It's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year,” he said.
Rakoczy ride tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the parade in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
“It’s harder, or we’ll have it easier,” she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrill will take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break 2021, a Rakoczy ride tournament will take place again.
28 Corona cases in Spanish second-ligist Fuenlabrada
Spanish football second-ligist CF Fuenlabrada is getting deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer had flown from close to Madrid despite first corona cases on July 20 to a game in the city of A Coruna, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name southwest of Madrid had so far the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the descent into the B-group of the Second League threatens.
Last Monday’s match against Deportivo La Coruna was cancelled at the last moment, prosecutors are investigating a possible public health offense, the top sports agency CSD is considering the club’s forced decline.
The players and other team members sit in a quarantine hotel.
"Until the sixth day of quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel or gel," the sports newspaper AS wrote.
Photos show players hanging underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was also not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It’s neither good nor enough, he said.
The club said they were happy with the hotel.
The accusation of intentionally endangering public health was rejected by the club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas.
It did not violate the Corona rules established by the football association, the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, emphasized, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported.
Before the departure, there were four infected persons, but they were all isolated and did not travel with them.
Just before Monday’s flight to A Coruna, all players and team members have been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruna, five or six other team members of the Corona test were positive.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the kick-off, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must capture horses at steam roof
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, just before 6 am, a road user informed two free-running horses on the feeder between the estuary of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the motorway connection Theres.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already back between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officials could gain the trust of the horses shortly before steaming, they were able to put down a rope carried in the patrol car.
Cycling professional Tony Martin: career continuation imaginable
Time driving specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time world champion Tony Martin can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just setting out the framework conditions with the team, how and in what form it could continue," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered finishing his career after this year before the corona break.
Negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as a father of a little daughter, I think: What if?”
The cyclist admitted that there were aspects with which he was increasingly having difficulty.
"But it was good for me to remember from the corona time, what I have in cycling and how much I enjoy it."
The time trial specialist returns to the competition at the Tour de l'Ain (5th to 9th August).

Schönthal - Several, mostly young people died in accidents on Bavaria's streets over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was caught on Saturday near Schönthal (County of Cham) by a car that came on the counter lane.
Why the car hit the counter lane was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday a 22-year-old collided on his machine with a horse-drawn carriage.
According to police, he was downhill at Beilngries.
In a left turn, he clashed against the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the accident site.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, a man became heavy and a man slightly injured, the police said.
In another fatal accident in the Upper Palatinate Bad Kötzting an 18-year-old died.
He lay down on a road the night before Sunday and was overrun by a 42-year-old driver.
According to the police, the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver was unable to brake in time.
At Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau County) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker bounced in a right turn, despite full braking, frontally against a car.
He died at the accident site.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavarian Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced in August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister pointed to extensive investments such as underride protection on boards and the defusing of dangerous curves.
“We have achieved a lot in recent years for the safety of motorcyclists,” the letter said.
“The number of motorized two-wheelers killed decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011.”
Kovac test with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be guesting at the Hessen, the former club of the Croats, on August 1st at 6:00 p.m.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only tough test before the Europa League backlash against FC Basel (6 August).
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter is held without spectators.
“We are especially looking forward to this game.
It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
This is an interesting test, the 48-year-old said.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had trained the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to the victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the match against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing you again with Niko Kovac,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian in the concord.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eighth-final game against Basel in their own stadium with 0-3.

Argentina rejects offer of creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
“This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair,” a statement said.
“While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors.”
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer viable under the current conditions.
That is why Argentina is demanding that its private creditors renounce part of its claims of around $66 billion (about €59 billion).
If no agreement is reached, the country threatens the state again.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government remains on its last offer and is unwilling to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina failed to settle interest claims of $503 million, resulting in a limited default.
Arrived professionally - privately not yet
"It's going super well" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very fast: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up the job, the normal daily business is already running at full speed.
“I still have to arrive privately,” she explains in a conversation with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfinger.
Currently, she and her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg, are looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband could still apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31.2 and 11.2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she now also has a place to stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course been a notion for a long time.
During visits on site with her family in the past months, she then remarked: "Eggenfelden is a really nice small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career also plays a central role in her home state of Lower Bavaria: After studying law in Passau, she completed her referendariat and her 2nd state exam in Regensburg.
After several posts as a notarisssor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also shouldered the doctorate in labour law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, eventually moving to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notaries.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised due to Lutz Feller’s approaching retirement, she saw the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of their predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and has a compliment for the team of the law firm: "It is going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on well-received procedures here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
When it comes to kindergarten and cribs, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging trails in the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The biggest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory, we are planning according to the current status with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," said Borussia Dortmund Managing Director Carsten Cramer.
Normally, the arena in the district city holds just over 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In last season’s ghost games caused by the corona pandemic, the BVB lost around four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the around 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away."
In the face of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side length first."
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people in Germany alone are in short-term employment, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their salary partial renunciation, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary renunciation has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short-time work".
Tiny miracles: early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a Packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of around 400 early babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children’s Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few – like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael – are extreme lightweights with not even one kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early born that neither lungs, intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Your skin is sometimes so delicate that it could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-windles specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be on voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
“Even if they don’t scream as loudly as big babies.”
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th classes of the St. James’s Gymnasium in Abtsgmünd shortly before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to talk to the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance via Skype.
The idea for the performance format from the current corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted with the enrichment of the classroom.
Even though all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional stimuli, you can also see the potential for contact in the schools in the theatre.
“If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game’s operation,” said director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: The TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty potential opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup have been determined.
The lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening at the ARD-Sportschau.
Because the participant field is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should Zweitliga-Anstieg Würzburg reach the final, Sixty would already qualify for the first round in the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to prevail in the final game against regional league player Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will take place between 11 and 14 September and thus one week before the start of the third league.
Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, her spokeswoman for the German press agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the southern epic "Vom Winde weht" (1939).

"Road to Timmendorf": Beachvolleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale on comeback
The World Cup second Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semi-finals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Most recently, Thole/Wickler had played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final game on the Rhine, her victors Ehlers/Flüggen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played at the beginning of September in Timmendorfer Strand: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of 'fig leaf'
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" from the FDP's point of view and does not change the character of the party.
“The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD,” said FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser to the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Board of Directors had decided in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburg state parliament.
“If the AfD were really about removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long since been excluded,” Strasser said.
“There is no political will in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party.”
Similarly, CSU secretary general Markus Blume said: "That Andreas Kalbitz now remains excluded says nothing and does not change," he told the "Welt am Sonntag".
Rather, it speaks volumes of how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist still has in the middle of the AfD.
Blume expects the AfD to fall below five percent in elections in the future.
“The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered.”
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons for the officially disbanded "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and group chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the swelling as a "secure right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD Federal Board of Directors had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz did not specify earlier membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreuen Deutsche Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, whether with or without calibre.”
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing is weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen force is clear.
They want to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar,” Walter said.
“The AfD is not going to let go of the ghosts that it called.
A throw out does not change anything," commented the Brandenburg SPD secretary-general Erik Stohn on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD-Landesverband and the faction have remained their right-wing leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea have fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
That is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, the network operator Tennet said in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet network, have fed in an additional 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North and Baltic Sea comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms increase production capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1,270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; it is 7.1 gigawatts, according to Tennet.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections by then,” said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot even use their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which is equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th anniversary.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery was the association "Sandtogether".
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
“We really did not make this decision easy for ourselves and – knowing how difficult it is economically for the parties involved – hoped until the last minute,” said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partisan).
“Ultimately, however, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as organizers.”
If tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and into the festival tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current corona protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately.
Rumberg was comforted for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary, including the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four victories on the weekend at four starts.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unable to beat in the Grand Prix Special and the Kür on Sunday.
At the 15-year-old mare Weihegold Werth prevailed on Sunday in the special against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
On Saturday, the German was clearly in front of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first cure ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago Werth had won all the important four tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
Worms University of Applied Sciences goes further into the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and starts in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to enable the start of studies not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, capacities are equally utilised both at the university and at the DFS Air Traffic Control Academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students have been studying Air Traffic Management at the University of Applied Sciences Worms.
Nine students started this year.
So far, the experience of the DFS has been very positive, and the student’s performance has been excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
“In these times, funding is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to continue fulfilling our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Director of DFS at the time of signing the contract.
"For the DFS, the foundation professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, technically comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue to cooperate well with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University of Applied Sciences, also underlines this: “The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor programme Air Traffic Management".
For the University of Worms, the trust of the German Air Traffic Control is both motivation and obligation to further develop its teaching and research competence in the fields of the future of aviation.
In the service for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first foundation professorship for a dual degree program.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Further Education and Culture, emphasises: "The Worms University of Applied Sciences has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today’s signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university.”
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
About 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon, the A 45 motorway in the direction of Aschaffenburg was completely closed, because after a traffic accident the rescue helicopter was in use.
A 76-year-old man drove a Ford straight in the turn at the exit Alzenau-Mitte at around 12.40 and landed at the board.
The impact triggered the front airbags, the driver suffered minor injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
Police are currently assuming that there is no risk of death.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2,000 euros, had to be towed away.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry back to light.
Law tightening is imminent.
Are they right, and will they?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to examine other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry for industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers are already warning against restricting employment contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to adopt a law of salvation on Wednesday.
Major slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel during slaughter, dismantling and meat processing.
To this end, the use of employment contractors and temporary workers should be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the DPA: "Take your finger away from a general restriction on employment contracts and employee leave if you don't want to quell the economy completely."
Work contracts are, for example, the basis for their value creation at the customer for large areas of the craftsmanship, construction industry and plant construction.
“The misdeeds of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument.”
Heil assured: “My goal is not to ban contracts of work everywhere in the German economy.”
Work contracts make sense.
“When an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a safety system, it is a normal contract of work.”
The German meat industry considers a ban on contracts for work and temporary work to be unconstitutional in its sector alone.
It is not possible to explain why in the future, when portioning and packaging cheese should apply different labor law than in the case of sausage, it says in a statement on the bill, as the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
In many cases, Eastern European employees from contracting companies worked in the industry 16 hours a day, following the results of an examination by the NRW Occupational Health and Safety Administration.
Often they didn’t have a break.
Salary was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively sharp law had already entered into force in 2017 for the meat industry.
But by “tricky constructions” they were circumvented.
“Now we need to clean up fundamentally.”
The politician announced: “The Occupational Health and Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that affect not only the meat industry – for example, higher inspection rates for Occupational Safety or clear criteria for community accommodations.”
The draft present in the DPA includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Occupational Safety Act.
Brandenburg's consumer protection minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes that more intensive controls are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to do even more controls in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example animal transports," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people have died in the crash of an ultralight plane on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people were rescued in the accident, a spokesman for the district control center Wesel said.
A parachute was found at the accident site, police said.
The Rheinische Post reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Detailed details were not initially known.
The eviction of Frankfurt Opera Square is peaceful
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opera Square in the night on Sunday also went peacefully.
Recently, a few dozen people were still on the square, but left him before the curfew at 1 a.m.
The police had been in use since the early evening with numerous officials, throughout the city area there was a larger number of police.
This weekend, for the first time, there was a ban on treading the operatic square, where riots had occurred a week ago.
Police officers were attacked with bottles out of the crowd.
At least five officers were injured after police entries, several police vehicles were damaged.
Saturday night was also quiet.
Young woman injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered severe injuries on Sunday around 13.25.
She was taken to the hospital in Kassel.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for potential passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on the Bundesstraße 83 in the direction of her home town of Hümme, when her car came off the road from an unexplained cause and crossed over several times.
In order to save the injured, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether anyone was still in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was scanned from the rotary ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for people.
However, the forces did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The injured person was taken by ambulance to the hospital in Kassel for further care.
Nearly 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Champion in Italy
After a redeeming goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto of the club's history perfect with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genua.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer in first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Juventus was harmless in the first half, despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo hit with the last action after a free-kick variant.
A match from Miralem Pjanic exploited the 35-year-old directly from the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted.
This secured the glareless but decisive success.
The foulelfmeter in the 89th minute, which was dropped to the latte, was probably only Ronaldo himself, with a view to the score of the goalkeeper.
“It’s complicated to stay on ball level mentally and physically for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum is changing very easily,” said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1-2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Due to the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve’s reassuring lead at the top of the table was ultimately due to the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will still be the top scorer is questionable.
After all, while the Portuguese superstar so far scored 31 goals, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already 34 goals in his account after his three-seater pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuain.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title opportunity.
Juventus is in the Champions League's eighth final, but has to make up for a 0-1 defeat against Olympique Lyon on August 7 to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: In the past year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparable figures for the years before, but the rapists are increasingly making the judicial authorities work: In 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted between the public prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim for illegal races, one year later it was already 252 and in the current year up to the beginning of June 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the SPD of the Landtag.
In most cases, the drivers have spontaneously competed against each other or they have taken the flight from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
At the wheel were mainly German men between the ages of 18 and 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonment sentences have been pronounced.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
On the contrary, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
The highway 8 is particularly popular with racers. Drivers brake traffic there again and again in order to get space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, there is an attempt to brake the razors on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and upbeat sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would get rid of this problem on motorways," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you weren't allowed to travel here and there legally with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "Whoever in this way transcends all rules and puts not only his own life, but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly reachable with reason".
ADAC calls for more police action
This is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that rasers cannot be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-speed force fair to become more painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nightly crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall, and lay on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 more people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, tighter penalties are not necessary: “legislative action is not seen in order to sanction illegal automobile races harder,” says the paper of the Interior Ministry.
Blue light from 23 July: Thirst burglar steals drinks from snacks
A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Calw district) and stole drinks and cash.

There he noticed a man who used drinks at the refrigerator and then left the snack through a previously knocked-in front door.
The perpetrator fled in the direction of the meadows behind the snack.
According to the police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: he is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and has a strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hooded sweater, black pants and bright shoes.
Other witnesses are being taken by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann won his second day on the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfälzer from Team Bora-hansgrohe prevailed in the mass sprint on the 109-kilometre long section with start and finish in Hermannstadt, after already winning a stage on Saturday.
It was season three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall standings his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had decided in the morning sovereignly the mountain time driving for himself and thus took the lead in the ranking.
Only 104 drivers were in the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the new season with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” the 26-year-old said.
300 meters before the finish he simply put on his sprint, "and it worked perfectly."
According to the rules of the UCI, a corona test was carried out for all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.
Headquarters gave instructions on lay reanimation
Dusseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Dusseldorf-Garath.
In an apartment building, a child (4) was suddenly lying alive in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived at just before 1 p.m.
“A control dispatcher immediately gave instructions on layman reanimation,” a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The arriving rescuers took on the revival measures a little later.
The child in danger of life was transported to the hospital under resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police routinely investigated the accident.
The fire department spokesman said: “We are expecting a tragic accident in the apartment.”
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1,100 people
Hundreds of cars and at times over 1,000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture store.
The police carried out their announcement to control such events more.
A big tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (25 July 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police in Central Franconia, an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstädter Straße was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 10:30 p.m.
The police then carried out a number of vehicle inspections.
Recently, the police announced that they wanted to take more action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officials counted to the top about 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people, the police accounted for.
However, only a small proportion of those present are assigned to the “autoposer” and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene followed the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons on site, it can be assumed that these were mainly spectators.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-site controls were completed at 1:00 a.m.
All in all, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the licence had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
“The police bureau in Mittelfranken will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, also in connection with the advent of spectators,” it said.
The agency News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the involved towing company: "They all have beautiful rims, which we must not scratch", says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company must take care not to cause any damage.
“Young people should get their cars back unharmed.”
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of misuse of short-term worker money.
“This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-term employment,” said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive board responsible for the operative business, to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When at the beginning of the corona crisis suddenly a lot of companies had applied for short-term employment, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually takes up to three weeks.
“We didn’t have that much time at this hot time.
We will take a closer look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be some more.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Signs of abuse often come from affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in autumn.
Will there be more insolvencies than last year?
The assessments are divergent, but we are preparing for the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the processing of applications for bankruptcy fees."
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden Dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved by the district drivers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced on PNN request.
The young people then left the park.
On Saturday night, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by district drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks.
In the parks of the foundation, there are accumulations in which the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 bypass regulation are not observed.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona ordinance, the parks are closed at nightfall.
Camping in the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more rubbish and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have meanwhile reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party in the night to Sunday.
The event was dissolved by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after corona outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were left in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young interns in tourism companies, but at least one holiday visitor has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are there and there cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the tourism association Wolfgangsee, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some of the guests have also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, around a third of the guests are Germans.
On Friday, the first infections became public.
The head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended on Saturday the behavior of the interns who had celebrated in several venues and could have infected themselves there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15th were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort Ischgl in Tyrol, which in the early stages of the pandemic was a center of corona spread throughout Europe.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main areas of concern for new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
The Red Devils secured third place on the last day of the Premier League with a 2-0 (0-0) success against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea was still passing by and also qualified as fourth for the premier class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United took the lead in a penalty shot by Bruno Fernandes (71 minutes).
After a red card for Leicester City in the follow-up time, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored.
Chelsea, Bayern's opponent in the Champions League final, defeated the Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2-0, thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who with a meager 1-1 (1-0) at Crystal Palace still drove past the Wolves and finished sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for himself, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United for the preservation of the class.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84) immediately offset Andrei Jarmolenko (85).
The 1-1 (0-0) was enough, however, because Watford lost with 2:3 (1-3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, descends after five first league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
In the end, one point was missing.
Liverpool, which has been standing as an English champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team barely missed the point record in English football.
Manchester City holds the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) shot the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
“It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club,” said scorer van Dijk after the match, “that should encourage us to defend the title.
It will be hard.”
In the end, the Premier League bosses will be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, soccer operations in England were interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, it was even discussed whether the remaining games should be cancelled prematurely or played on neutral ground.
Eventually, however, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrest and violence in protests against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming more and more intense.
In the night there were violent clashes.
The Israeli police took violent action in Jerusalem on the night of Sunday against participants in a demonstration against the right-wing Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu’s office on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s dealings with the corona crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew horns and called for Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site “ynet” reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including in front of the government’s private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a driving car on demonstrators on the roadside.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was easily injured in his throat.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Netanyahu has also been criticized for handling the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is held rushed loosenings and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has hit the country’s economy hard.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel recently rose to record levels.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A crash on Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen claimed nine light injuries.
A driver was traveling with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police said: "Sometimes she was slowing down because she wanted to turn off."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her must have seen this too late.
He squeezed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a nearby hospital.
North Korea shuts off border city after Corona suspicion
So far, North Korea has seen its own measures to fight off the coronavirus as a "shining success".
Now, for the first time, the country reports a suspected case.
Because of a first official corona case in the country, North Korea has completely shut off a big city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, “the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country,” state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency has been imposed.
The Communist leadership proclaimed the highest level of alarm.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the isolated country.
North Korea had not yet registered a single infection and described its defense measures as a "shining success".
The data was questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in an “outlier” who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
Three years ago, he resigned to South Korea and has now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation of the crossing of the border within the four-kilometre-wide and mostly still-mined military buffer zone from South Korea.
South Korea’s military, however, admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing to North Korea as high, according to the national news agency Yonhap.
Studies have been conducted on some people.
North Korea, according to its own statements, on Saturday called for an emergency meeting of the workers’ party’s political office, chaired by leader Kim Jong Un.
“The dangerous situation in Kaesong could cause a deadly and destructive catastrophe.”
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure, “to completely block Kaesong and to isolate every district and the region from others,” it added.
The affected person and all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with her were placed in quarantine.
The central military commission of the party should therefore investigate the "outlier case" as well as the behavior of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
Kaesong is estimated to have about 300,000 people.
Tension ahead of Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still to be discussed before a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale downtown development project East," it says more casually in the middle part of the urban press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
In particular, however, the appreciation of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majority for this is scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on the presence even rejecting.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed from the citizenry and then from the administration and the municipal council, now after almost ten years of preparation not to fail now, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unthinkable", "speculation", "voice-raising" and "conscious false statements".
“Everyone thinks they know better,” says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim Citizens’ List for a year.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit came the city cheaper, the Technical City Hall was contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of which Klein is convinced, to refurbish for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently from what is predicted in the city hall and on the part of the proponents of the economy.
To design the city by his own strength and not by an investor: that is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group presented an alternative concept, which also rejects the project.
It also essentially provides for the refurbishment of the Technical Town Hall, the openness of the castle mountain, the renting of the former valley for administrative areas and a more small-scale downtown refurbishment ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from health noise caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the German transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen, because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and therefore noise by neglecting regular bus traffic with thinned cycles and by little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The city council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the climate protection pact of the state of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the urban daycare facilities and the application for inclusion in the Smart City funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but must take Corona protection measures into account.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his premiere season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now in place.
For Zimmermann, the main goal was to get to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from starting his first service ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old long-distance racer made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season,” says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go in the corners differently.
But it really was a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sports, the Dutchman was able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges as well,” says Zimmermann.
“Steijn and I understand each other brilliantly and we have made tremendous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring.
Exactly there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also take its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 supercars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the route.
In 2015 he was the last guest in the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I didn't have to get used to the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast."
How fast Zimmermann really is, that turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams are playing poker a bit in the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring.
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a crowded calendar.
There will be seven races by the beginning of November.
Current status is that no spectators will be admitted – but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take part in the GT-Lenkrad.
British Minister of Transport of Quarantine Decision Coldly Caught
The British government’s decision to quarantin Spain vacationers for two weeks after their return has caught the country’s transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home on Saturday decided the measure.
Due to the corona numbers rising again in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine requirements.
The new rule will apply today, Sunday, so Shapps will have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are just on holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and has not been introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is needed in Austria.
“Numerous ministers should have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine for holidaymakers will be imposed on Spain,” Labour MP Diane Abbot said.
“But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapp.”
Nearly a month after the end of the Corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the severe curfew, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the UK’s favorite holiday destinations.
The British government currently advises against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, with the exception of the Canaries and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Naval Day: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the navy in his country that the warships will be equipped with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons, which are unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
According to the agency Interfax, the Ministry of Defence also informed about successful tests of the hypersonic rocket zirconium built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the sound speed of about 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo is still being built
It was also built on the atomic underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned seed drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also sailed on a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country in the world.
Russia has a coastal area as big as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has reliably protected Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces began the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There was also ammunition fired.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" Reaches Texas: Corona Help Difficult
Washington - This season's first hurricane across the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center told the U.S. Climate Agency NOAA in the night on Sunday (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Texas-based corona pandemic is making the work of the helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuators called for caution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Looking at the hurricane in Texas, he added, “This challenge is complicated and will be exacerbated considering it sweeps through an area that is the most heavily affected area of the state by Covid-19.”
According to Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the corona pandemic.
Abbott called on people who had to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices “that we have become accustomed to,” such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone stays away.
Hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, in emergency shelters on Corona should be tested.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning revoked
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, Hanna was hit on land on the island of Padre Island, just off the coast of Texas.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the lowest level one hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning had been issued and later revoked.
Authorities expected a weakening as “Hanna” moved further inland and headed towards the northeast of Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, hurricane “Douglas” was heading towards Hawaii at wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the hurricane center expected it to weaken further.
According to the prediction, it is said to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year, following a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes can be expected, of which up to six very strong hurricanes could become, the authority said.
On average, there are six hurricanes over the Atlantic each year, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, that of an under-average even at ten percent, it said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter that his government is closely watching the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals cancelled: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolos Filip Djuric has two goals.
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals cancelled: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a black evening in the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of unsuccessful goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR gone so hard against a team,” commented the “Corriere dello Sport”.
Host Naples had gone through a goal of defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuric initially cheered the balance.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took back the hit because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuric shot the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also withdrawn from the referee team, according to the VAR.
In the follow-up season, Allan made the 2-0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
“The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology creates records,” writes the “Gazzetta dello Sport”.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot preparation phase for the Champions League started with a setback for DoubleSieger FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, has to think about how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who is behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich the third most minute of operation, suffered a band injury at the left root and threatens to be missing in decisive king-class duels.
In Munich’s bad weather, the right-wing defender broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A match in the eighth final against Chelsea on 8 August is likely to be difficult, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting on 12 August in Lisbon.
The Bayern do not want to be stopped by the misfortune from training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to show his winning champions in the ideally following 28 days until the king class final on August 23.
"We have mastered the duties with championship and trophy just excellently.
Now we need to create something special,” Flick said.
Until the Munich can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, but first the eighth-final duty against Chelsea.
After the 3-0 in the final before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not again become a Bavarian nightmare like in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and refuel trust with a good game,” Flick said.
A match test is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a one-time August.
He welcomed 31 players at Säbener Straße, including the new players for edel-shopping Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues for the first time after his change from Manchester City.
“Leroy, like all the new ones, fits in well,” Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer only train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, the team is now trained in team strength for the Londoners, which are in contrast to the flick ensemble in the playing rhythm.
After that, the Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals are Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon “is not quite that easy,” stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday onwards.
The World Cup record shooter Klose and Flick know about many common tournament preparations, which is particularly important in the 0-to-100 match.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The “focus on winning” is an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the achievements, everyone was there, including the migrant-willing Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the premier class season is not secured.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to select its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All American races were cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the so far ten confirmed Grand Prix, three additional race tracks were added during the week.
The race is scheduled to take place in October at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimao, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Cup points on the traditional Italian race track in Imola.
According to the current status, the race calendar 2020 comprises 13 runs.
“We are pleased to continue making great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
A total of 15 to 18 races will be completed in this exceptional season in the premier class of motorsport.
Formula 1 is set to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, performances could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require races on three continents
However, the Formula 1 regulations require at least races on three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there is to be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "extraordinary circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the incipient corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection is criticized in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being back with them next season,” Carey said.
The cancellation of the Americas race was criticized in Brazil: "The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in Sao Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the area of Sao Paulo is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not to drive to Brazil would also not justify rejection.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: An Evil Look at Donald Trump Goes Around the World
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s well-known Latenight show via video and revealed in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Klimaatkivistin Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show.
Among other things, she talked about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenage girl also spoke about her famous “evil look” when she met with Donald Trump.
Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been drawing attention to her tireless commitment to the Fridays For Future movement.
Now, in a well-known Latenight show, she spoke about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at last year’s UN climate summit.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far people go to focus away from the climate crisis,” she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children goes to the streets,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock or even try to silence her on social media find her “funny” because she sees the reactions “as they have no other answer.”
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she threw a bitter-evil look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN Climate Summit in New York, for which she sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive view was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip created a GIF, i.e. an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the U.S. president at the moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the prompt answer and disappeared briefly laughing from the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe on par with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile still has the best chances of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional contributed three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona, including two transformed penalties in the follow-up periods of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from the table fourth two season games before the end now has 34 season goals on his account - just as many scored Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the past Bundesliga season.
In Italy Cristiano Ronaldo with so far 30 goals, the Portuguese superstar met with the leader in the evening still Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult supporter: the co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in sleep at the age of 73, family members said Saturday in an official statement that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton recognized Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a “monumental loss” for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now long-standing legendary band in London in 1967, until today his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all the profits of the group to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Mental problems also played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
A social descent followed.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street at times, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
From an early age, he was passionate about American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar handles.
At the age of 15, the teenager started playing professional guitar and five years later got the chance to be on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 together with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green earned the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green did not cope with the media buzz, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that has happened to me in life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he restarted in 1996 with a group of befriended musicians.
The British Daily Telegraph spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
