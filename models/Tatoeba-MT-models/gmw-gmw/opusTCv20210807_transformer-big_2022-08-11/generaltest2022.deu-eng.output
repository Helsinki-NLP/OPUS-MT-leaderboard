The goods cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm a major client of PRS_ORG, so it's not a problem for me.
All you need is a number or instructions that I should attach to the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the PRS_ORG a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs $179.
Honestly, I find that very annoying.
Do I need to cancel the order and reorder for the better price or is there another way of crediting?
In principle, I also think that children should not have to assume a parental role for their little siblings.
However, I think it is also good for big siblings to take care of the little ones in moderation.
Let’s take a look, let’s help, let’s bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as you can be a child, there is no problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it’s OK for him, that’s good.
You can determine for yourself whether this is right for your children.
It is not that he should wrap K2 and accompany for hours when falling asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is the statement of the psychologist.
Because if something really happened like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course your discretion ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again.
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the whole plot but I don’t want to think of the title partout anymore maybe someone knows here...
The story was about fear and treating it.
At the beginning of the story, a pet care man commits suicide by pouring himself over with food and going to his predatory cats enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation at his therapist, runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who is also afraid (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is more suicide and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously asked to go to the site of the suicide and document the photos on the internet before each suicide.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist operates a kind of underground therapy group where the patient is transplanted a chip that suppresses a center of anxiety in the brain and ultimately the patients face their fear in the most extreme way.
(One woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately dies)
This fear is called “the fight” in the book.
In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
That’s the rough plot I’m pretty sure the book was written in the original by a French author.
If anyone knows this or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi.
I need to contact my husband first.
But it can take time.
What steps do I have to take afterwards?
Is it also possible to remit the price difference?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumbnail
Child, four years old, has over the entire length wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outside).
I tried to pull him with a tweezer.
Very hard to grasp.
It didn't work and hurt.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
Tomorrow we go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family.
Through the combination of digital decoder and sound module on a printed circuit board we reach dimensions of only 30mm x15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with an 11x15mm "sugar cube" loudspeaker in addition to sound capsule kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder.
It masters the data format DCC as well as Motorola, Selectrix and M4.
In DCC format, 14 to 128 driving stages are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus, the decoders log on fully automatically to a suitable digital center.
It masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom, the CV values on the main track can be read with suitable centrals.
For centers that can only program the CVs of 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola users benefit from up to 28 driving stages at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions.
A built-in programming mode also makes reprogramming possible with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows automatic logging at mfx-compatible centers.
The LokSound 5 decoder detects the Märklin brake tracks as well as ZIMO HLU brake commands or the Lenz ABC system.
Braking with DCC brake modules or with DC voltage is also possible.
In addition, it also stops at a Selectrix brake diode.
An ABC automatic pendulum train allows automatic commuting between two stations.
The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue direct and alternating current paths.

Omikron: Johnson wants to boost vaccination
More and more Omikron cases are getting politics and science in the UK.
By the New Year, all qualifying adults in England will receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make progress on corona boosting vaccinations even faster than previously envisaged in the face of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his compatriots.
So far, the target date has been at the end of January.
The UK government will provide additional support to speed up vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
Given the Omikron variant, one faces an emergency, which is why vaccination protection urgently needs to be strengthened, Johnson said.
The good news is that the level of protection can be increased again with a third dose of vaccination.
"Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was a whopping 65 percent increase. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I'm in favor of everyone introducing themselves to pronouns
I sent off an application.
Today, the invitation came to a conversation via email.
I want to reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not a "Peter", but a slightly more complicated name.
I googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it’s either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the email.
Can someone please help me?
** I'm a foreigner and I don't want to kick an official on my feet.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves to pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them.
The only thing I bought today is not
Obviously, the chair had an unseen shortage on sale.
How else can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months?
First tried on the PRS_ORG.
This has been working since ca.
14 days no more.
That’s why I always bought the last books through the website and then read them on the PRS_ORG.
I bought 6'PRS_ORG' and wanted to buy 8's.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I would like you to add 2 chairs to the order and charge me that.
[CW] Feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I’m going to write a little bit about domestic violence here.
I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come more often in contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
One issue that really gnaws at me and unfortunately is far too common is that many victims cannot be helped or think we could not help them.
I know we can’t do everything and it’s not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in private conversations with the perpetrator, far out of sight and hearing, I can’t reach everyone.
I don’t know what the reason is, maybe it’s fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of ripping the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to the tears, is all worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don’t just have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But that never makes it easier.
Please, always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's up with "League of Legends"?
Lots of fantasy, lots of complicated names, a stunning look: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently launched on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby debacle of the MHP giants Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on youngster Johannes Patrick was reliant.
Nothing more: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Prior to the game, Ludwigsburg coach John Patrick had said with a review of the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our belly."
After the game, however, it did not lie down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the basketball league.
Even more so than the naked result disappointed the way of the performance.
Let’s mention a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: the three-person ratio was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young Johannes Patrick) in a whopping 31 attempts – still questions?
John Patrick said: “We weren’t concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife and didn’t implement what we trained.”
To move the ball.
His reaction to Sebastian Gleim was quite different: "To win a horny game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the lucky coach.
“It felt like 10,000 people.”
Only 750 visitors were admitted to the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their expense.
Not least because of BBL topscorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and steered the match of his team.
“The best gamemaker I’ve ever trained,” Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team even the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15), the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already lost 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there isn’t much time left to wrestle.
Already on Wednesday (19 o'clock) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have a different email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I reported a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have been legally informed again and have therefore contacted them again.
We originally contacted six months ago.
Max Raabe is 59
He is able to inspire his audience with reinterpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently he is on his way with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it doesn't turn out to be anything.
The planned concert was moved to May 2022 - "by official instruction" to curb the corona virus.
Other of his performances planned during the Advent season also have to fail, as the singer’s website, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de) say.
From January onwards, the artists want to make up for their already shifted dates in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.
He studied opera singing in Berlin, and in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established itself with its repertoire of Schlagern and Chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He has been awarded many awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He made it out of the niche into the mainstream.
Always dressed elegantly, the blond hair strictly combed back and thoughtful of etiquette, Max Raabe is indispensable from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, good luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

German Federal Minister for Construction, Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new home
The new Federal Minister for Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing groups, as was demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
“With an expropriation not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure,” said Geywitz in an interview with the “Tagesspiegel” (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
By the way, a colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is the best protection against a monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of the SPD, the Greens and the Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation did not relax, Geywitz did not exclude discussions with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement envisages a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tense housing markets and the expansion of the rental level.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.

At least 100 killed by tornadoes in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have been pulled through the United States.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 deaths.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
During the night on Saturday, several tornadoes in the United States caused serious devastation and possibly claimed up to a hundred deaths.
The storms leave a devastation of about 320 kilometers, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the tornado was roasted, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He expects up to a hundred deaths in Kentucky alone, with official figures rising every hour.
Hi, I just saw that she's sold out.
That's a shame.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely taken out of the range?
Is it possible to order this showcase in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order !
I understand that, only can I order the blanket now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask if this was coming or being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination premiums and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject the proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and offer their employees money premiums for the vaccination.
Thus, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls – following the German model – should also increase the readiness for corona vaccinations.
He switched to a company he blasphemed about.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Wait and drink tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn’t stitch himself in his old place and was looking for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't like you at the time: well, no matter.
He didn’t like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please record the cancellation.
This will be legally relevant.

Help with your first campaign
Boron to size!
I am currently leading the Over the Greifenpass adventure for a group of 4 friends and want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We play DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts conceived and now I am about to write the entry-level adventure and stumble on my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes should bring a cart of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near Lake Thuran.
This is where the further action should develop.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins are to lure the heroes into ambush.
I want to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: persuade, act, threat, detect the danger early, whatever comes to mind of the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 armed with spears, 6 with bows and sabers
If not noticed, the goblins lurk on the hero in a hollow path and flank me armed with three left and right arches, while two stop the vehicle with spears.
If it comes to battle and the heroes are subject, I have two solutions.
The heroes are all found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village shrine, a half-eleven.
The cart is gone, of course.
If a defeat is inevitable, this half-eleven intervenes with two of his servants and comes to the aid of the hero in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How do you think Deus ex Machina of Solution 2 is appropriate?
Is the Encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a crucial role later, so it is not just gun food.
EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will be sure to listen to many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my narrative.
I disassembled the lamp again.
And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd still like to send them back.
If you can then leave the flashbacks to come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to the PRS_ORG.

I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the season the quality on the German sky has decreased more and more, so I want to make a little air with this post.
First of all, today in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was cancelled in order to start F1 pre-reporting on time.
Due to the delayed start and the start accident, the schedule was far behind schedule, but you could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!)
Apparently, however, for legal reasons, F1 takes precedence and therefore everything else has to be limited, so that Sky DE probably had no choice here.
It’s stupid, especially since Sky UK has finished the race.
Nevertheless, a little praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was once again a lack of knowledge in the F1 with the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tyres under a red flag.
Although this situation already existed in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that Verstappen was only allowed to change the tyres when there were corresponding radio messages on the subject to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this option.
I think you should know such basic rules simply by commenting on F1 on a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first guess, which is now possible or prescribed by the rules, both simply have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally speaking, the articulated commentary style of Roos does not like it, but admits that it is a matter of taste.
But I really like Heiko Water from RTL better.
In addition, there are constant silliness, which both simply make it look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the (also unsuspecting) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
The latter, in particular, brings a lot of uneasiness to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Last but not least, the advertising simply prevails at Sky, in the expiration round Sky is the only channel that goes into the advertising, as you can listen to at F1TV since only the German soundtrack without comment has to get through right after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do.
Also, these two channels advertise less in training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not let me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language channel to transmit the F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job in the four races, apart from the advertising, that they are still allowed to transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable transmitter.
I would be interested in your opinion.

Hello, I have an item that should be delivered last week and that is still not delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing so far.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she never responded.
Hi, I ordered two of them on 12.12.19.
One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the stool).
I'm asking for support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system via air lifters.
This series is available in 3 variants.
Take a look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the benefits in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with it.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outputs are suitable so that you can connect several outflows.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, but depending on the model fan pump are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, e.g. with an air curtain (find in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, mussel or something like that.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected by means of an air hose 4/6 mm to an outflower or the like... and it can start.
The fan pump should be the same or higher than the water level and be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent once water running backwards running the water out of the basin through the pump...
If the fan pump is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy
Even if we specify the processing time here in ebay with 3 days, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up here daily.
Everything goes well on the way, it goes very fast.
We just want to prevent a little so that no one is upset just because it once took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in freight forwarding...of course, no corona stops here.
Please do not rate badly, just because the delivery is delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, you like to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment...they are fucking hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don’t be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope there will be better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?

Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the missile system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
Launch and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly chosen astronauts back in.
"Welcome back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue room suit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers gradually climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on the road for 10 minutes and 13 seconds, reaching an altitude of 107 kilometers.
74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), named after Blue Origin's rocket system, and 50-year-old TV presenter Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, and his son Lane Bes.
How much they paid each time for their ticket, Blue Origin did not tell.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled her father's mission after the short flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself.
She just flew along, the 74-year-old said with a laugh.
Michael Strahan was also very enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers altitude
The missile system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the earth, at times with zero gravity, before the reusable object, decelerated by large parachutes, landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the earth as a boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned all-time trip from Blue Origin: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former U.S. pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
The second in October was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became world famous with his role as Captain Kirk in Star Trek, as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy boss of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of pushing space tourism business largely without scientific research interests for the good of humanity and without regard for the climate.
At the touch of a button, you can choose whether to permanently light up your "Smart Stone" in one color or play through its entire color repertoire.
Set to color change, the lightstone retains a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative shade.
The solid design of the Smart Stone lamp proves itself outdoors all year round.
In snowy surroundings, their light is even particularly good – only a shorter illumination time can be expected as soon as the days are shorter.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry
I am currently studying biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject in itself quite exciting and I am not bothered in the laboratory (already have the inorganic chemistry internship behind me).
Of course, I was already informed about career prospects before my studies, but also thought about the time that I would definitely want to study until my doctorate.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially my career prospects.
On the one hand (study check etc) you always hear great job opportunities and the job is totally wanted, on the other hand you hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
So I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What training did you do?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your comments!
I am currently really insecure and may be considering canceling my studies in 2022 and making an apprenticeship as a specialist in computer science.
If you have any experience, you also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holiday weekends
This topic came up with me last week.
I had to take my long weekend to relax.
That's why just now a post on it.
Not only before big holidays, like the Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, there are also before holidays plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called the Assumption in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and companies make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So there was a long 4-day weekend in the house last week.
So what happened last week?
Stress everywhere.
Lots of e-mails that absolutely had to go out before the driveway, order here, everything *imperatively* before the long weekend.
Because... yes because?
Because next week sounds like so much time and that shouldn’t be?
Or because people really want to do as much in a shorter week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also greatly annoyed.
What does this self-sacrifice mean for holidays?
Why do we have holidays if we can’t afford them properly?
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all quite self-sufficient.
The question is, are we the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Do you know that in the North?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian home - but has no presents at all.
"The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the party by baking and making cookies with her son.
“I love that,” Catterfeld said.
Until the days of contemplation, however, she still has a lot to do: “For the first time I don’t have any gifts yet, I have to get started now.”
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth operation of the mousers and plumage rebuilding.
NEKTON-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 mcg of biotin/kg.
NEKTON Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of plumage damage occurring in bird farming is solely due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage is made of protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect feather dress.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Much of the animal loss that occurs during the mouse is due to lack of or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedingstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be given during the use of NEKTON-Bio.
NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can easily be administered via drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it
Unfortunately still not working
DDR-Handarbeitsmodell Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the locomotive was in use in Silesia and Central Germany, the very rare locomotive probably originates from the conversion proposal of the model railway ME issue 11/1968, used with traces of play and defects see photos, function well, the E 95 series is a heavy goods train electric locomotive of the German railway company where the German railway company
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Halle (Saale) and we are operationally refurbished
In 1924, the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft commissioned the AEG to submit proposals for an electric locomotive that could transport 2,200-ton coal trains and 530-ton passenger trains at 45 km/h on this route.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, via the delivery as a 1'Co+Co1' locomotive with Act bearing drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the DRG determined the Siemens shocker plants with the electric part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, six locomotives were delivered with operating numbers E 95 01-06.
All survived the Second World War and then found themselves on the territory of the later GDR.
In 1946, the locomotives arrived in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In the Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk Dessau, the reworkability of all six locomotives was established.
[4] As the re-electrification of the Central German network resulted in an increasing demand for locomotives for heavy goods train service, the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were reworked in 1959, with the other machines serving as spare parts dispensers.
First, the E 04, E 44 and E 94, which are present in larger quantities, were preferably constructed.
Only when it was foreseeable in the E 94 that the work-up number could not be increased further, the E 95 moved into the focus of the work-up.
[4]First, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig-Wahren railway plant.
They came to the railway plant Halle P in 1960.
They were mostly used in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
Problematic was the complicated control of the locomotives with increasing age.
It has often happened that shooters stick to shifts.
Then the Beimann with a hammer and a wooden wedge had to release the shooter during the ride.
Damage to the driving engines occurred more often and led to months of failures in the locomotive.
[5] Since there were enough new locomotives at the end of the 1960s and a significant expansion of electric operation was not planned at the time, the Reichsbahn was able to renounce old locomotives and most of the splinter types, so that the E 95 was put out of service.
In addition, the Deutsche Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electric locomotives only for one man, which would have resulted in a problem in train operation due to the aforementioned difficulties with the machines and the visibility of the driver's cab.
[5] After the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were discontinued in mid-1969, they were the last to follow the E 95 01, which ceased service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new designation 255 001 was therefore never used.
All locomotives were dismantled except for the E 95 02.
The E 95 02 was installed as a replacement for the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a switch heating system on the main station Halle.
It took some time before those in charge of the Reichsbahn could be convinced that the E 95 was worthwhile as a museum locomotive.
In 1979, the first external reworking of the locomotive began with the aim of being able to present it to a vehicle show at RAW Dessau.
[5] Since then, it has belonged to the Verkehrsmuseum Dresden as an inoperable museum locomotive.
In 1986, the internal completion of the locomotive took place.
In the DB Museum Halle (Saale) the locomotive is looked after museums.
Since 1995, employees of the traditional community Bw Halle P have been working on the operational refurbishment of the locomotive.
In April 2015, the locomotive was presented for the first time at an exhibition in Museums-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior paintwork, with the transformers being checked and five driving motors being operational.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Silesian mountain railway and the branching side tracks, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945, the machines were relocated to Leipzig as a central German network.
The main area of operation was Silesia.
Handmade model H0 in OVP, function well, optical rework on the locomotive is necessary, dusted, with play tracks, cellar smell !!!, very rare handmade model, very small edition - possibly the kit also comes from the small series company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packaging may have labels and storage marks.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet.. unfortunately these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately defectively produced.
The middle bar does not fit into the provided holder.
So I get new ones.
When will they be sent off?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right of the shape, they were only too narrow
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
With me they are not flat
Could I get these sent?
Hello, should I explain the problem again?
Home fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage occurred in the six-digit euro area, police said on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjoining residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not known at first, but the police did not assume that it was deliberately set on fire.
Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
But it will come much later
And I have to pay shipping costs again
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
On the social network "LinkedIn" published a photo of his first vaccination in early 2021
Biontech chief U’ur’ahin had not yet publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend had moved him to do so, said Ahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, U?ur?ahin, has published a photo showing how to get a vaccine against the coronavirus.
There was false information on social media that I wasn’t vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine,” wrote aahin on Friday in a post on the network “LinkedIn”.
"For several months now, friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me on which I am vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has refused to do so because the communication should not be about himself.
But a call last week changed his mind: “I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently struggling for his life.
He fights a severe Covid-19 disease and has been hanging on a ventilation device for three weeks.
"The school friend and his family are not vaccinated," he wrote.
He did not ask for the reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle circulates, in which U’ur’ahin says he’s not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed to get the vaccine myself by law," said Ahin at the time.
There is a priority in Germany when it comes to vaccination.
In the meantime, the prioritization has long been cancelled - and the biontech boss has been vaccinated three times, according to his own data.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without electricity
In several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went off on Friday evening: no more electricity and in many cases probably no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation.
After a fire with serious damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia have had to live for about 24 hours without electricity.
As a result of the fire, the lights went off on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several municipalities.
The utility Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power units had been in operation until the large-scale disruption could finally be completely fixed in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered shelters in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The caregiver thanked the affected ones for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant limitations.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Division, in a communication on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz-Monteure could at first only temporarily put some lines back into operation, he explained.
According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire.
Electricity flows again
According to Westnetz, the fire that erupted around 7.15 p.m. on Friday severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear system in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
Expensive cleaning and repair work is required.
At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually added from 9.30 p.m.
Since 11.15 p.m., the last person affected by the outage also had electricity.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in use.
The authorities had also called for neighbourhood assistance after the construction of an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is now important that citizens take care of elderly or single people in their neighbourhood and communicate with the local fire department stores when help is needed," Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) said after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the main focus was on the residents of retirement homes.
In addition, according to authorities, temporary care facilities have been set up in schools for those people who were unable to provide themselves or who need electricity-dependent medical devices or are dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the blanket is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy them from you and pay in euros?
It is the day blanket PRS_ORG in blue-green.
I hope you have a nice day too and please stay healthy.
But I can't mount the undercarriage on the table top.
It's Custom 'NAME'.
There are 3 versions of this.
We wanted those with table tops diameter of "NUMBER"
we got 155cm diameter.
Today my PRS_ORG arrived, but I can’t push it together and shorten it.
Can you help me?
Otherwise I would have to send it back, otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would like to receive a feedback
Yes, that's really easier!
Then let's do it like this!
will you send me the return note by e-mail?
The repair is now completed.
I tried this before the chat.
However, I had not restarted the E-PRS_ORG before the purchase.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low credit almost outrageous.
We do not agree with this
Nordic combination: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid are on the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo once again had to beat the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started the trail with a great lead after ski jumping.
Returns of the order number "NUMBER"
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes we made both s new and use the version 4.5...
You may have heard of problems many times.
I bought a book directly with my PRS_ORG, it seems to be on it too.
Sobal I want to open it comes the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be faulty you report to customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a PRS_ORG epub file.
Can you help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in between too!
To make the paint application even and clean, you should clean the components with some soapy water of dust, grease and fingerprints, rinse and dry with clear water.
Before putting the brush on the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first line on the component
Drag the brush evenly next to the stroke.
A slight overlap of the paint layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid swiping back and forth quickly with the brush.
This creates unrealistic surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could shine through later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metallic garlands can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you install them.
The models achieve their original appearance through the decals or decals.
From sovereign signs on aircraft to ship names to trims and license plates for car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Apply the decals in the correct order as long as the components are still easy to reach.
An aircraft cockpit can be glued or more easily before it is installed in the fuselage.
Even more important than the right tool like scissors, tweezers and toothpick are when gluing time, patience and a calm hand.
Cut out each required decal individually and set it up for you.
Decals are also called water slides, because you briefly moisten their back with water until the carrier paper becomes dark through the wet.
Then slide the picture only a small piece of paper and place the piece on the appropriate spot on the model (which you have also moistened before).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the backing paper away at the side.
Attention: Always check that the image is correct before pushing it completely off the paper so that it doesn’t stick, wrinkle or even tear on the finger.
Suction off excess water with a household towel.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look for something else then I stop reading the book and have to log out and sign up and reload the book and look for the place to where I have read it.
I already communicated with you on Saturday.
Do I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages
Thank you very much!
I will buy somewhere else once the money is back.
Can I get it back without any problems?
Fertility treatment at PKV / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello together,
we were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly turns across.
In the series:
We had applied for the fertility course extension in advance at the PKV and received the promise of 3 attempts.
The experiments were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and childbirth and was settled with the PKV.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet calculate them with the PKV.
We once again applied for the cost transfer from the PKV and were again granted 3 further attempts.
After a few more attempts (we did more attempts than we promised, logically the most expensive with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and got the nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The reason: With the pregnancy / childbirth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire.
The second child’s wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, however, "the insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts will be refunded) or us (it is 5 attempts to refund)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us in the commitments that with one birth the further attempts will expire?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you so much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back
All right.
We won't order anything from them anymore.
When they add up the sales of me and my friend NAME (same address), they have obviously lost good customer.
You are welcome to pass it on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday the colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now tell me that I have to return the thing.
I can't help but that the dresser arrives at me completely disturbed.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
It is clear that the repayment has been initiated and I have still not received a repayment by .PRS_ORG
You can inform your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered several furniture for our apartment through his account.
We're not going to do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
An office chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, you can’t sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to purchase another type of packaging.
I will be able to dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in this way.
Good day, I have a question about your series of 'PRS_ORG'
These products are advertised with additional stools to be purchased, but unfortunately we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget movie is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget movie** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
On the net you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting people in this category?
What's this all about?
And what you might not like at all?
I am a very good customer of you, have already furnished 2 apartments complete with your furniture.
I wanted to ask for the best price for the grey leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now reliable?
Thank you.
With kind regards
If there is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position... I will give up again soon because it just does not work here.
Hello!
“Half victory” against Belarus incurs high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a “half victory” in conflict with the Belarusian regime.
But the costs are very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at Belarus' border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelische Pressedienst (epd).
The EU has not solved the confrontation sustainably, the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) explained.
This state of stagnation - Belarus is not giving in very little, but the EU feels like a winner - is probably going on for a while.
Dealing with people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said.
There is an “increasing normalization of pushbacks” by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole is not determined to turn against it, this is at the expense of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens cohesion in the Union.
“It does not seem to be able to prevail if a member state sets itself in the head to do its thing,” as currently Poland, which does not even allow the EU border agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU pays another price for its policy on the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to Poland’s border guards, migrants have again tried to get to Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and returned to the border, a spokeswoman for the authority said on Sunday.
Polish officials were stoned by the migrants in the incident near the village of Czeremsza.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
On Friday, a group of 28 migrants overcame the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months or tried.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko as ruler in Minsk of enticing them with the prospect of entering the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania closed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travelled to people’s countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU response is the pressure on the airlines, Bossong said.
“The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and has demonstrated its determination to operate with harsh bandages and extraterritorial sanctions.”
Minsk must also take into account domestic costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not prepared to have the security apparatus regularly drag thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule breaks during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken it irregularly.
A second objection was filed against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the last lap in the Mercedes and had raced to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I'll check it out.
I'll talk to the bank and get back to you.
Thanks for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the name given to the Europa-Park stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park reports, members and permanent card holders of the Sport-Club from Breisgau as well as members of the fan community were allowed to visit the Europa-Park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The rollercoaster trains shone through the jerseys red and white that day.
Fuchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-and-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop.”
Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesligist and the amusement park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg fan day in the Europa-Park, it was once again clear how well the partnership fits.
Seeing radiant fans having fun together in the roller coaster confirms this,” says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it “Number” and not “Originally” $1699?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home"
As part of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord", author Judith Hermann read in the sold-out Blue Note from her current novel "Home" on Friday and also acted as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the nightly sounds at her front door.
Yesterday I placed the contact form to return an item, but I did not receive an email confirmation or the like.
My question is whether my request has been received.
It doesn’t have everyone’s time for your dumb chat and incorrectly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake that you fix and not all of our budget.
Get in touch with Ms. "NAME".
I can't chat with them every day.
Yesterday we had chatted and agreed that I or Ms. 'NAME' would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order for the 'PRS_ORG' bedside table and a return label.
This email has not been sent yet.
The package wants to bring to PRS_ORG today.

But once you’re a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and science is just stuffing nonsense.
And thus you are a science enemy and not to continue to take seriously like Kollegah
In order to obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially designed aplanatically-achromatic lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass to the edge zone without practical sealing and color error.
Lupen are often labeled with magnification indications.
However, these data only apply to exactly defined conditions that rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make the most of your magnifying glass, we ask you to follow the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the packaging).
Light reflections are created on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, i.e. also in the case of snap-in loops.
These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflective coating.
When the optimal conditions of use are observed - magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying instructions for use (in German and English).

Sale of fir trees in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women choose the Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced so many curious situations in the fir sale.
Once, a man is said to have gone home without his partner, because they could not agree.
Every year he plants about 2,000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations.
That always makes Christmas a bit fun, he says.
What about the voucher?
Or am I gone as a customer?
After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
I will evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need to have discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating skewer.
So both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "turner", which doesn't sound so delicious by far.
Problems with fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have trouble building a stable wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit port and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent out 50 Mbit, except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connector sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also arrives.
However, the other DLan module, which sends out the Wifi, no longer arrives at the full 500, but the further I distance myself in the house with the module, the less arrives (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. spaces away from the other module).
As a result, the Internet is even slower than before with the new fiber optic connection on the first floor.
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses a new technology.
Although this was slightly better than the DLan, there were similarly large losses here.
Could someone explain to me why with fiber so much internet speed via the power line "is lost"?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely complicated to install LAN cables in the house.
I’m really desperate why I created an account here.
That is why I would like to receive an answer all the more.
When it is time to change your current account
Anyone who would have thought that the current accounts were at rest at first is mistaken.
While many banks have used autumn to have their customers confirm the charge increases of the past with all kinds of tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates continue to fall.
Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous for a long time with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered for the daily allowance.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only for customers of the Postbank Group division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily money accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request.
Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as at ING Germany.
The direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has reduced the allowances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
After all, more than 100 banks now have a allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the Internet portal Verivox.
Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres, which have even gotten right in the first instance before the Regional Court of Berlin against this regulation.
The banks are already discussing whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in the event that the upper authorities also declare the negative interest rates in principle inadmissible and many millions to bank customers have to be paid back.

Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
Their life is like a mountain and a valley.
Jennifer Aniston, 52, was voted the most influential woman of the year by The Hollywood Reporter.
For them, who made a fuss in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers takes care of their appearance.
After all, according to Aniston, treat yourself to a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the bag).
The fact that the hearts of the female and male fans still fly to her equally is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she’s just bad luck – and still looking for great love.
And removed the baby's wish from the list.
She was constantly asked when she was going to be a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
Hopefully, success and fame will make you happy.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Give Up
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell to Formula 1 was even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped his sweat off his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight tyre touch, Räikkönen had to drop off his Alfa Romeo at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport king class.
His wife, Minttu, and the two children also travelled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He scored 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole and came 103 times on the podium.
Friedrich gets 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-legged bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bob pilot.
“I’ve figured that out, I’ll have to score nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026,” said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the Winterberg races.
First on Saturday, he resisted Johannes Lochner’s attack by five hundredths, in which he drove from third to one.
Then he changed something about the material setting and drove out a bigger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he prevailed in front of the British Brad Hall.
The third place was won by the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also entered his 22nd win in series.
Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came fifth after second place this time before.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race.
“If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way,” Lochner said.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
Among the women, Laura Nolte won the third season in the two-seater bob on her home run.
After reaching only for fourth place the day before in the Monobob, she raced for World Cup victory on Sunday in the German triple victory with Deborah Levi.
Two-seater bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany’s fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
In addition to her Olympic qualifiers, she made the first podium this winter.
Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me it was supercool, first podium in the World Cup, I am super happy Mariama takes me.
I am super happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It is not only pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was annoyed by the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I already had the blanket in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I didn’t get it and therefore couldn’t redeem why I finally asked.
I had different problems with Corona last year and never had time for that.
And now he said he was gone, which upset me a lot.
Look at the chat it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order again as it is just reduced :)
Why is shipping only started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such long delivery time on your website
No only when I tap on it comes an extra field with the message
It was taken off by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today
I've also sent you pictures of the wrong would be delivered.
But we want the shelf module anyway, just a new undamaged
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear great girls and girls and women,
I have a few things I want to write and maybe one of them...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't scream or go to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is ill, has taken a 2nd degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because hand is in the dressing wg burning).
It’s cooled up and we’re currently seeing each other less (1-2x week) which makes me very upset with my needs for affection and love.
My dog kid just got stomachache, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cuddly blanket and relaxed a bit after I was there with the heat lamp and petting for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's just gone for a month.
We also have some housework that we share.
Cooking is a lot of work for me.
My PTSD is just quite well-adjusted, I am half well-treated and I can cope.
Not good, but I get along and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3pm I did a written test for which I did nothing and anatomy hours the day after tomorrow for which I should prepare at least a bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room.
So my week goes like this: only until the day after tomorrow, then it’s weekend.
But then the whole thing goes on?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the beginning of the holiday.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it continues forever.
I think I’m just so stressed out that I need these mental clues, because otherwise I’m packing that ned.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Do you feel the same way?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don’t have to work.
Truly infinitely grateful, I can’t put that into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs.
I think this has something to do with mental load of women and that's why I thought that I'm sure I'll find sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I got my order today unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table leg has imprint.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12.
For the rest, two times.
But it was not confirmed.
At school, I found that many religious teachers do not believe in God and that it is just another subject for them, such as math or geography.
It was always a bit strange to me, perhaps because I was raised as a Christian and I always believed in some way.
How do you feel about that?
You may also be able to talk about colleagues at work or at university with different attitudes.
Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it makes sense to separate.
There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would just be strange to have a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes you want to teach religion if you don’t believe it?
Culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?Write it in English.
It's been a long time, then I'd refrain from it.
All right, thanks.
I expect to receive feedback in good time by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support.
Please help
Hello dear people,
I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I think it was a film for young people.
In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
First, the modern (real world).
Secondly, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can’t describe it in more detail in the real world, there’s a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Curse of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to live for herself.
The transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
In the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that tells you anything, I am grateful for every response.
From week 1 onwards, our little girl slept only on her stomach.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than you think.
Make sure that everything around it is right, no cuddly animals, go in and watch more often, but no minutes of surveillance.
That makes you mad!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Achso and ours never had a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he is asleep.
Does it turn its head aside?
Can it stand up from the stomach?
Or is your face right in the mattress?
From this you can deduce if everything is okay.
We all grew up, too, and when my husband was born, it was like walking and putting the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
In addition, we are already "basic customer" with you and have already bought a lot of items
But why do you offer me only 20 euros?
Hi, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any feedback yet.
It’s about my closet that arrived yesterday (order number: ALPHANUMERIC-ID).
The right drawer does not fit into the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cupboard is not currently used.
To put it very clearly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know for myself, not everything can be kept.
I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It is simply that the politics of this broadcaster is now under all control.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then at the same time go on a big begging tour.
It has been said that you are an “independent” internet station.
Arno: “You don’t want to be a running liquor column.”
What are you doing now?
An 0815 advertising channel trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then there’s Marah’s Do’s & Don’ts.
That applies to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogman who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ashes at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms.
How do you like all this?
Great if you like it, I think it's horrible.
I ask for a back call, as my delivered wooden table has been delivered defectively.

Whether as a comforter for abdominal pain or just for cuddling – my little warmth friend can be used in a variety of ways.
Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry kernels can absorb heat very well and release it in doses.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even if they are not doing so well.
The cover cherry core cushion is suitable as a heat pad exclusively for the following application areas:
Before heating the pillow, check for untypical odor, stick or fire stains and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the inner pillow from the cover before heating!
Heat in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer's instructions!)
Directly after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
Then put the inner cushion back into the cover.
In the case of the first heating, a slight moisture formation can occur on the surface, but this disappears in repeated applications.
Be sure to follow the warming instructions given, as longer periods or higher energy performance can lead to damage (inflammation and burn risk!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, check that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions for use.
After the heated inner cushion is back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (maximum 43 °C) on your arm bend!
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bruising and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain sensations.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumour diseases, as well as pregnancy, please contact a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and loose cores leak, dispose of the product and loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during use to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and to the competent authority of the country in which the user is established.
The cover is removable and washable in the machine at 30°C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working out of the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it does not work under the third coach.
Jubilee in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top match, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed finish under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded through my power supply.
I bought it about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought power supply alone would be enough to operate.
Defective display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts despite the power supply plugged in.
I then removed the battery, but there is nothing going on here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop when it's running?
Anything else broke?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the PRS_ORG to the room.
How can I book this?
I am interested in the PRS_ORG chair.
I don’t know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack by Peak Design!
20 liters of capacity also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else you need on everyday objects, thanks to practical accesses in the individually configurable interior, remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment.
With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
With the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works in two ways: once conventionally via the lid flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, a well-thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
In the closing flap, there is a metal closure hook with matching anchor beams on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has come up with different "filling levels": there are 4 anchor bars, which are stably riveted, in which the closure hook can be hooked.
If the backpack is full of load, you just take the top bar, it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Valve closure and hooks are also magnetic.
Thus, the backpack can also be closed reliably without locking the hook.
The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid flap, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest drawback of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to crawl through the content!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack you can configure the interior individually (more below) and thus store both separately - and access them independently through the two lateral openings.
You can also pull the backpack in front of the body from the right side, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items stay securely in the left half of the backpack and do not get in between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with this.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is supposed to go to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I am in vain waiting for the email from your support.
Yesterday, I received an email confirming the
Contact on the part of the freight forwarder to pick up the wrongly delivered table announced.
So far I have not received a message.
I ask for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support employee, and I have never come further than to the promise that I will receive a confirmation email.
This is the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom .
It is important to know when the cupboard can be returned.
Keeping him like that is not an option for me.
It works.
Thank you very much for the help
Wishing you a nice evening
Hello, my order number is "NUMBER". When will the item be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I received a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me
If you extend the voucher to me, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not return it.
And that last year went differently than I expected, I couldn’t imagine and just couldn’t solve it in time and clarify it.
But I have the damage as a customer and I don’t accept that.
Roting brake discs are designed to meet the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking even in difficult conditions.
Roting brake discs are made of cast iron and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which is based on the characteristics of the original assembly with the balancing of the disc.
The tuned discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, with the cut-outs improving the cleaning of the brake discs and brake blocks.
Aesthetic features of our tuned discs underline the character of every car by their attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the west coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man on the southern fork of the American River discovered luminous chunks in the water.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called 'California Gold Rush' of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were laid out, tents opened, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country’s wealth.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for himself.
You’ll look for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to outperform your pioneer colleagues so as not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions at the same time, have to budget with your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, get additional actions, or turn rules in your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual play style with the help of fine adjustments.
Coloma takes place over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), over 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players will secretly select a location on the schedule where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers in the right locations.
If a site has the most pioneers, it gets a ban!
This deactivates one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Players then take alternate actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolver heroes.
When all the actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The awardee turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the awardee has moved five times, i.e. every location has once covered up and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If players have contributed enough guns and are superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they get lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final rating takes place.
The player with the most winning points wins!

"Why children are not tyrants" - ARD Mediathek
CW psychic violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary appeared on my Twitter timeline today, and I looked at it right away.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce educational debate.
The former patient and the rightful parent are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
We parents and other responsible persons must never, never, never! go for power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for his development and to make the framework for the child as large as it makes sense and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinated persons
The health ministers of the countries want to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide elimination of the test obligation for triple vaccinated persons.
"We countries need to quickly clarify whether and when the test obligation for three vaccinated persons can be waived," Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministerial Conference, told Bild am Sonntag.
The elimination of 2G plus for triple vaccinated persons is "not only medically meaningful, but also provides an additional vaccine incentive," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised that he will make a proposal to the Ministerial Conference on Health on Tuesday.
So I want to send the lamp back
What is the best way to do that?
Hello, I think the .PRS_ORG chair is very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can no longer make purchases via my PRS_ORG.
Display: Oops, an error occurred.
Purchasing is done via the PRS_ORG page on the computer.
I have updated account data.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is called *awareness*, meaning sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing noises/voices, less often to seeing images and most rarely to perceiving pain.
Relevant to this topic: C-sections are operations that go hand in hand with an increased rate of awareness, as you avoid a very deep anesthesia to protect the child.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anaesthetic interview.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, but ** u/Nitemarex ** by definition did not have any.
I misread your comment.
The chair is defective.
The $20 will not help either.
These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be to take back the defective chair.
In addition to the legal obligation, this is also standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not answered.
The question again.
In the order and on the invoice it is stated that the goods are delivered to a room of your choice.
The freight forwarder is company "NAME".
I just called there.
They told me that they were only delivering on the doorstep - because of 'PRS_ORG'.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know any person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
Am I not going to call?
I had formulated a question
Theatrical historian Günther Rühle dies at the age of 97
He has distinguished himself as a theatrical critic and as a director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theatrical story.
Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
There is the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man gets older".
The shocking diarium of a slow farewell to the world led by theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book is, “I’m already witnessing my life’s thanks here.”
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL
According to Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was a good 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported to Austria annually will not be collected

Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I got a lot of great tips for the perfect goulash a week ago.
That was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and butterfly!
Thanks again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and want to cook rouladen for the first time at New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my PRS_ORG?
My English isn't so good anymore, but I get it.
It's about a refund of € "NUMBER"
I was informed by e-mail on January 18th that the refund was made.
But to this day, the money has not been received from me.
Would you please check it out?
Where there are still Christmas roasts in the room Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is one of the Christmas days like the fir tree and the gifts.
You haven't got any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube output stage contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME controllers, you can set the desired level and the decay content of your sounds.
Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that can be used to reduce the sound level without altering the gain and distortion.
Further up it already sounded that you can even make a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller, if it goes out loud.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL controllers, the full potential of the VT+ series can be exploited in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal present here is processed with a box simulation, so that even when using a headphones or during direct recordings you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression.
A CD or MP3 player can be connected to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also donate a VFS5 foot button, you can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, turn the effect blocks on/off and tap the pace of the corresponding compatible effects.
This is indispensable for live use.
With its new powerhouses, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I had seen it that way with others.
Is it possible to send the lamp back?
Since it hangs too low for over a dining table?
So I would like to send them back.
Can you help me with that?
And the dresser?
Will we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Have you ever sat on the PRS_ORG chairs?
If I can't, I'd be happy with a discount or voucher.
I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for goods that I do not need are a lot.
I just received my delivery and would have liked to know if screws were provided as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the 'PRS_ORG' mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time was not worth it

Iran sees progress on nuclear deal negotiations
Progress is being made in the negotiations for a revival of the international nuclear agreement, according to Iranian data.
“Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda,” Iran’s chief negotiator Ali Bagheri told Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development", because at first there was not even agreement on the issues to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Viennese talks for the revival of the agreement after almost a week of interruption had been continued.
Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Great Britain, China, France and Russia are taking part in the negotiations.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - Free State now federal state with highest corona incidence
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in Germany.
As the only state, the value is above the 1000 mark.
Thuringia is the only federal state to have been above the 1000 mark in the corona incidence on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had always had the highest incidence in Germany, this figure was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had decreased slightly, but had also been above the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 other deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated intensive care in hospitals on Sunday.
There may be reporting delays on weekends.
In addition, the health offices have been overloaded for weeks and hardly get behind with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since delivery is only in early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it to the parcel and drop it off at the post office, wasn't it?
I don't have to click/specify/fill anything else here.
That’s what I want to avoid, that’s why I write to you.
I would like to accept the return at my own expense.
8 euro return fee is a naughty thing in my eyes.
It's Time for Change
"MBundestag greeted me, I am in the Chamber of Assembly in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
“Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, you can say one thing: it is not existent.
We have come into a winter stare and have extended the summer hole to a few months.
“What is the problem?
Yeah, what was it about?
To a large extent, this may simply be related to the dissatisfaction as to how some things have gone and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, the impression has been more and more that many here really still have a buck on the MBundestag.
“What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is asked which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a heap of shards.
After some back-and-forth writing, several people from the community have found themselves wanting to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to urge everyone to participate, but this is the only way that this project can continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a discord server on which we can exchange ideas and work out concrete things.
You can join the server via this link.
Objectives:
* How will the Bundestag work in the future?
* Which existing orders need to be changed/adapted/removed?
* How should we perform outside in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair electoral system?
I’m pretty sure I’ve forgotten a lot, but what’s not bad is that we end up with the Discord.
If you have desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lampshade from you that will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big / chunky for this and is not suitable for my taste.
I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also rather sad, as the “NAME” is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: is the blanket "PRS_ORG" also available in excess size, i.e. in 240/240 for example?
I have to be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be picked up in a timely manner.
And I ask you to arrange that now.
I do not have a suitable packaging, but will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for pick-up - they have to clarify how this can work.
PRS_ORG can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there any instructions for assembly?
How long do I have to get this or decide to return it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I liked.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, nowadays she rarely eats meat.
I was also a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I’ve always wanted to be vegan, and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
For a long time I thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I also supported animal cruelty.
So I decided to go vegan.
At that moment I had the impression that displeasure arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and meant she knew where her meat came from and reduced animal suffering as a vegetarian.
Now I wonder if my answer was to "plump"?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without putting it on.
It greets a harmonious vegan (;
This is not an exception according to Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
You do not release your PRS_ORG from the legal requirements for distance sales.
I am not on the spot on the assigned date on which the PRS_ORG picks up my return.
Since I can’t be there because of a funeral, I can’t change that either.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pick-up date?
From 01.02. "Number" I'll be back all the time.
Lahnsteiner Wehr prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euros grant from the country
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz handed over a grant notice of 45,000 euros to Mayor Peter Labonte for the new water rescue truck from the volunteer fire brigade Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in use since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this,” says Lahnstein Mayor Peter Labonte.
The truck is used by the diving squadron Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and under water, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, there is a long-term expectation of increasing deployments: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the continued increase in the use of Lahn as a leisure flow, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations but I synced, removed and reloaded the app NOTHING worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has taken me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, that's it.
I would like to order 3 items from the collection of PRS_ORG for June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order process?

Thank you for standing up for the whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in a similar activity in the state service, that is, we were also weapons bearers in the executive, I do not want to go further!
I always find the question of right and left very simplified.
In principle, however, one should say that of course the public servant comes more from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it is also clear that people on the right should also be magically dressed in a special uniform and weapon carrier. Of course, it is also clear that these people can't handle the lived reality, because you have, besides the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women and even homosexuals (and with that I don't mean now the exaggerated feminine cliché gays, but they do not even have to leave you in doubt.
But these marginal groups also represent, even if it sounds strange in my experience, a conservative attitude, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel rather less picked up by excessive left-wing politics, even if this policy supposedly advocates for them or thinks they have to make it right, but they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, as of course police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right there, but that they can openly express their opinion there or even openly forge any plans that threaten the state is completely exaggerated in the media and annoys me.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers who have often been on foreign missions often start to flat-scale due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial to politically incorrect.
It also happens that there will be times when right-wing people meet who have a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, this is well combated in my opinion and also counteracted with political education and education!
Germany is so very internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I do not understand, I ordered the other basket on the German side as well.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered in November.
It was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer available.
I’ve been talking with “NAME” before.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other PRS_ORG basket for NUMBER Euro in black to Germany or this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
but at the top of the wooden part are two deep notches that have been filled with something yellow
and on the mirror itself is a small scratch
More orderly by child?
I’ve been doing one thing for a long time (W32).
I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, very little free time), but all my life I get it more bad than quite to manage my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases where everything stays, and then and then it grabs me and I clean up and clean up.
But it’s never really “that someone could come to visit spontaneously.”
My husband is (unfortunately) not better, but it does bother me somewhere but usually loses household simply against work and dissatisfaction.
The kitchen is cleaned the most regularly as we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to get more orderly with your child?
We don’t have one yet, but this question has been troubling me for a long time.
Because for me I have no incentive, it just doesn’t bother me so much, as long as there is no visit and, for example, there is always fresh clothes and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a greater incentive with your child or do you remain sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, high-quality and anatomically preformed cut, offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit and thus allows for almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further embossing on the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and squats)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System has more than doubled to further increase the comfort.
Seamless stretch panels on the joints reduce friction (axles, arm and squats)
High-quality preforms in the lower back area and in step ensure a tight, perfect fit.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back zipper and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and fitting the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face at the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head hood)
Soft zone in the collar improves sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment by means of a flexible, gentle Velcro closure, which does not adhere to the lamination or to the seams
Double zippered cuffs on the arm and ankle joints combine a wrapable inner cuff with a soft, laminated neoprene outer cuff
45° notch at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and resilience during tightening.
Long zipper on the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the jumpsuit without hood
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Zippers on arms and legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels flush bonded with outer and inner overlap
Edges of the outer cuffs lined for greater load-bearing capacity
Edges of the inner cuffs notched for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system is designed to fix the computer in place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common bracelet computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-insecure personality disorder?
I have a training in software development and have been learning for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I realize more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-insecure (or anxiously avoiding) personality disorder (AVPS).
That means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and therefore I am shy.
I don’t have a problem talking to people on a factual level, but I find it very difficult to have casual conversations and have been told many times that I act unapproachably (which I think has already gotten better).
Can I become a social worker?
I do not want to work as a street worker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in, for example, addiction counseling or family assistance.
But I don’t know if the actual day-to-day work is really the way I imagine it is, and it’s difficult to find something on the internet.
The ÄVPS already leads to problems in my job (for me, emotionally), because it draws me down every time there is something to complain about my code (“already the simplest things are hacked again”) and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help (“I should now really know for myself how to do this”/“I keep him off with my stupid questions”/“they really have to keep me from working”/“ etc.
The problems I will probably have in any profession but I wanted to mention it at the time.
Did you get the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation of that either.
I am waiting for an appointment to pick up
What do you mean by return please?
If I downloaded a book on the PRS_ORG, the message your PRS_ORG does not authorize this book
Are there problems?
I was chatting with PRS_ORG, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) absorbed with the feed breaks down the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into the individual protein building materials (amino acids) and in turn builds up its own proteins from these, which it also needs for plumage formation.
The plumage formation in nesting and the plumage regeneration in the mouse-forming bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high load for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio may not be administered during breeding, otherwise it may cause incubation.
Following this moderate administration of NEKTON-Bio should be reverted to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation).

1 g of NEKTON organic on 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/feed daily.
One coated measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON organic.
In the case of severe plumage damage, twice or three times the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the approach of plumage regeneration is visible.
The normal dose is then administered until the plumage rebuilding is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to announce that my order has arrived damaged and pictures have been attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement by a community employee in opposition to the statutes
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A walnut tree is to be felled on our property.
Submit a request to the community.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees and thus the walnut is not part of the statutes.
In the statutes, however, the walnut is explicitly indicated as a tree to be protected.
Can I rely on the employee’s statement or not?
On the one hand, I have to be able to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your comments.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for that.
I have not received a message
Well, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What was more expensive?
Yes, I think, only the question is yes, if I can pay in euros and have the blanket delivered to me to Germany
Can you check that out?
Report: Severe road accident at Selb

As the press alert of the police currently reports (14:03 a.m.), a car has come into the back traffic during overtaking.
There are wounded.
I understand.
Well, then thank you again for being so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
Happy Christmas to you first!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is moderately good, because my dear head is just thinking up everything you can think up.
In short, I need advice, and best of all, from people who somehow know my situation -- so from you.
I'm doing the ref right now.
Originally I studied something else and worked there in one area (to stay at least a little anonymous, I do not name anything more accurate here).
But it was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that I could enjoy more.
At some point I ended up at the Magisterium and I was sure that it was - even if the framework conditions are much more inflexible than in my previous profession, but I didn't care.
I have now arrived at the third “I google other job advertisements”.
And it's only half a year.
In the paintings before, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after which I can still swing around.
But I'm absolutely done right now.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
Now it’s a vacation, but there’s still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress resistant, but there was my weekend and my working day my working day.
I was free.
And the stress at work didn’t matter at the moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are those rigid structures that bother me.
Basically it is fun and from the outside the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I’m completely drained out and wondering how much stress my body endures before it completely closes – if it doesn’t already.
I wonder if I would like this for the rest of my working life - especially if I read some of your posts here - or if I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take my time off when I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but was paid appropriately for it and together in a team what has worked out and not as a single fighter like the case now.
But then I wonder if I did not get back to the same place in a year as I am now and I am dissatisfied.
You realize it’s all kind of confused, but maybe you have outside advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation, which I’m completely done and start crying at the slightest thought.
I’m not going to make decisions that emotionally right now, that’s probably not going to lead to anything good.
But maybe your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me.
Thank you for reading and apologize for the crying undertone of me.
I hope my situation is at least a little clear.
Since its launch in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has evolved steadily, which has led, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology and the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art when it comes to sound.
Thanks to VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on component analysis and amp circuitry, the VTX amplifiers have an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is partly based on real analog circuits, because they simply get the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances only bubble.
With VOX's "Tone Room" software, you can even correct and bend historical facts at the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound and modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which again led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as more and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two loudspeakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed so that all guitarists in search of maximum sound diversity can find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a bold sound, a nuanced playback of game dynamics and string pitch, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that especially the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
Equipped with a 12AX7 tube, the Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reflects the behavior, subtle nuances and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic loses at Clippers
The defeat series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine, but it’s not enough to win the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually positionable and foldable Velcro splitters, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for every type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
One possible fitting would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for further lenses.
You can also store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for photo-extraordinary things.
Drone pilots also make the ideal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the almost three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have done great damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
So far, the Tehuya volcano eruption in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa at 84 days.
There is no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists have no longer dared to predict when it might end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable,” said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the state-owned TV channel RTVE.
Damage in millions
In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000-degree lava has destroyed nearly 2,900 homes and other buildings, RTVE reported.
Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a metre-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1,700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new headlands with a total size of about 50 hectares were created by cooled lava.
Especially the banana cultivation, which is extremely important for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis before the volcano eruption, was severely affected.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, further land severely impaired, the newspaper "El Pais" wrote.
Christmas and the Gifts
Christmas is coming and especially the children will not be able to wait for the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something seductive in itself.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still holds our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss had been a peace-building "social treaty of natural peoples", can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas Became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to giving gifts.
Previously, gifts were handed over in one way or another on Christmas Day.
The background to this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into her window in one night in order to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional way of giving came the popular custom in Germany to fill the boots with gifts, especially for children.
Protestants stumbled upon this custom because they reject intermediaries between God and men as "holy worship."
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther turned Nicholas into a child of Christ, thus establishing a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
However, since most Protestants no longer see such detailed questions so closely, only few are upset that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still an integral part of the pre-Christmas season, similar to the use of Martin with Martin singing and Martin moving.
Today, in boots at the door and under the Christmas tree, you can find everything your heart desires from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources show a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian countries, however, there is a cheerful muddy muddy muddy about the question of who is bringing the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region, whether the Christmas child appears on Christmas Eve or the Santa Claus, who is in principle a kind of Nicholas, to whom some peculiarities have been assigned over time.
These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, its sledge pulled by reindeer and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Jesus Child.
In Scandinavia, fabulous creatures sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought some fame to Father Frost.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation in the course of the Hussite wars, the child Christ is responsible for the handing over of the gifts.

I asked for a return label for my order "NUMBER" last week and this morning.
I was told that I was being sent one.
Since I haven’t received one yet (in the SPAM folder either), I wanted to ask how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot dead by police on Saturday.
Police said callers had reported a man who had gone to a bank and a bookmaker's business with a gun.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that could be stopped shortly afterwards by officials.
There were shots and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?

The decorative luminaire blends harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The luminaire is simply positioned and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Lighting duration max. 10 h.
- The robust plastic version can be used outdoors all year round.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow with color inside.
On the other hand, “Smart Stone” is completely harmless: the sun alone makes this solar light shine in a fascinating way – either in white or colored light (in six different shades).
The edgeless, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a natural-shaped large pebble, this modern light object presents itself by day.
Its organic roundings fit in any natural environment – whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed.
He also does well in the vicinity of larger pebbles and findlings, where he knows how to stand up thanks to his size.
You can save yourself large preparatory work: as a solar lamp, »Smart Stone» does not need either supply pipe or batteries.
Place the "lighthouse" in any place that is illuminated by the sun during the day.
Two ground skewers are included to ensure a firm hold if needed.
The matt white plastic cover itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar panel discreetly conceals “Smart Stone” inside, along with his battery and two LEDs – one for white and the other for colored light.
The battery already charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
When dawn breaks in, Smart Stone begins to shine automatically; in what color, you determine for yourself: Six attractive light colors are available to you – in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the shutdown also takes place automatically as soon as the battery charge level has decreased to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle begins again the next day.
I’ve done this several times, it doesn’t work.

Pill Problem
Hello dear women,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year reddit is actually my first post.
To my problem: I started taking the pill about five years ago, especially because I had such incredibly bad pain during the period and shit PMS before the period.
Now I would like to leave this again, because I already have to take enough medications due to chronic diseases that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten from 0 to 100 explosive pimples on my last two-year break and these everywhere.
So superficial, but it put a lot of strain on me and I didn't feel comfortable.
During the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
Perfume-free and without dunes is already my cosmetics, but maybe there is something that someone can recommend to me.
Unfortunately, the gynaecologist didn’t take me so seriously and the dermatologist’s appointment is yet to come.
Thank you to everyone who reads the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had prebupertary severe eczema, then a time of rest, then large-area clotting and the acne issue.
I have also tried everything possible in the course of chronic illness and have been stuck on a sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food, because nothing else really worked well.
It can also be good that hormone is simply the worm in it, but if you have a construction site like me everywhere you would rather not go looking for what else goes wrong.
I already had her colleague semina o.ä.

110 kV earth cable will be built in 2022
The approval for the installation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The planning decision of the Lower Bavarian government paves the way for construction to begin in 2022.
This has now been announced by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres long earth cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the municipality and the existing 110 kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
my order from 03.01.21 with the order number "NUMBER" has only arrived at us in parts so far.
The blue call number: "PRS_ORG" with the shipment number "NUMBER" was returned by "PRS_ORG" with the note "Not possible to deliver".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
Have a nice start to the week!
You can forget, I explained this several times yesterday!!
This is a glass chest of drawers and the whole sides are broken, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken
The dresser is in my apartment and PRS_ORG refuses to come to the apartment because of the PRS_ORG provisions
This means that the dresser cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment
Thanks for the message
Why only 20 euros?
The original value of this chair was EUR NUMBER
No, it is for all books, that is why the request at PRS_ORG, as it is probably a general problem
Ref: Class planning (EK)
Hi, ladies and gentlemen,
I’ve been in the ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I still have big problems planning my lessons in geography.
Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so in principle I can only use the board, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, I can only copy s/w for free at school (which is annoying for earth exploration).
It takes me a long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors and with me every hour is actually a matter of its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand I do not want to invest excessively much time for simple lessons (I also need them for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather dissatisfied.
Hence also the worksheets.
Maybe I can find a teacher of geography how to work with the book in a time-efficient way.
I'd really like it.
I would like to return the PRS_ORG from the order.
I have actually already opted for a new one at PRS_ORG, but I would like to process the returns as soon as possible.
The trade fears because of the 2G regulation about the Christmas business.
In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or recovered are allowed.
The trade considers this unnecessary and laments sales cuts.
He also has a possible solution.
From the point of view of the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations spoil the important Christmas business for retail.
Sales declines are to be complained about in transactions with items of non-daily demand, HDE CEO Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a recent HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the rest of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive climax of the year is now often a hole without soil," Genth said.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost just under a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It only works well in the food retail as well as in the online sector.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
Purchasing with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director.
“2G does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic,” he said.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high level of staffing.
The ban must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer only had to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all shops with the volume received on that day.
Sample checks should also suffice in the retail sector, as is already the case in public transport under the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
The real estate group Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The most recent frequencies without 2G were at a good 75 percent of the pre-corona level, the sales at about 90 percent.
These figures will now fall safely in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers are trying to find solutions and get approved.
This includes the so-called tape solution, in which "visitors, for example, can provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to a club hotel - can enter all shops undisturbed".
I recently ordered and delivered the PRS_ORG.
The mirror has a scratch and on the frame is also an error that has been attempted to be covered with a yellow filler.
That looks unpleasant.
I would like to give the mirror back and have already packed it back into the package and glued it on.
What do I need to do now for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities ensures the adjustment of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitive to operate.
The luminaire generates a very luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiance angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work on either the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables remote control of the luminaire in TV studios or when the luminaire is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is the slot for the NP-F batteries (not included)
The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage locations, one of the memory keys is occupied and finished simply by pressing it for a longer time.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is switched off, so that the known situation stands again when it is switched on - Very practical during studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain color temperatures.
Working with battery one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality results from the possibility of operating with low-cost NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a battery tester equal to built-in - for each of the two battery compartments a value in the two display displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is of course possible to supply the headlight continuously with power via the supplied power supply.
The design of the headlight is very simple.
You have to attach a 16mm sleeve as a connection, so you can directly attach it to your photo stand.
The inclination can be reliably adjusted by means of fixing on both sides.
It has been ensured that the mechanical components are also extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a tilt joint is included.
Great is that a bag is also included in the delivery.
This allows you to safely transport or store the luminaire with all the accessories you may still want to buy.
Too bad I got it and it's too small :(
"Party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a triumphant comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two in a series of victoryless Hessen were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga defeat.
“It’s crazy what the guys have done today,” said coach Oliver Glasner of DAZN, shouting out a “package praise to everyone who was there.”
Initially, it looked like a new damper for the Frankfurters, who are now in ninth place, were still below their expectations.
Patrik Schick had led the Leverkuseners with 2-0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am incredibly happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Defender Christopher Lenz, who has been back on the pitch for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his overcame muscle injury, also emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly great," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
However, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on the upcoming tasks, but also sees itself well-positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It’s extraordinary that we all have players fit in December, that all players are physically in a top condition.
It’s top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to “go on step by step and remain modest” and carry the tasks “at this level” until the turn of the year.
Next on Wednesday, in the course of the English week, a away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 hrs., Sky) is on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to a mistake on my part.
I tried to call PRS_ORG and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be shipped directly to me again or do I have to wait for the money to be transferred back and place the order again?
Unfortunately, I would not be ordering again because it has taken a long time.
Have you ever sat on the PRS_ORG chairs?
Dampers for handball women ahead of quarter-finals against Spain
Germany’s handball women sneaked off the floor after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty eyes.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection in the 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers a hard defeat and now has to run against host Spain in the quarter-finals.
“We were far too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent,” said Federal coach Henk Groener.
We have to act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
This was a bad game of all, which we have to clear,” said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for the entry into the semi-finals, there must be a significant increase against the 2019 World Cup second on Tuesday in order to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive.
The best German pitcher in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was back room player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
“We just weren’t there – neither in the attack nor in the defense,” Xenia Smits admitted, demanding: “We need to look ahead quickly.”
From front to back not at the height
Unlike the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a rapid 0:4 backlog after seven minutes.
Only goalmaker Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Greyseels successfully completed a quick match.
However, the initial ignition that was hoped for was not.
Against the aggressive cover of the Danes, the German women could hardly set themselves in the scene - and if they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of the Scandinavian women.
So the game at the 3:10 had run early after 20 minutes, especially since back room player Mia Zschocke a little later because of a hard foul on her opponent also saw red.
In the quarter-finals, she will be able to participate again.
It was only in the final phase of the first half that the DHB selection came a little better into play and reached at least five goals until the break.
The already quiet hope for a catch-up after the change was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
Again, the Groener protectors sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-arranged opponent, who is one of the medal candidates in the final round.
As a result, the German team was no longer able to increase their performance and left as a clear loser.

The title is given, I work as a vaccine doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly vaccinated in nursing homes.
Since these are soon to a large extent finished, it is then partly in vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organisational and human aspects and also medical questions, unless they are related to one personally (e.g. "I take medication X, this can be compatible with the vaccination.").
My area of responsibility is the education for the vaccination, the indication position (person is entitled to a vaccination according to corona vaccination regulations and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (I have never happened before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, e.g. medical professionals.
In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have any, but "only" (for God's sake no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, but they cannot (may?) perform vaccinations, so that I also carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Serious "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "guardian"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" has been made for intense reflection.
But unlike many previous days, the term in the “Host mi?” series this time remained unadvised by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one “has to go fast.”
That, people heard from the TV presenter, was completely wrong.
On which the man from Amberg communicated the solution and thus probably caused astonishment in many Oberpfälzern.
"The skinner," the spectators learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes out the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, interviewed by Bavarian television for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the notion that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known word "Houdern".
This closed a gap in education - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
There is always the following error message after confirmation: opens - someting went wrong - try again later.
I restarted, connected, synchronized, and repaired the PRS_ORG.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice at the road bike- really so resistant to breakdowns?
This morning I woke up eagerly because I wanted to train at least a little in preparation for my bike tour next week.
Said, did, and I drove off on my road bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what lurks in so every downtown (this time: thank you Krefeld!)
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, my back tire and loud sizzling didn’t want to join the rest of the track anymore.
Due to the day of the week I had no real opportunity to get a spare coat and replacement hose, I had to turn around with a half bad mood and take the first train home.
It wasn’t that bad in terms of mood, maybe it’s better if I practice this with the tyre change before the bike ride.
Now I have a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance ahead of me for several days, I would be extremely unhappy with this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, the day I picked up the bike came to 14h 120km!) and who had already called them suboptimal because he drove with them for years on roll.
But if I think that I still have to change tires after 80-90kms, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I came into conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn’t have the Marathon Plus tires; they should be unplatable.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really so indestructible?
I don’t want to spend 40 euros or more, just to be disappointed.
I also wonder: I am currently on the road I think 25x622.
They are also (apparently?) available on the Marathon Plus tyres, but the majority are already broader.
Is this a problem?
Or would you advise me on other tyres for a road bike in general?
The Schwalbe side seems to me absolute! Laienwissen rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for the help and dear greetings!

After the release of our new high-end B 100-6 OHM broadband, it was only a matter of time before our SOLO series would get offspring again.
SOLO 15 is the name of the new offspring and is visually reminiscent of the great models with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, this construction proposal includes a suitably designed foot directly to raise the speaker to the correct listening position.
This has no influence on the acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the conditions at home.
In principle, the SOLO 15 is very suitable for people in whom the maximum volume plays a rather minor role, but an exceptionally high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm loudspeaker is simply not able to generate such large sound pressure levels almost unfiltered.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it appears remarkably adult and extremely impressive and accurate for its size.
The SOLO 15 was tuned to Tonal with a slight rise in high tones.
This is generally common in broadbands in order to optimize the bundling which is greatly increasing too high frequencies.
Exactly aligned to the listening area, the SOLO 15 impresses with a very clear and fine sound.
Easily turned outwards, the high-tone range can be reduced and thus the sound image can be made warmer.
Thanks to the point sound source, the locating of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereo triangle is sharp and surprisingly precise.
The extremely low mechanical losses of the B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamics that is looking for its same.
The SOLO 15 thus not only complements our SOLO series, but also extends it in terms of resolution and accuracy.
As with all our kits, it is advisable to consider the final appearance of the speaker at the beginning, in order to plan corresponding changes in construction.
For example, if you want to veneer the housings, the lowering of the loudspeaker must be adjusted accordingly, as the veneer applies material again.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the hardware market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the bottom plate at the appropriate point in order to be able to carry out the cable there later without any problems.
With the help of an upper milling machine, the loudspeaker opening in the front now follows, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be inserted flush later.
On the rear side, this opening should be provided with a 45° chassis in order to make the opening surface of the loudspeaker chassis in the interior as large as possible.
The four bolting points of the B 100 - 6 OHM receive an interruption in the chamfer, as shown in the image "Detail chamfer".
After that, you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two side walls on a flat surface in front of you.
On these are now glued the back wall, the lid, the front and the floor.
The three stiffeners should also be used and glued.
The reinforcements themselves can vary in the material thickness if required, provided, for example, you want to use finished strips from the DIY market instead of making them yourself from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second side is attached.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, i.e. the two sides, as well as the front.
The mounting of the openings of the bass reflex tube as well as of the connection terminal on the rear wall is facilitated by means of a suitable perforated circular saw or a forest drill.
Then you use a round cutter to round off all the edges of the actual box.
The top side of the footplate can also be rounded.
Subsequently, the footplate is firmly glued to the foot of the housing and additionally screwed on with long wooden screws.
This is followed by the drawing and pre-drilling (2.5 mm drill) of the screw connection points of the loudspeaker chassis and the terminal.
After the housing has been cleaned of wood dust (sucking off/blowing out), you start laying the cable.
The easiest way to do this is through the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the rear wall.
The entire and unabbreviated cable is pushed piece by piece through the 8 mm bore in the foot up to the terminal opening and let it stand out there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the housing, the cable is led to the loudspeaker opening and it is also loosely suspended there.
Subsequently, the frequency switch is prepared and used.
The construction plan of the frequency crossing, as well as the corresponding connection plan can be found in the following document:
If the frequency switch is installed and the connection terminal is screwed, the sealing of the 8 mm cable opening in the interior of the box is followed, which is not yet completely closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some skill, you can drop hot glue onto the opening and thus seal it.
Through the opening of the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp, the seal can be checked accordingly.
Then follow the description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected and screwed with the corresponding screws.
Polarity plays an important role in this, so that the plus line (marked cable) must be soldered to the plus pole of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is shortened to the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the tube) and inserted.
For damping purposes, a mat of the damping material is cut into two parts and distributed loosely in the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex channel should be kept free.
Can I place an order now and have it delivered at the beginning of June?
“Hello to all,
> finally we can announce that we are hosting the OSCAST again this year!
> Unfortunately, for known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which has meant a higher planning effort and explains the short-term nature of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per turn, so we will follow the 2021 Oscars with at least 7 beans on stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid delay or other problems.
But hey, it’s still a pandemic – yet we’ll do everything we can to accompany the Oscars as entertainingly as possible.
> It will start around 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan a good meal and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
