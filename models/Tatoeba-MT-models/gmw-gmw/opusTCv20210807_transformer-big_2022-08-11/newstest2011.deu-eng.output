The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "Conditorei".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the SSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuáln.cz has once knocked down members of the new council from the SSD as they master the notorious snake that has become naturalized in recent years, in which today’s coalition partners have been at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced in the past era by Mayor Pavel Bém of the Prague political elite is borrowed from some of the most well-known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark with respect to these new terms.
At least they claim that.
“Who is Voldemort?”
"I don't know."
“I’m more of a novice in Prague politics,” said Luka Kaucki, the new councillor for culture, in response to the test of the “Paten vocabulary”.
But the Councillor Karel Buezina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here, which I use from time to time."
“Otherwise, I don’t think much of a snake.”
From the vocabulary published by the Tageblatt Aktuáln.cz in June before the election congress of the ODS, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those notoriously linked to the Prague magistrate.
The social democrats should define the terms "voldemort", "largest Prague Gulf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "starbing", "betrayal of the capital" and "fade".
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Antonin Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolinek, rejected the test from the outset.
“I don’t care about these things, and how the bourgeois democrats talk to each other is something I don’t judge.”
“It’s important to me how we understand each other as part of our programs,” he said.
As already indicated, Lukác Kaucká allegedly did not realize in the headline above that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-Mayor Bém, Roman Janoucek, is talking.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed during the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole".
“This is the Blanka tunnel,” says Kaucki, adding to safety: “But I know that more from the newspaper.”
And jokingly, "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "Golfhole" is then properly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Buezina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Affairs, Luka Plach, as a Blanka tunnel.
However, both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Luku Plach even knows where this figure is to be found and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some kind of Prague gastronomy," Plach is pretty close to solving the riddle, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janou'ek's companies.
In agreement with Báezina, however, he asserts that he drew this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary was his own.
According to the test participants, there actually does not seem to be a similarly naturalized snake among the Social Democrats.
“I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there’s no such thing with us.”
"We call ourselves by name, sometimes we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of Prague's "SSD Petr Hulansk" - called by his partymates salopp "Hulda".
"In school I was called Báza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Báezina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Denák Aktuáln.cz has tried the name and see - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades the "Opa" or less friendly the "Old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who brought attention to himself before the elections by means of machinations in party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráek" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only nicknames that the Social Democrats allow in the inner-party language.
It is said that Hulánská does not like it to be called "Hulda", but Denák Aktuáln.cz registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of the rubber club rights" is said to have to do with the fact that Petr Hulinsk has acquired his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women "becomes" a witch, she becomes strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
“Men are rarely affected by this fate.”
“Young and healthy women are spared this as they help at work and give birth to children,” one religious sister describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a specialty home for more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, a brochure was issued to stop the “witch hunting”.
But there's a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "The Standard" pointed to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
To be accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighboring Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they poured her petroleum and just set her on fire.
This incident was reported by the BBC server, among others.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointing.
This is after the group tried to "eject" an evil spirit from the woman.
The isolation of “witches” supports the people here without regard to their education.
The standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso as saying: “Eaters of human souls are a danger earlier than they are today,” he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the Gambian president has properly interfered with the president himself.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, as they allegedly participated in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
“For this purpose, he called on shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president’s bodyguard, indiscriminately kidnapped women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an abduction from plants with a hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
Only due to international pressure were the nearly one thousand prisoners released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - but still pays higher rent
An elderly man is leaving the RPG Byty client centre of the coal baron Zdenák Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases for three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just been raised as part of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of a monthly rent of 3,500 crowns, the son is expected to pay 4100 crowns for a 2-bedroom apartment with kitchen of the second category next year.
"And there isn't even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he taps annoyed with his finger on the son's new lease, for whose signing he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-depressed and half resigned.
BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and wait until December 7th, when it intends to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waves off.
“One says this, the other says that,” he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After the New Year, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay a market-friendly rent.
Aktuáln.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havázov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning this Tuesday is breaking full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a caller.
"Rent 2011", so a special touchpad lights up on the touchscreen.
Taped briefly and the device is already spewing out a number sheet.
We have hardly deciphered the number "157" and it is already beeping on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it’s your turn.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask about the rent, but the onslaught in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and the like.
From mid-November onwards, the envelopes in the Ostrava region with the new rental contracts will flutter into the mailboxes of most of the RPG’s total of 44,000 apartments.
The RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent in the letter.
The special counter for the new rentals in the client centre has been open since 18 November.
“The action is going on a little over a week, that is, that’s just the beginning,” the ladies behind the counter reply after a moment of hesitation when the “client” turns out to be a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala’s former miners’ homes are a hot topic.
Prior to the elections, Ostrava-based parliamentary vice-president Lubomir Zaorálek of the SSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder the newspapers are full of it today.
“Twenty years I want a new floor from them.”
"Not even a besch. WC glasses they could change," the man mentioned at the beginning airs up.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners in particular are at the counter to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rent reduction, which promises them RPG, if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who sign the new lease by 15 December, will also benefit from a half-discounted February rent.
So far, however, "deregulation switches" in Havzov are anything but overloaded with demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rentals were here in 2011," the counter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as wall panels where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
“This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal approach,” RPG explains on its websites.
“No one goes to court here,” says one of RPG Byty’s employees and a man on the street in front of the client centre, at least in part.
“I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute,” he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
"Let's see."
“Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media not to sign and so people are still waiting,” she says.
The regulated rent ends with the New Year 2011 in most of the Czech Republic and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klime, director of the RPG Byty housing portfolio, and - in the opinion of the homeowners, the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the tenants is the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstery chairs in the waiting room of Havov, a few red glowing information appear in between.
"The rental increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month", you can read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from RPG’s portfolio, the rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about raising extremely low rental prices of CZK 19.66 per square metre," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent remains at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not increase rents abruptly, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenue from the rental increase (see diagram) the company wants to put back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - above all, these should benefit those who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that belongs to it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
Design and architecture firm Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known Brno buildings come, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini kindergarten.
In a wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (in) are in the baby boom age and the company is concerned that the project architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for the civil engineers to combine their demanding profession and childcare.
The mini kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The small kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the national budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (CZK 2.8 million grants), the necessary facilities and equipment were procured and qualified personnel and operations were provided for the duration of 2 years.
After the funding has been used up for 2 years, Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company providing active assistance in processing the application.
For the children, full-time qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can attend children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time, but the day alternates with several children.
The kindergarten is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the program content in mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can take a look at the children at any time and thus the stress is eliminated when the children are picked up late from a far away kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also developing here.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn-up fish mole.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms was nicknamed "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, the shed-like facades and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of Antonio Gaudi’s Art Nouveau style.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living things.
It is only on closer inspection that one notices that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and well-thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and twisted shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-like shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, ornamental elements of doors, even holes and strips.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the renovation of a house from 1877, which was executed by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old and building a completely new building, but ultimately agreed to Gaudi’s idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
However, the rental house Casa Batlló did not design Antoni Gaudi alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Especially on his drawing board were the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other designers and artists also contributed to the design of the facade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudi.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudi's Casa Milá in the Güell Park, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudi.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed "bone house" by the local residents of its organic forms.
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "gagging house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia.
But also other sculptural elements symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi designed a central heating system for the house, which was unique at the time, with vent channels and typical fireplaces.
Somewhat bizarre her 45-degree inclination already.
In his work, Gaudi consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and was not distracted by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified at the completion two years later that they demanded remedy.
Among other things, the councillors also encountered the fact that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, changes were no longer made, quite the contrary - just fifteen days after the district's request to do so, Josep Batlló filed a request to authorize the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor was a social salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey building goes through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudi also worked with a modern concept for the interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to give up some intimacy during more confidential conversations.
The house was given a rather unusual roof and two more floors by Gaudi’s remodeling in addition to a new facade.
Gaudi’s play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is dressed and the light courtyards are also impressive.
The play of these two colors gives a maximum of light to all floors of the house.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the sunlight.
House Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2005, can now be visited by anyone.
On the first floor is the most spacious and magnificent apartment made available to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year and on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When one found that this was a quite profitable business, one kept the visits, yes, one expanded them to further common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard handle, it is 16.50 euros, students, retirees, groups and holders of tourist ID cards receive a 20% discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon turrets, you should try to make friends with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed grate? Women have different desires than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the size, the state of health and last but not least the sex of the sleeper.
Equally important is the interior in which the mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house that is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm".
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be reversed regularly.
If they do not have enough venting ducts in the core and lie on a solid plate, moisture builds up: It is therefore not excluded that mold forms underneath them.
Of course, when it comes to choosing, it also plays a role in what you are used to.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with soft layer are common, it will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"All the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here."
"For their skinned shoulders, heels and hips they just need a soft layer of visco-foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I also recommend these, among other things, to people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can not receive the "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I bought many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers, these mattresses with visco-foam (memory foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don’t necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of visco foam.
This “miracle” actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it directly clings to the warm body.
Nowhere does it squeeze, at night you don’t roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (burn).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles of the foot, i.e. about 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, i.e. together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For convenience and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms", advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and room furnishers, who has been devoting herself to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for years and presents this topic also in technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are equally high.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grate at different heights and this is far from possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be accounted for on the molding layer and the fine cushion.
"You should not feel the feathers by hand or when you sit down," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special rust type.
Fully padded beds with mattress and undercarriage such as co-grown Siamese twins have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a giant (and clogged sieve).
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even a lifetime warranty, for mattresses.
Every thing has its if and but.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, detachable covers, yet it is advisable to use a mattress protector, which you can easily take off and wash.
Even though today mattress covers are usually made with a circular zipper, so that you get two halves after opening (important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially on your own, often resembles the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of here!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are none in it) and use mattresses with feather skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring core and fine cushion.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly combinations of latex and coconut) for non-adjustable slatted slatted slats with 14 to 18 spring slats (lamellas), with lattice support in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility of regulating the lattice hardness.
Adjustable slatted grids do not include mattresses with a feather skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to the adjustment of the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which allows the spring strips to be pressed in or even bent in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink at points.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "man's mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic vane spring systems (lattoflex) or grids with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are designed.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow for the right mattress and rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Here again a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm cushion, as the Scandinavians, for example, like it.
In the side position, the pillow (along with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Also for mattresses, the new magic word is called "bio".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example castor and soybean oil.
Soybean is used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic means mattresses, which are made of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Va'ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also indulge in microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent when you sleep.
There is also a difference between man and woman.
While in men, a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers have "warming" effect for women.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate the blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets comfortable warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially available polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffnesses of cold foams and visco-foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heels are.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually subject to lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to receive this advantage.
You see, saving on the mattress and the rust is not so easy.
Occasionally, there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the mattress Duofreeze with visco-foamed memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second one is free of charge.
It was the material Tempur that initiated the era of viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the launches.
Tempur becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
In this way, it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing compressive fire, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only in mattresses, but also in other health products, such as special foot pads, which are intended to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to keep the kids under control
Anxiety about your own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to find cars, can locate people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases as the recent traceless disappearance of nine-year-old Aniska Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it should not be larger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been terrified by the case of the missing Aniska, so they are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of impairing your privacy.
“We strive to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy,” says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
“I admit that in individual cases there may be abuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in someone’s pocket without them knowing about it, but we haven’t had such a case yet.”
“Most customers really buy it for safety reasons,” Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Boáková points out, however, that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things if they don’t want to be controlled.”
"At first, the mobile phones raised great expectations from the parents, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new surveillance devices," says Ms. Boáková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always checks whether the child has any electronics to locate it with."
“Today it’s the phone.”
"If such surveillance devices were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
“In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, she acknowledges that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both cars and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it is immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of more expensive devices, even an inclination meter is integrated, i.e. if you fall down and lie motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position," says Mr. Eech.
In his opinion, similar services could also do smart mobile phones with navigation, you only need to use a special software.
The problem with current locating devices is that they are either devices in matchbox size that resemble trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin von der Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are therefore being tested in the present.
“This has the advantage that the possible attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring or locating device.
"Or he realizes this only after a while, which gives the police a lead in time," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle locating.
So to the combination of location function using the GPS system (just like the navigation system in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap all of the Czech Republic but only hold them for two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ignition cords, to be detonated with explosive devices.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometers of firing cord to the army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the armed forces have provided for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cord from STV Group, a. s. for 40 million crowns.
In his reasoning for purchasing this huge amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to research by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed, this statement shows that every year the entire army must undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training - from all generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Secretary of Defense Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek are not exempt.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be justified in half.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would be enough for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that to train each new professional soldier two meters of firing cord is completely sufficient, then the army has created a reassuring supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also in view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
In the process, soldiers of the Rapid Operations Brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises due to the lack of means are severely restricted.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't understand why they buy so many ignition cords from us."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a trader would like to meet as much as possible," says the sales manager of STV Group, Jan D.
Jan Pejáek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justified the purchase of hundreds of miles of firing cord by saying that the army would have covered itself with this “munition” for at least ten years.
However, the STV Group’s Jan Dácki only speaks of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are also possible," admits one of them, who wants to remain unnamed in order not to be accused as a soldier of criticism of the army.
At the end of the service life, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometers fuse line.
“They cost us sixty percent less than last year’s delivery of 244 kilometers,” spokesman Pejáek told us.
The annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians, liquidating ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army has for several years barely exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can consume before the end of the service life.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, it also allows for flexible purchases of more modern and thus reliable ignition cords.
The Ministry of Defence has enormous problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak people’s army prepared for their campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, who addressed MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years from the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old ignition cords, which they have bought so "cheaply" today.
To this day, I find the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition
The victorious placement in the "Small Entrepreneurs of the Year" competition has helped Luku Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Winner of the last year of the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Luku Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success sounds like a film scenario.
Luki Pytloun liked to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there is a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings from his vacation work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he acquired a decaying house with five apartments.
Considering that he was then a university student in the sixth semester, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Luku Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested the entire profit back into the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another top-notch hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of Pytloun hotels have already signed up," said the entrepreneur number one last year.
“A large part of this license sale to operate hotels had just been won in the Entrepreneurs of the Year competition,” Mr. Pytloun adds appreciatively.
The victory has earned him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, often congratulating me later, and I have to say that it did really well,” he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don’t have to win right away, every visualization is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise not have come at all.
“With some people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I still have regular business relationships to this day.”
The fame associated with the success, in his opinion, also impacts a little on each of his employees.
And there he has the seventy.
“I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that receives universal recognition.”
I really don’t see this as just a personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
“My name has only come a little bit to the fore,” says Luku Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
Victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first rank of the Vodafone company competition of the year in the past year was received by Karel "Rsk", the owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury praised the efforts he had made to stamp out a company from the small toolmaking industry in seská Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
“I can say that this appreciation has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition,” he said.
At the beginning of Farmet’s company history was an effort to do something useful.
And then, when the state offered his father Karel Arsky a small workshop to lease as compensation for the property seized by the communists, he did not hesitate long, let go of his career in the company in which he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few comrades of his father.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it is only through the success of the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it has also become aware of the non-professional public.
"Not only are our customers now much more aware of the Farmet brand, but our foreign partners have also started to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, which is more valuable," says Karel.
Last year, however, Farmet was not just a sign of victory euphoria.
The assessment was based on the company’s economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less the citizens, but especially companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we could not escape this situation.”
“Sales declined by 40 percent, we had to limit production and even resort to redundancies,” explains Karel Arsk.
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
But it managed to get to grips with the situation and keep the company in the black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was not willing to give up - in terms of investment in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training center, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs, and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Arsk.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and so is the number of new employees.
“I wish the new winner a lot of joy in winning – but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel Arsky.
An opinion poll that cleans up with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll on the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical rules have already been eliminated.
To the dubious winner of the next year’s opinion poll “Absurdity of the Year”, the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online advanced.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
For example, the Social Security Administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register when it comes to checks by social security payers," the spokeswoman for SSZ, Jana Bura'ová, said in a statement.
The purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to repeal the nonsensical ones.
This is the fourth time this year that this is part of an entrepreneurial competition, which is organized by the ch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and is enjoying growing popularity in the public sphere.
If last year three thousand people took part in the vote, this year there were four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that only serve to hamper business activity.
"As far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, for example, we are at the forefront of the world," notes Karel Havlácek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of company conditions, compared to the previous year, a poorer place by eight places.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was proclaimed for the first time in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more precisely 105 pointless regulations and orders have already been filed for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for motorways and highways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to present every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The announcement of the competition at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague is part of a event in which political and public figures regularly take part.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and tradesmen of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kul, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, were from the game at the peak of the competition.
"Where the state throws a baton between entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic upswing, so my goal is to lift at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today unnecessarily complicates entrepreneurs' ventures," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical orders are effective.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the entrepreneurs imposed a duty to report to the trade office at the site of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to go with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or kirmes.
This obligation was repealed by virtue of a amendment to the Trade Act.
The duty, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the duty to report to the employment office employment trips of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "Green Card".
All good things are three:
For the absurdity of the year 2009, the regulation was chosen, which imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the office.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement dropped.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair enterprises.
“We want to support those companies that are aware of the impact of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives,” says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, who is the evoker and guarantor of this competition, as well as the “Rebel of the Year” competition.
This year’s first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition was attended by companies for whom success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and provides enough material for an independent article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject matter of their activity, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This concerns, for example, people with disabilities, such as personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then take part in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for disabled children for seventeen years.
A paper factory from Podábrady also provides exemplary care for its disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title "Responsible company of the Central Bohemia region"; in the Vodafone company of the year competition, it took third place in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a fluent and also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
“We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimize the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment,” explains its Managing Director Milus Ryznarová.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Istria nad Labem, in turn, cares about the health of its employees and has therefore purchased ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, as well as promoting home work for its employees and in company actions, it uses cartering services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the foundation "People in Need", which provides concrete help to the local Roma community," says Ondej Sucha, the representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is worth noting the activity of the cleaning company "Prana" from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses.
"We are making contributions to our employees for food, for the journey to work, to increase their qualifications and for the holiday," says Josef Strapa from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the category Responsible Company of the Year, all district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed in the application and sent it to the organizer by August 15.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsible Company of the Year" competition, but they were not disqualified in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition."
“Separate registration for this competition is not possible because it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the hosting agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests by the police in a public tender
In the building of the Soil Fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboa G. was taken by the detectives in handcuffs.
The latter had allegedly attempted to manipulate a public competition currently taking place to settle restitution claims in such a way that the plots offered in competition belonged to a specific interested party.
This is said to have paid Luboa G. half a million for it.
“At this point, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the fraudulent conduct of a public competition,” said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner Prosecutor’s Office of the newspaper “Právo”, who could not provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released from the police.
How he could manipulate public competition can only be speculated about, given the scarce official information.
The spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubomir Serena pointed to Právo’s question that the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Land Fund during a public competition.
“It was about a client and not one of our employees,” she said.
The public competition had the correct designation, according to Ms Aerná, "request for the offer of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants showed interest in the offered land.
"These persons shall, within the framework of the request, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be paid for by the transfer than the declared land value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential buyers is determined, then the land fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokeswoman.
It appears that Luboa G. had information on who had filed for the request, and since he was a self-eligible person, since he had purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Apparently against a fat repayment.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Lubo G. has had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
For example, he also played a role in the cause of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitutions for which site decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time, for example, Luboa G. also purchased land from the Land Fund for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access magistrates to the Borské pole industrial area was planned.
Later, he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house right in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At the time, the town hall had to give small contributions with a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs rise by several hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and sewage fees and rents for district heating and in some places will also grow.
As of January, families will have to draw several hundred crowns more monthly from the wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating supplies will also be more expensive.
Electricity alone costs households a few hundred more crowns a year.
The high-power prices have been lowered by all major suppliers, which is due to the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic systems.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is precisely when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, you can expect a few hundred more crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Above all, larger places are planning price increases.
For example, from January onwards, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kroner more per month for district heating, and more than 1000 kroner more per year for families in Liberec.
The residents of Prague, in turn, face 9 percent higher water and sewage fees in the event that the city raises infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains one of the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage fees are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, in which from January the so-called rental regulation is omitted.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 apartments in âstâ nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this rent increase wants the company to be prosecuted.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just works too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, exceptionally also a good whisky, which was stolen from the house bar to the father.
These are the drinks that require the most emergency treatment for drunk Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen.
No exception are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is evident from the experiences of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the reception of children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Ludák Pelikán, the chief physician of the children's department at the middle Bohemian hospital Hocovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in disposing of a bottle from the bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of being able to mix it with juice, then it doesn't smell as strong," explains the chief doctor.
The spokeswoman of the faculty hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"The most common is Fernet or Rum."
“This is today’s alcohol trend, especially in primary schools.”
"Individually, it was also about Slibowitz, which is taken from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital are no exception.
In front of the hospital in Hocovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the Pediatrics Department of the Motol Hospital, where the ambulances delivered drunken pupils from near and far.
“A girl had to be hospitalized four times.”
"Her career began when she was 12 years old when she was first introduced to the blood with 3.5 promille alcohol and in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at some dance party in the exhibition grounds in Holeáovice."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor said.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when pushing with their offspring that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, a real dependence in the true sense of the word is not a matter for children.
"Alcoholism is to be understood as a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
For those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic,” explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol hospital, Ms Jurinová, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local department for children and adolescent medicine by mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by the parents or, if necessary, by the police will not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink a bottle of liquor in the school bench, there are three seasonal amplitudes, according to Mr. Pelikán, on which one hundred percent can be relied: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either for grief because of the bad testimony or for joy on the holidays."
“On Walpurgis night, I also experienced seven drunk children at once in the reception,” emphasizes Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who struggles with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning, caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be eliminated in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They're clearly better off, because after the 'glorious' experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without anything hurting anywhere."
“They’re just a little confused about where they are,” admits Dr. Pelikán, at least sometimes ruining the patient’s good mood by listing the cost of treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed will come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Once in a while, I used this as a means of education when I told the children directly at the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single party like this," Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to regression procedures to claim the costs necessary for the healing of the drunk children from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two of the five L-159 light fighters exchanged by the Czech Ministry of Defence for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is located.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in the possession of a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen at maneuvers or flight shows abroad.
This is the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - took over them last week.
When she physically expeditions the planes from Vodochody, according to Jan Pejáek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The one-seater fighter L-159, in turn, was separated from long-term aircraft and this without further deposits and investments by the Ministry.
"The double-seat L-159T1 has been replaced in its current state and appearance," Pejááek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to live without two-seater fighters, as the Defense Ministry signed a 200-million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to rebuild four redundant L-159 to the two-seater version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second plans to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejáek, EADS has committed to enforcing the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is a customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they are intended to train pilots from NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the buyer how he realizes the thing," Pejáek said.
The economic newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was still approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defense had not tendered for purchasing, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Department argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only used 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
Incidentally, the purchase of the aircraft Casa should also have a judicial follow-up.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice: the reason: it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of an all-European call for tender, and by no means by responding to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last one is due to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index fingers are longer than the ring finger are obviously at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is because it is related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our findings show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick’s Cancer Research Institute.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Ms. Eeles added.
From 1994 to 2009, she and her colleagues in Britain tracked more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer applied as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which form at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that it is precisely the testosterone that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, Václav Pacees, said he was briefly aware of this study, but he did not yet consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven".
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snow cover on Thursday morning.
On the roads and walkways there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicemen in many places were on their way all night.
The D5 motorway between kilometers 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This is what Novinky.CZ, the Dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club, said.
A truck crashed at 91 kilometers, two trucks crashed at 93 kilometers, and there were injuries.
A few cars are also in the trench.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
The drivers should drive right behind Brno at 190 kilometers or drive over Brno and at 182 kilometers at the village of Kávalka.
This is where miles of traffic jams form.
There was also an accident on the D11, just as it was on the way to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, car columns are formed in the Prosek town hall, and the road is also completely clogged.
The safest means of transportation is the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o’clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railroad and the airfield.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven high-speed train connections due to snow.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be aware of the current situation.
Airport Ruzyna has been closed from 11am to 5am on Wednesday.
Most roads in South Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Three side roads are completely impassable around Vyskov, in the Brno area there are occasional snowstorms and in the Blansko area you are forced to use snow mills on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Vákov.
There are still three roads completely closed: Rousov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kuserov and also Zaryatice - Milesovice.
Also here you will have to use snow mills for snow removal.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be re-enabled.
In the Hodonin region, caution is required in the area of the white carp.
On the roads, which are only allowed to be scattered with inert scattering agents for conservation reasons, lies a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, said TK.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of fresh snow fell, most in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slowly stopping snowing.
American soldiers have a new “smart weapon.”
For the first time, American troops have deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, previously known only as XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of forces in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise gun.
Your projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a accuracy of only a few meters.
The special projectiles of calibre 25 mm, which are designed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosives, work practically like small shells.
The projectiles can be programmed so that they can explode not only when impacting the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically does this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact sighting point after which he corrects the angle of elevation, then he only needs to print.
"Let's say they measured 543 meters."
"When you push, the gun charges and shoots down the projectile at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant specializing in computer and maintenance announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the Group, which have so far been distributed to the region, should be accommodated there.
The rental offer had been extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in Astro Park would be better suited to the working methods of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: "With Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
Yesterday’s relocation of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
Frankfurt-based business manager Markus Frank (CDU) said that he had once again won a “Global Player”.
This is a “great location commitment.”
Fujitsu agrees with the city, the settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed early by the management of the intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been the decisive factor.
Now it is about preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative."
The Fujitsu building on Town Hall Square and the neighboring "Little Vertical" were among the most controversial construction projects of the spa town ten years ago with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously used partly as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the then-affiliated computer manufacturer Fujitsu moved into the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold a year later to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu conglomerate considers itself to be the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers and servers, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped layout - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry has its seat, among others.
Amazon blocks server threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is becoming increasingly troubled.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind it after the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic coverts.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
WikiLeaks is increasingly under attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the search lists of Interpol, is said to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks displaced from Amazon servers."
“Free Speech in the Land of the Free,” the revelation activists said on Twitter on Wednesday.
Shortly before, Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic slips in order to cope with the high number of accesses to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks said: “Prima – our dollars are now being spent on employing people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers by WikiLeaks after senator Joe Lieberman’s employees did research, CNN reported, citing Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
“I would have wished that Amazon took this measure earlier given the previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks,” the senator said.
In the meantime, Lieberman called for the platform to be denied the use of servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks' illegal, monstrous and reckless action jeopardizes our national security and endangers lives around the world," the senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is being sought by authorities in Sweden for rape suspicion, is on Interpol’s search list.
According to the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, the exact place is Scotland Yard.
The internet activist has always referred to the investigation in Sweden as an intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats.
"There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is rightly afraid of his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will remain hidden.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper – apparently ironic – said on television that Assange should “be killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
Between the White House and Assange, there was a change of heart.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently announced espionage calls on diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website.”
The U.S. government is now fully investigating the protection of its databases.
The deputy director of the Center for Anti-Terrorism Action, Russell Travers, was appointed as Special Representative, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing “necessary structural reforms” that became necessary after WikiLeaks disclosed the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to check the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it will take care of the security of dissidents and the most active people if they are threatened by the Wikileaks release.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said Philip Crowley, the foreign ministry's spokesman.
“We are ready to protect them if necessary.”
The Ice University
At Gelato University near Bologna, ice cream pastries are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitor from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatine and the gelataio.
The gelatier, in German somewhat antiquated to the ice cream pastry, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream from the cold counter with a spatula, pierces it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don’t have to go to Anzola dell’Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you can't miss the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University has set up the ice cream machine manufacturer in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines will live up to the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for the future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitor from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others simply venture onto the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and after years in a nerve-wracking job wants to make something of her own.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars – and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelates Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also silky suppleness and good consistency.
In his training, Luciano does not forget the cup of cream of the national and generally southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance."
The first step to production seems quite simple.
Luciano tilts the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, the basis for all milk ice cream varieties.
Immediately the lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimentation run free?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the zeitgeist.
Anyone who talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar seed flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, only then it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it sinks into itself, and the customer bites on loud grains of ice.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or at the supermarket’s sweets.
There are also powders and pastes.
“Suppliers will all try to get you dozens of flavored additives.”
“But you should just experiment.”
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all kinds of chocolate seductions.
Now students are allowed to join the ice machines.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream each - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also being carried out on the fruit ice varieties.
More flavoring substances, more fruit puree - taste is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily taste nutier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream makes the working group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture properly highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice making is a computational task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
Lemon ice requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano draws out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzers measure the oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, tables make computing easier.
Making ice does not require as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device helps for the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is beaten creamy at the same time and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small breakdowns do not escape.
The Brazilian Gustavo clogs himself and his classmates with fruit puree from top to bottom when the oversized bar mixer gets out of control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before such a thing happens.”
Inspectors in the twilight
The European Food Authority Efsa is infiltrated by the genetically engineered industry.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
“It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we’ve documented it well,” Christoph Then, CEO of Testbiotech, said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa Expert Group on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbying association for years.
It is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been instrumental in the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa regulations are word-by-word with the position papers of the Ilsi and thus betray the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in Italian Parma.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
For example, a senior Efsa manager has recently switched sides without any restrictions or transitional periods to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians deaf ears.
However, the EFSA cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
It draws on all serious data, including those from the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it said in a statement.
Experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contacts with the industry.
But they would have to disclose it.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This refers to itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics – among other things for the risk assessment of biotechnology without a lobbying mandate.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically engineered plants are currently approved in animals without any feeding experiments and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically engineered corn does on the field,” says Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the entire gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how do you find them?” asks Then accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck thinks so too.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
In this area, as in the US, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Studies that are critical to companies are usually not published.
“The industry controls safety research,” says Hilbeck.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also worried about some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he stood before Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well-known: in September, the excavators had begun to demolish a large piece of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the multi-billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When the building stopped, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You can't go away."
He whispered, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he saw one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with the chunks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The trace of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old trades with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked the demolition in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were grinding into gravel or disappearing into the landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden bunch that was once a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened when the newspapers said in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he told them that he couldn't do anything for the demolition.
And if it does happen, then it is the most reasonable thing to use the stones.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the on average 80 kilos of cubs with them, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in hopes of returning him during a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truck loads.
Approximately half of them are still in the woods, the rest are already sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, housebuilders.
They had come from everywhere and had towed away what suitcases and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the impetus have long since transformed into "mäuerle" or into limitations of herbal beds.
“Actually, this stone is nothing special,” Rongen says.
“It wouldn’t be the political component.”
He gets into his off-road car, takes a tour of his 20-hectare empire.
Jura he studied and aborted, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone trader.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40,000 tons of stones.
He collects his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the Republic's biggest scrap-stone trader.
He's braking.
In the snow are artfully carved sandstones.
“They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke,” he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he swarms.
"My favorite stone."
The road goes up through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once upon a time, the squares belonged to the stand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Stones and stories everywhere in the snow, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart Police Department, reddish granite from the Cathedral of Saint Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be carved by hand and moved with simple pulleys and oxcarts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
“It would be a scandal if you shred something like that.”
He has not become rich, not rich at all.
But the stone dealer employs 14 people today, and a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the residual valuer.
He will have to go to Cologne soon.
There are stones to be saved, too.
Talent struggle for high potentials
There is a lot of pressure on the buffet.
16 students are pushing for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the automaker Volkswagen invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to learn about the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen at the same time.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they enter the labour market and are recruited by others.
And because the universities do not publish statements about the achievements of their students, they try to detect and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is promoting the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes ballpoint pens, rubber bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them paths into the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig oversees the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with the industry and gain experience."
"At the same time, VW can get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and think about who would be eligible as an employee."
Such cooperation, Selle said, is not uncommon.
What is new is that it is so offensive about the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a wide range of applicants.
But they have to praise themselves and especially focus on highly skilled workers.
In particular, graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineers remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even greater, according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes on the talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt in which the participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
As the high potentials at the universities are hopping and piercing, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
“We want to stand out from the crowd with the race.”
“Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us.”
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to be up.
"We have been in contact with all participants of a similar action over the past year.
“Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon,” he says.
In addition to the direct bulling on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies also go to the game at professional fairs.
"We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Approximately at the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, HR manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
He knows the problem of young people.
There are currently 35 jobs advertised on the company’s website.
"It's very difficult to occupy vacant positions right now."
“It takes a lot of time and money,” she says.
Another way is by contacting the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give evidence that you can do internships or write your diploma thesis with us."
Expensive promotions are not required at the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
“A large corporation can often not offer that,” says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute draws up an annual leaderboard for German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff Manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also bring advantages to job seekers.
“I think applicants are particularly looking for external assessments about a potential employer,” she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers on more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees,” he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within your own workforce.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances on their own.
“It’s like playing with gangs,” Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
A similar ban has been imposed by the government in Washington – and thus definitively revoked its previous plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Those who are responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf have not yet been definitively clarified.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is expected to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, several oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe.
At present, the competent control authority, which was disputed after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that he will close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry now publicly warns that the production volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brakes on the growth of the oil and gas industry," according to a recent industry survey by BDO's advisory firm - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows what exactly will change with regulation.”
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of litres of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live by theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari is good.
“Don’t worry,” the eco-activist reassured the journalists: “You will still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today.”
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been following an attempt to shoot a boy wading to the chest in the water with the strings surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water shine, the scene looks almost pretty.
The fact that brown crude oil swaths float under the surface is not visible.
She used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, huge amounts of crude oil poured out of a burst pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the way through the mangrove swamps traversed by rivers, the entire extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat rolls up brown broth, who dips his hand into the water, pulls oily fingers out.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black licorice sticks from the ground, sadly leaving the palms hanging out.
Swarms of birds, as they are otherwise common in wetlands, are in vain: as soon as the outboard is silent, ghostly calmness spreads in the former paradise that smells like a gas station.
“What happens here is ecological warfare,” says Celestine Akpobari darkly, “we are in constant danger to health.”
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been contested for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe invaded here, in the 1980s, the first resistance organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is denied the return to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped every day from the entire delta region, which is three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are broken and the situation is unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" the heads of the drill holes are called far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Time and again, such a drill head break apart, Akpobari says, then a constant stream of crude oil pours into the water.
More than two billion litres have flowed into the delta’s ecosystem in 50 years, according to experts: year after year, the amount of oil that spilled into the ocean off Alaska 21 years ago in the case of the Exxon Valdez supertanker – one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU is disputed about it.
While the Shell Group sabotage and organized oil theft accounts for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see bursting drillheads and licking pipelines as the main contributors.
Shell imposed much lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the Group in 2008: the rate of defects in the lines alone is "many times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-smeared workshop in the open air, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are naked and oil-smeared to the neck.
Among one of the many barrels, which are partly connected to tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later drips out at the end of the line, and finally diesel.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel per day: "That brings us 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price of just under 40 euro cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" tapping the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts in the Niger Delta, at least 16 million litres of crude oil are lost every day.
However, only a small portion of the provisionally intermediate raw material is being processed illegally: organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion’s share in tankers and swirl it into the world market.
The debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is due more to the activities of the population or the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
Meanwhile, the Ogoni’s relationship with Shell was so devastated that only a deduction from the Group would be in question: “Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese will turn out to be better.”
Michael gets nervous.
"It's the best time you're gone," says the muscular oil man.
“The soldiers can come every minute.”
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want to benefit from the raw material, like all Nigerians.
“This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way,” Akpobari says.
Investigators Discover Dangerous Construction Mistakes in A380 Engines
The A380 seems to have a big security problem.
Investigators have discovered during the investigation of an emergency landing machine a possible construction defect that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas has filed a lawsuit against the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas plane landed in the beginning of November apparently had much more luck than previously known: The Australian Air Security Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: an oil hose connection could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB authority said in a statement published this Thursday.
This could have resulted in “a catastrophic engine failure.”
Rolls-Royce produced engines in 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a lawsuit with an Australian federal court in Sydney, allowing him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline would charge compensation for the incident in early November.
When the engine burned, parts were loosened and the wings were damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue was considered sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its 11 A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine with an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Countrywide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany in white: Overnight snow fell almost all over the country.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: At icy temperatures, almost the entire republic is snowing on Thursdays at night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and east are some 15 centimeters thick snow blankets.
On several highways and many roads, traffic is severely restricted.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous operation, but was not done with the constantly new snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept across the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal level.
In Saxony, the snow drifts on the highways and federal roads led to considerable problems.
According to the severe weather center Meteomedia, therefore, the alarm stage was called violet in Saxony-Switzerland - the highest level ever.
Partly 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused turnovers.
There were several trucks and cars stuck in the night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities reported major disruptions on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stagnant traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or destroyed overhead lines and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be discontinued.
In the Thuringian Saalfeld, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were supplied by firefighters and rescuers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept over the roads.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight failures.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman of the Air Information Centre, a number of cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
Winter service is in continuous operation.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still almost 400 field beds available for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died during a collision with a train on a railway crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-capped roads: Here, too, a truck was caught on a railway crossing because the vehicle remained stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after hitting a smooth road with her car near Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will swirl even in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters pretty: the twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to recover the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
Reasons for the planned sale were not mentioned by the spokesman.
“We always check if it makes more sense to own or sell real estate on your own and then go back,” he said.
Germany’s largest credit institution is thus releasing its headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently refurbished them extensively.
According to data, the energy conversion consumed around 200 million euros.
A sale would bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers that have since been renamed "Green Towers" to around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands of people mourning their dead mates
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were spilled underground.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft, but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue personnel were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddy.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now family and friends remembered the dead with a memorial.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered in the bright sunshine in Greymouth on the New Zealand South Island.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the spilled miners, there were 29 tables with helmets, lamps and the names of the friends.
Pictures and personal items, including garments and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags flew on half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the commemoration.
“But they never came home.”
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was spilled in the pit.
In addition to the prime minister and members of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the commemoration.
During the first explosion on 19 November, miners of British and South African origin were also spilled.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, police president Gary Knowles told journalists.
To hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit in with the art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-examines old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
Which audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents in series with almost superhuman forces - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabiate killing methods and his enemies already have the guts out of the lively body when he rips a labyrinth.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, says the whole film about no word, and the other characters can be ripped up to one or two sentences or a few agonizing death screams.
Otherwise, you will be silenced and swallowed up in the spooky beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for adult cineasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
If a movie has multiple target groups, it’s only a shame if they exclude each other.
Since his wild and stylish drug dealer trilogy "Pusher" director Winding Refn is considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but Stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the arthouse with a little more humour or a little less brutality.
Most art cinema friends are likely to let themselves be deterred by the splashing brain mass and intestines.
The action fans die at the latest of boredom when eyewitnesses, for freely interpretable reasons, travel to Jerusalem via ship with a troop of violent Christian missionaries and are stuck in futility for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and remains silent there.
No wonder that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty facade there is sometimes an exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it’s all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no escape from it for the spectator.
Refn gives him barely a moment of relaxation and slowly throats his throat with his icy images and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, loyal to one eye, preserves something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means destruction, but perhaps only for those who are already corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The nuclear agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country refuses to take a position on this - nor does it allow controls.
By midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighters are attacking a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the next larger city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the quad with the help of North Korea, hidden in a valley that is draining from the electricity.
According to a briefing by the U.S. intelligence agency CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known under the name of the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology of the fifties is hardly suitable.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, she dazzled in where the components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also presented photos showing the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was close to commissioning, they said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, hardly more is known than then, indeed the puzzles became larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite certain before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that there was “an active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "supposed reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation to be "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a high UN diplomat answered only lapidar this summer that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions.”
The Syrians hurriedly set aside the debris of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly leveled the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, via a member state, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial suppliers from the time immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed to never have run a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it – as well as the satellite images.
It also denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, said.
Thus, the investigation of the case has dragged on since June 2008 and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority", as a high Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, over which the IAEA guards.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities as key to progress in the investigation, which are supposed to be "functional" with the alleged reactor - and which still exist unlike it.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which plants are involved, nor what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, in turn derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, Isis, has identified these places and has identified a building complex at Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base – precisely with this justification, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the United States to spy on military facilities.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the US intelligence agencies.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the cuboid on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be “related to fuel production.”
However, there are “no indications of sensitive activities”, i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from it, there are plausible assumptions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces was stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants information about where the debris has gone.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive garbage storage facility, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane’s Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria carried out earthworks in the three suspect locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This can be coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to keep any military secrets – just the effort shows how great the inspectors’ interest is.
However, Damascus also rejected this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna calmed down just a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter had no high urgency, for example, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing so-called special inspections into play for a few months, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna Atomic Energy Agency has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this way: firstly, it takes a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented there are anything but expecting an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat says, "What if they don't find anything at all?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still unnamed directorial debut this summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
We don’t know much about it, but that’s enough for restlessness.
The rumor is that the woman, a Muslim woman, falls in love with her Serbian rapists during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women’s associations immediately protested, and some of the shooting days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR to Jolie, demanding a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is ambassador to the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
According to the UN Refugee Agency, her organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which was given to read her script, has granted a filming license for Sarajevo after some time - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author herself asserts that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
In terms of content, however, it remains vague.
A second synopsis of the film circulates on the net, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other before the outbreak of the war and met again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, was abducted to a Serbian camp where he worked as a guard.
What sounds very different to the variant "rape victims are crushed into torture slaves".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that's for sure.
The pressure on her, Jolie said, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give you peace: by putting the script on the internet illegally, as so many have done before.
Nothing like out of here
This evening, things are finally going well for the Irish.
No trace of sadness.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans shout with joy at loud music, they stamp their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, southern Ireland, trembles as players throw table tennis balls into beer mugs over a three-metre distance – and hit them.
“Bierpong” is called the bizarre spectacle, to win there are 500 Euro victory award plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, that doesn’t really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself, distracting himself from the boring question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to have fun playing in Las Vegas, he will have interviews in New Zealand in January.
“I have a horrible feeling,” he says.
“It’s so far from home and I don’t have a job there.”
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a ruck, her desired job as event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: as with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, according to experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they are expecting 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a severe loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that in which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, now Tristesse is again spreading.
The economic crisis is especially troubling the young, well-educated Irish people, for whom it has only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the booming years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times, there are plenty of letters of readers from young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the drain in Ireland."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but who can go away and our country loses an entire generation.”
“The last one, please turn off the light.”
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future, because the government is only doing wizardry and no longer offers the young people any prospects for the future.
“They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students hang from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is having to emigrate herself in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon are trying to get a positive look at the subject.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on working abroad.
"For beginners, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website show photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O’Donovan has known what it feels like to build somewhere else for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen they are raising a fashion house.
In January, we will move on to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
In the meantime, O’Donovan rarely sees his home because he takes extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
"The situation is a bit crazy," he says, as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’ve almost never been.”
He laughs a little and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit-funded.
“It was crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Is he afraid that the loan might go wrong?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have any children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation he hears often at the moment.
“No one needs to starve – our situation is far from as dramatic as it was here on the island in the past,” he says.
"Working abroad for a while isn't the worst thing that can happen - maybe that's what makes us feel like Irish."
He laughs and then tells of his father who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just see how it goes with life somewhere else.
He has been working in London for a few years and why shouldn’t things go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one more thing that really worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could turn into a farewell party.
“Don’t blow too many emotions,” he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
“Goodbye, that sounds scary.”
"Let's call it a walk-away party, relaxed, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is getting stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These findings came from the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year’s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and second, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of proponents of democracy rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since last year’s sharp downturn, such a trend can be seen.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the most populous countries in the region, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country’s democratic practice, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% trust their government, both of which correspond to last year’s, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America’s economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
This may be due to the fact that the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and quickly recovered.
In addition, the poor were accommodated by a stronger social network.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and fell by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread thought of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
It is only for the second time since the start of the survey that many respondents in Latin America see a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member were victims of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the values have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The increase in economic performance is reflected in the increased support of the private and market economies: about 71% of respondents across the region indicated that the private sector was indispensable for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see diagram 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year), Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most Central American countries, on the other hand, see the U.S. as the most influential country, with this role being taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An electoral ladder
No one expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of electoral workers who rushed to the devastated country to help.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballots in the Rinnstein, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Electoral centers opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless as a result of the January earthquake, roamed in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected leaders, demanded the cancellation of election results due to an alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, described the election “as quite good in many respects.”
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, “these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The expected election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no approval from the voters, declares the electoral authority the winner of the run-off election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting due to a lack of organisation.
Shortly before the start of the election, about 250,000 ID cards needed for the election have not yet been distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks following her husband’s sudden death, Argentina’s president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed her popularity rate up 20 points to over 50%, the highest score since her election in 2007.
However, whether this will help her to re-elect next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who guided economic policy even after his wife was elected, often drafted budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided and Kirchner’s death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further ruptures.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian slapped another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
“I’m not going to discuss it,” the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, giving the president even more opportunity to spend money at his own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the trade unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction his main goals, not the inflation cut.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and cleaned the National Institute for Statistics and Census INDEC, which then excelled in official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called on the private sector and trade union leaders to talk.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
However, inflation undermined the growth spurt due to a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect with the rest of the world financially.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country’s previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now, Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the Paris Club donors, to whom she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of her term of office, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which for the most part has had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been shown to them will be swept away.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether she quietly repeals many of her husband’s political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan’s voters are slowly drawing closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all voters, made their way to elect mayors and city councillors in the five districts, which is considered a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the establishment of groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority vote.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates Taiwan’s greater independence, received nearly 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have been a problem for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into town councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual occurrences in Taiwan occurred, such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-swinging mass parades and sparsely dressed dancers.
There was even the compulsory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face, Lien was wounded and a nearby spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear if the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack has hampered the election and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing in the foreground.
But this time, the DPP also avoided stirring up the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It responded to the new awareness that Taiwan’s economy could not survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of attracting Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, but the most important thing first.
It would be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s rule, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP fights for the voices of the working people and the youth.
Tsai found great approval as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that she too is able to build close ties with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a forge of ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China.
Tsai publicly stated that her party is offering a “trusted alternative” to Mas’s rush toward China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he stated that the DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan’s independence.
He even urged pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen’s interference, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its potential candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Mas values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gaps between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong prevalence of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only partially in favour of a re-approach.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, “there is already no return.”
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you act at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony, and the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was over-nominated for this year’s Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since their 2008 album "Esperanza", the nomination seems a bit unusual, but it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have published no more than three albums before the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with her vibrant voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can easily be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of Spalding's nomination comes closest.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category of instrumental albums.
Iyer’s competitors include “Moody 4B” by experienced saxophonist James Moody and “Positootly” by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a robbery favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme", was awarded in the category of Contemporary Jazz, which otherwise tends to include albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category of large group. He thus competes against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example of a bassist as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", which was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical music producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati's" performed by various artists;
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the Deutsche Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre of Wales; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivan's" were nominated by the National Orchestra.
As composers, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt’s Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4 by the L.A. Philharmonic under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the instrumental solo with orchestra category.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
“I’ve used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms,” Dorman said in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinski’s works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Instrumental soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson nominated.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Exactx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Classical Crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Mosque in Temecula gains approval from planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was agreed unanimously by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
“The project is supported by many good people – Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others,” said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley.
“As an American, it makes me proud.”
“It shows that justice reigns.”
“There are few opponents,” he added.
"They're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The session began at 18:00 and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with votes distributed fairly evenly on both sides, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper’s website.
“There is no America anymore,” he said.
“It’s another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand.”
“America is at an end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for nonviolence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the camp they rented together with a water filter manufacturer.
The new mosque, about 2,300 m2 in Mediterranean style, is supposed to have two minarets and will be about 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could enable new forms of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien bacterial species that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
“This organism has two options.”
"He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"This makes it very special, although it's almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will appear Thursday in the online issue of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital – carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in Mono Lake in California continues to grow even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
“You’re wondering what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar, co-author of the Arizona State University report.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were disclosed gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon from NASA’s Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake due to its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both could potentially replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so big that arsenic works differently than phosphorus, it gets into our biochemical system, where it smears almost everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic.
The microbe grows better in phosphorus, but that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based lifeform can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon on which arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new, but so far there hasn’t been a working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth Age," said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibit dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibit dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s statement on Thursday.
The four exhibit dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, where the animals were housed in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were spotted on Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday evening, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are well," Whitmore said.
“You are in good condition.”
“They were returned to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore did not provide any detailed information about the dog’s location or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigation is still ongoing.”
“We don’t want to say anything else,” Whitmore said.
“We’re following some traces.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were uninjured, according to authorities.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the nearly one-month tour of the couple from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thicker Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue about the corgis a finder's wage, and the animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder’s wage was being paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the “prepared” credit plan to pay off $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday’s statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so that the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, will no longer stand in the way of anything.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 does not actually come into effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself raises $75 million, is leading the company, with funding expected to close by mid-December.
Restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to help investment bank Moelis & Co, the management that struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year to solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper’s efforts to solve MGM’s financial worries and pay off the studio’s more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started again when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month to run the company, receives a “success bonus” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to be released in cinemas in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio requires a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial contribution to these two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any results.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year’s favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can tear a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game equals about 10 classic jump ropes or about 48 cans of play-doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers – a Wal-Mart, a Toys “R” Us and a BJ’s Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore’s law had come into effect, and this year the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, the most well-known of their kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, has a wider offering.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not stated otherwise, all prices are from Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs, who sing a note when pressing on their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you have started pressing, you can no longer stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchangeable games like 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinge feet with wheel blocking, it masters the Moon Walk.
Children who tested the device used Mickey as a dance instructor, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now he’s back (Hasbro/Playschool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a classroom lesson, with an expert with auto-correction function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard, but the games on it are not as educational as the ones on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a match box and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy shops alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
For example, to give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figurine pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) containing a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle fabric.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children over 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of clods.
And he endures a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived for some time in our dog's mouth.
Police operations in China are becoming softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, giving orders with military authority and muted voice.
He wanted his female members of Chengguan – China’s robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and their propensity to violence – to impress viewers.
"Just standing!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely out of teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-and-white stripes.
"For me, they look average," says Mr. Tang.
“Models are pretty.”
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China’s city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled an improperly positioned snack car and stared at the operator until after half an hour he packed up and left the place.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to radically change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have reinforced the urban police strips. They have been specially selected because of their appearance, good figure and youth.
They should give the coarse police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so, the critics.
Unlike the police, these officials are only allowed to enforce urban laws with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a viewer to death when he filmed them with his cell phone as they smashed a protest action against a garbage dump.
Last year, a training manual of Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet, describing how offenders can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a handshake with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street traffickers.
“Chengguan scares the government,” lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy regarding tactics.
The newspaper called for “really thorough cleansing.”
Skeptics consider the current approach to be clearly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits via advertisements in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News asked whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as optical distractions.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 with good figure and "harmonic facial features" were searched.
They should be above average size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends at the age of 26.
According to officials, the work for women over 25 is physically too exhausting.
“The most important thing is their image,” an unnamed district official told the government website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job first depends on their external appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities".
“Female Chengguan are like flower vases,” he said, adding, “but beyond that they have other duties.”
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the District Municipality, does not agree with this description.
But admitted that in China, size specifications in job advertisements are not uncommon for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lame or buckligen here," says Mr. Zheng.
“Your image wouldn’t be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols on Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, has apple pies and a well-shaped mouth.
She doesn’t feel like she’s sexist, so much emphasis is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, “We have the task of representing the image of the city.”
According to them, they don’t regret the short-term hiring because they have more ambitious career plans than just swaying traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the strip deals with about twelve street dealers who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bike before they are driven away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We have told you this so many times!" explains Frl. Xu to a merchant who had fled on foot and had temporarily abandoned his noodle kitchen attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's almost the same every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"Everything routine."
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of merchants, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten offenders by reporting them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public animosity, which officials in China are often exposed to.
That year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly incident, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such riots.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired against regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner screamed Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male stripe coordinator, stayed behind, turning his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like her colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we do it verbally.”
"Sometimes, but also physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
“Most of the time, people start fighting.”
Prosecutor will not accuse Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Department of Justice acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges raised against him following his affair with a former electoral assistant and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious lawsuit against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada, and until the scandal that made headlines nationwide and dampened his career, he was considered a potential Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign’s office announced, he was “highly pleased” with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate ethics committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign’s lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been discontinued and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, and in their opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the presumption that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral assistants, to buy his silence over an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasurer during an election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton to work, and according to the records and interrogations, he took over lobbying for her after hiring Hampton.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign's electoral team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on rotating door lobbying.
According to the published evidence, “it seems to be an agreement and a violation of the rotary door statutes,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially declined to disclose the reasons for the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the ministry seemed very cautious in picking up political charges after a variety of defeats pursued with great interest by the media, including last year’s decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
Prosecutors “are obviously horrible,” said Melanie Sloan, chairman of the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington (an organization aimed at fighting corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
“This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, telling him that the ministry would not bring any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign’s defenders had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had “acted in accordance with the law.”
Mr. Coggins declined to explain the legal arguments he had put forward to the prosecutors in more detail.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of the conversation between the Department of Justice and me, just so much to say: we think we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop the investigation for a separate lawsuit by the Ethics Group, according to which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated the Federal Election Act.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that supported the senator for a long time, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found work thanks to Mr. Ensign’s help in lobbying.
An e-mail dated December 2008 shows that after the company moved Mr. Hampton on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had an interview with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he was "knocking" at the Interior Ministry for a matter.
Mr. Ensign was also meeting with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch, and asked the Transportation Minister to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying.
Last year, when information about this affair first penetrated to the public, Mr. Ensign apologized to his voters and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican ranking.
After noticing him for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his press spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes that the Ethics Commission will follow the example of the Department of Justice very quickly and stop his investigations.
“Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work at the service of the people of Nevada,” she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the riots in the courtroom.
Within minutes, they sent their reports of horrible testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and bed-chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the carefully prosecuted trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will come to an official end when the judgement on the death sentence pronounced by the jury falls.
But Mr. Haye’s lawyers have already filed applications with the court, explaining the reasons for an appeal and which the courts will deal with for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process – including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters – has led to a “circus atmosphere” and such widespread, immediate penetration of riotous details, so that the jury has been inadvertently influenced by public outrage.
This objection could lead the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies will make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
“Just as I experienced it during this process, I believe it’s really a danger if the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects everyone’s right to a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Haye’s chief defense attorney.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Chamber Court, dismissed the motions briefly and unanimously last week when he said that the New Media would be “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the sentence against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who allegedly killed his wife, saying in his decision that there had been a “carnival atmosphere in the courtroom” because of the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court appeals that consider Mr. Haye's conviction a half-century later may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the ways of communication from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in trials pursued by a broad public," said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has investigated the death penalty in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many that Mr. Hayes’ lawyers present to discuss for years, thus delaying a conviction.
The defenders also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been prejudged when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them horrible scene pictures during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their breeders, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, would have filled them with disgust.
The defenders say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, arguing that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the public prosecutor’s office, and that he would have impermissibly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The judges were not isolated.
But her arguments about the impact of detailed reporting on the process may attract the greatest interest.
In a verdict they filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was debated by the candidates during the campaign for governorship and for the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotion over the case.
“Such a daily rush of media whistleblowers, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom,” the lawyers wrote, “hasn’t been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide.”
Their focus on Twitter reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages are more inciting than reports that are being reimbursed more slowly was a technology-violence look that deprived the coverage of future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals courts are often confronted with the argument that social and technical changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966, in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard for reporting was lifted and made it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
“This case,” they wrote, “represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century.”
Can politeness connect the breakup?
After a campaign of infamy and negativity, little politeness broke out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of genuine two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before one quickly returns to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders did not bring a breakthrough in the big issues that were addressed during the so-called “lame duck session,” the session at the end of a period of government in which decisions are no longer taken.
After all you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides or a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan point-gathering.
The public meeting of the President’s Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that persist between the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise is demanded, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is about taxes, donations, health or expectations, the two sides are miles away from each other.
Last but not least, the November elections in Washington voted mildly for at least a short time.
“No question, the tone has changed,” said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration, who is now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“This is inevitable after the elections.
Elections evoke partisan passions that die again.
And that's good."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the “lame duck session,” Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all, be it temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich while denying support to unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, the optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
“After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation,” he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that politeness leads to true cooperation.
“I see a lot of what is happening from today until 2012, as a pre-fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012,” he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who have served their formation.
As concerned as Republican leaders may be that they are playing poker too high, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and override health reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice-Chairman Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own estimation, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation and they are struggling very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance can be found in the elected representatives of the panel, as there is little room for compromise in financial matters, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first battle will take place next year in the form of party clashes when Republicans challenge Obama on the state budget, taxation, and health care system, followed later by a phase of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to a dead end, as it did in 1995, then both parties must pay close attention to the public response.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Particularity and polarization are bigger today than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and Congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
From this point of view, the courtesy displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that continue to separate the two.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "cleptocracy" and it passes on some of the bribes and protections it collects to the Kremlin, as reported in February by the American Embassy in Russia in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service extort high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy – what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “verticals of authority” – takes its share of the money that the ladders are moving upwards.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on his homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow’s mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that he had been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous libel charges against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: “It’s crazy, it’s dirty, it’s dirty.”
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is uncommon for individuals to be named, as in the Ambassador’s report, and it is unheard of that to be done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
“The direct link between the Moscow government and crime has led some to call it ‘disturbed’ and conclude that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a government,” the memo said.
Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection) that extends through the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Inspectorate (MVD) and the Public Prosecutor's Office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov is at the top."
“FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage.”
“Recently, ordinary criminals and criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level.”
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help.”
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, “explained that Moscow’s business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as before.”
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The message memo contains descriptions of men who go to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
“It’s not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American embassy, which took place late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that it solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted indignantly to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth is that it’s about our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest, we didn’t expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge Veterans Forced to Confront the Past
In a poorly illuminated, concreted classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built him, of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and he took care of his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher", the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to face the public with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian community tribunal first sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge to 35 years in prison when it sentenced former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making their efforts to reconcile and re-integrate into Cambodia’s society more difficult.
“There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything,” said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia’s documentation center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“It divides families.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of illness, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and the Pol Pot-Ied government overthrew in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread unrest here until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok moved up to the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country’s first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to run over to government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting trial.
When their patrons stopped protecting them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
“These people have benefited very little from the surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
“They are anchored in the regime’s utopian agricultural ideology.”
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who had joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
“Life under the Khmer Rouge was good,” he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife to court, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to alleviate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told representatives of the Cambodian Documentation Center that she was in charge of the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers were believed to have died.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun threw long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court were to charge more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand everything.”
The center created the first government-approved schoolbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Department of Education’s history book, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
How often in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read.
“My family rejects many parts of the book and the court,” he said.
“They’re suspicious because they’re not sure how many people are being convicted by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court are gradually gaining influence,” he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown with shrubs and soiled with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone saleswoman on the roadside, said she didn’t know much about the man who had been burned here.
“But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray,” she said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot’s last resting place, where she will lay down a bush of ripe bananas – in the hope that he will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to stop accumulating weapons-capable uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article from the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to persuade Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements have been made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapon-capable uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material – according to an official employee, who remains anonymous due to the topic’s sensitivity, about 500 pounds.
The deal appears to be one of the key findings of Obama’s “47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit” in April, which ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat in the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves to me that it works,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear safety group.
Clinton called the deal “a very important, important step” by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama’s nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapon-capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“This is our raw material... we won’t make dirty bombs out of it and we won’t sell it to anyone.”
“We only use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago when it indicated an interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that took more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second run was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
“This was extremely cautiously coordinated and coordinated to build trust,” which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on Global Danger Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Publication Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapon-capable uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly fortified uranium.
According to the joint agreement, Belarus wants to dismantle its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been tense for years, primarily because of Lukashenko’s harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens,” she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents disclosed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper “El Pas” (by cable) and it is added that the former Deputy Head of Government Maria Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed “to prove that foreign planes flying over Spain are adequately monitored.”
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe in which aid to human rights-defying practices was indicted in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the report of the Council "has taken Zapatero aside" and reiterated that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
“De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objections to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory.”
"You just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ingel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government “does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because it is in the hands of the judges.”
In January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González told the embassy that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of documents from the Spanish Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Secretary of Defense via the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador said after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discretely handle between governments,” Aguirre said.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely concerned about their independence and do what they think is appropriate," he had instructed his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments to make the tension flare."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to the matter.
“Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the government has tolerated or deliberately ignored Zapatero’s actions that could be construed as potential human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the government of the United States,” he stresses.
The child murderer admitted that she had complained on the internet about the “tribulation” of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this nickname, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend, both of whom are from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruna, where she was born.
The announcements are from 2008.
To understand these, you need to know their love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman began a relationship with Iván Táez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and sour because I came here to work."
“When I told him that, he liked it, but now of course he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and leave what he wants.”
Later, she mentions a message she just received on the phone: “I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy.”
She complains, “If he doesn’t like me leaving the boy with my mother, I’ll pick him up when I’m back.”
In May, she spoke of returning to her village: “This week I am going there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to imagine myself working on the 20th if I don’t want to lose it.”
She explains that she takes her firstborn with her if everything goes well.
"He'll be with whoever he has to be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother," a dubious intent, considering their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not."
“On the one hand, he’s with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other he has to go to school every day.”
She is talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer class, so I have less expenses for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A giant kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he emailed me some videos. You see, if he wants, he finds me, such a crap."
On the 30th, one more thing: "The boy is fine. He goes to a summer class to learn Catalan."
There’s one from her current partner, Victor: “He’s shooting me money.”
On the internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now blocked, in which she called herself "Muki, the prison releaser."
"Terror a la gallega (headline)".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting overseer, declares to be offended because he feels guilty.
He can’t believe it all happened because she hadn’t told him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners in Menorca to the provincial prison of Palma.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
However, she had previously confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and hiding his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of November 28, PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing its gaze on parliamentary elections - preferentially or not - and its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this ascending trend – resulting from the PSC’s diversion of votes and the PP’s ties – should continue, PP analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while also CiU would win four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (out of 25) MPs.
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People’s Party’s analysis, the ERC would lose one MP – currently it has three – while ICV could hold its MP or win one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will be May 2011. Even then, the People’s Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist dominance, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the city councils with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People’s Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists can neither gain a majority nor resort to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
According to the Republican debacle, it is not wrong for this party to lose its representation in the city council of Barcelona, where it would have to score 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the leading role in Tarragona’s turnaround, where they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
En Lérida's PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last campaign they met several times.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party recorded a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell bought Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by police officers from the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the various Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement to Liberate Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the assassination attempt in Bombay.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, which he goes so far as to assure that “Operation Kampai” has “weakened” the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaida worldwide and “so their ability to act”.
The researchers assume that during the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe, which is why, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have been involved in the investigations. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks in the territory of the EU in the next few days as the one carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade) another one was carried out in Thailand, where the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Buttikad were arrested.
They had led the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it had been destroyed in 2009 - in particular stole tourist passports according to the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents were issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 years and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In investigative circles it is underlined that until now no links between the detainees in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay have been detected, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent out by means of a money transfer company, which had been "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police seized extensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to postpone the tax agreement
The president of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present Artur Mas’s terms in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are no different from those already presented during the election campaign and can be combined with the priority of the economic recovery and the failure of his regionalist independence adventures to propose a high-level financial settlement agreement.
The president of the Catalan People’s Party turned to Artur Mas with the certainty that the 18 members she won last Sunday - a figure that is more than sufficient to feel indispensable - because the candidate from the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU relies on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from voting when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP, but the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the PPC leader is concerned, the PPC demands that in support of the inauguration “all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia” as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region – similar to the Basque country – which the party leader of CiU even wants to submit to a referendum be put to the back.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for the inauguration of Mas are dealt with by PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV), today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home confirms that the deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the Olot elderly home do not rule out the fact that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
The officials of the elderly nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they highlighted the harm caused by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible - to the institution during his work.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Caada, announcing, "La Caritat wants to accuse the person responsible (for the deaths) but "the law and our liability compel us to accept the trial and civil liability".
The institution not only has to accept a loss of social standing because it had not established the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pays a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies – former patients of the elderly care home – as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities due to their age and diseases were handled by telephone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point altogether, stating that "lack of action could never have been the reason for the incidents."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “there is no evidence of negligence by any person other than the accused in the litigation.”
He confessed eleven murders yesterday and declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and that one and a half months later the second old lady had been murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of different sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said the staff’s access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and sedative cocktail in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory tests will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it from the inside by administering bleach to them, as he confessed he had done to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, people don’t believe the nurse’s statements, not even the number of murders that could be more, justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it doesn’t make sense to change his course of action after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
The European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors responded sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.”
The risk premiums of the euro peripheral countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and that the euro has barely increased in points, which is a cause for concern.
Yesterday’s events are typical of an illiquid market that is recovering to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several times in the future.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to purchase public debts, as they were ineffective, as well as the lifting of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended “at least until March” and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the quarterly end to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect the program of buying bonds to continue and send a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent response of yesterday’s markets will be thrown back, and if it is half-heartedly insisted that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just like at the ECB meeting in May, where the bank reiterated that it did not consider buying sovereign debt securities and that the markets collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new market collapse.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was rather weak.
The state asset management spent only 500 million to 5.28%, compared to 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in perception of the markets in the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at around 10,000 million in the short term and possible another 15,000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the issue with the July stress tests, the numbers under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must get parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday, and as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland continues to be a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her discourse with regard to the Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, where political unity is required to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven’s ninth symphony.
The Spanish Prime Minister yesterday presented the plan of action, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Retirement reform, transparency in autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of government deficits, liberalisation, privatisation and employment measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors such as Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has grown by 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, which is why we rely on a strong demand that will eliminate any doubts about our debt restructuring capacity.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would receive liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should comply with Caesar’s wife’s motto: “Now counts not only being, but also appearance.”
Courage, we can do that!
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen contests the shareholders' meeting of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the family of Alvarez, owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not fade away.
David Alvarez, founder of the company group, will challenge the shareholders’ meeting of El Enebro, which will take place on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them “absolutely void”. His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his children Jesás David and Maria José are preparing the legal action for a new chapter in their dispute over the control of a part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not appear to be willing to give in in his dispute over the control of the institutions of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who appointed themselves as members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year, which is already registered in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro Shareholders’ Meeting, which was convened by the judge of Madrid’s Commercial Court No. 2 for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderstorm in the lap of the Alvarez family.
The invocation of the judge to convene the Assembly is the only legal way of ensuring the convocation of the Shareholders’ Assembly.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira ilvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David ilvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to have legal sensibilities, fraudulent machinations and abuse recognized the meeting of January 18," official spokespersons said.
This argument is the basis for the challenge of the assembly in retrospect to declare it "absolutely void."
The same protagonists, enveloped in discreet silence, were already unsuccessfully trying to convene a meeting by judicial means in June.
At El Enebro – an asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets – David âlvarez’s seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right of use over 51% of the capital.
This is the real background of the case on which the judge has to decide in the hearing of the appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with Siemens secret weapon
The cars are improved with real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been marked by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
At first, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last seasons, everyone bet on the victory of Fernando Alonso’s Ferrari at the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to lower the skills of German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault’s engine, the “secret weapon” that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into its hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This computer science program, referred to as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is a faithful reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of the Siemens industrial department, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - Red Bull factory "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and implement the changes and improvements that are noted on the races and in the tests.
Russwurm reports that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who could make no more than three or four improvements in a season.
Today, Red Bull’s team employs 180 highly skilled young people who use high-performance computer systems to carry out analyses and all sorts of changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager said the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull’s racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set on this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on their races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and production of its racing cars in a place 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are severely restricted.
Everything that happens is top secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the service of his participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose fame is zero.
Steve Nevey, the plant’s chief technologist, said five years ago that R&D progress for race cars contributed to the victory by 50 percent and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the pilots’ contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they “are unpredictable gladiators.”
HP to open 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated his first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network of 20 stores, each of 80 to 100 square meters, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The Company agrees on this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand sales divisions, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
As an example, the deputy chairman of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, mentioned the rebuilt store at the Gran Via in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to betray the upcoming reopenings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The deputy chairman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening a store is always the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive store equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all shops will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and emphasized that the exclusive sales outlet network intends to "optimize customer service and advice for small and micro-enterprises in purchasing and after that, even packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed especially for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their technical customer service contracts," said Helena Herroro.
Sabadell wants to 'claw' a million customers to its rival in three years
Jaime Guardiola, executive director of Banco Sabadell, is more optimistic than other managers, believing that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a fall in the interest rates that banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years – a subject that still remains.
Sabadell has found the way to exploit the next three years and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guideline in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000 if you withdraw the customers that the bank will lose - which is the big challenge that this bank faces, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has acquired 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Their market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while their business accounts for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges that the bank is facing will be presented together with the annual financial report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has disrupted all of the banks’ plans worldwide.
This year, Sabadell will finalize its Optima Guideline, which was initially designed to last three years, but was extended by one fiscal year as a result of the market situation.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with a long reach".
The manager assumes that Spain would only come out of the crisis “slowly”.
In addition, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if it assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalises interest margins - will diminish, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will already be diverted to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are structural and they will put pressure on the loans.”
“We didn’t turn off the cock, but the interest rate differentials are very high,” Guardiola admitted.
On Thursday, Banesto issued an order to its branch network to restrict the allocation of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Dias of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also acknowledged that banks are currently pursuing the policy of "increasing fees" but "within a competitive framework".
Sabadell’s guiding plan is based on organic growth, even if, as always, the group does not exclude corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
“Everything will change next year,” he said.
He stresses that the demand for capital is currently "growing enormously" and does not rule out the fact that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market in the case of capital stocks.
After reassuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he dismisses the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be brought into circulation, but unlike the incidents in June, short-term financing can be achieved through repo transactions and thus intercept the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of savings banks
CECA Director-General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a fusion of savings banks and stressed the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the Spanish savings banks’ concentration process began, several savings banks insisted not to participate in the first phase.
On the other hand, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Bank Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Civica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was rather adjustments."
"Most of it is complete. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeen, but all the important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Spain, which has strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process "was completed as quickly as possible and that we need to be satisfied with the timely process that was established in the past, not now, as part of the business plans with Banco de Espana", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger than we have met the Basel Agreement," he emphasized.
Olavarrieta stated that "there are a number of unresolved opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed uncertainty and nonsense," because "Banco de Spain urges us to conclude in due time before the end of the year."
The Director General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and “perhaps” in the whole world, adding that those who doubted did so “without deeper knowledge”.
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we need not worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have undergone a “very significant” concentration process that will be carried out “as soon as possible.”
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July very well.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has chosen to maintain the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the entire European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies, the lifting of the €426 support for unemployed people who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, Deputy Prime Minister Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, who has summoned the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It should be anticipated that Merkel’s position is not a mistake of her public relations work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany takes a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the preservation of the traditional traditions of most of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the German mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large part of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a change in the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that violate the requirements; the possible suspension of payments in some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been showing up for some time, so there are no excuses now.
At first, in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first indication of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country when Merkel painfully delayed the decision to save Greece.
This was strongly criticised at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion were absolutely against saving Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel comes out with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union’s agreements in order to enable the rescue of a country and at the same time to oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was construed as anti-European because it pushed the Irish crisis and all the following.
But their proposal, although sweetened, has been adopted, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross it.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures have to be taken now - from this date onwards the old functioning of the euro will no longer exist.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which the violating countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent, and in which case the private sector will have to bear part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would be bad at not understanding it.
It is not just about reducing the government deficit to 3% by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will turn into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities we are offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero has understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own home has prepared its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn’t seem that something would change.
Among the possibilities that have been considered is that we would have to leave the euro area, which is full of less reputable countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it had warned us.
Sport and circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The supposedly instigated exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against the Ajax in the Champions League resulted in a lot of ink being shed on whether it was an unsportsmanlike act or not and whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league match against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club’s coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed rules in this sport.
Part of the debate about the case presented goes back to the fact that a team of football club Real Madrid (who in his anthem showed nobility and honor and on other occasions punished his players for similar incidents) played the lead role in the game, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history than a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate is about whether this behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions constitute a rule-bypass; in fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this case, the damage caused to the sporting spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from taking an unjustified advantage from the counter-team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we normally mean by cheating or bypassing rules, because the circumvention of the rule has not been carried out in secret to avoid a penalty, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders pulled out of the intentional foul.
It should be pointed out that the rival was not placed in a less favourable position, nor were advantages for the game being played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain extent uncertain advantage, as the team could eventually also leave. In addition, with this procedure, players receive a penalty and move into the second card cycle, in which they leave because of card accumulation with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether this is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such approaches are not directed against the sporting spirit, which includes strategic decisions in order to take the greatest possible benefit from the regulations.
In this case, players didn’t want to circumvent a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule-bypass), they were more likely to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or escaping a punishment.
Although the line between inventiveness and rule environment is blurred, I believe this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer-Offensive for Group Christmas Dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar drops an avalanche of reservations this year on the days of 16 and 17 December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, during the pre-Christmas season, there are also group dinners that supply oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry in Barcelona, but as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which is the big crowd: Almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) dropped all orders into the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have discontinued group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to give up this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, low prices are demanded, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona Hospitality Board, Gaietá Farrás.
The representative of the umbrella association has not yet dared to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it dozens of times before reserving."
“They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices,” he emphasizes.
The business will go well with those who "offer quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, reminding us that customers will save in times of crisis, which is why prices are demanded the most by 25 euros.
In a survey in several centrally located restaurants it turns out that the evening of December 17th leads the providers to collapse.
The Soteras Group says that the demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The Group has adjusted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain last year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which heads El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, there is no loss of optimism after revenues have flourished again since the second quarter and good prospects for the Christmas business, albeit focused on a few days.
Sources of the company group emphasize that the 18th will also be an overactive day with friends groups celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added to the six group menus, giving the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than last year and want more details in return, such as Cava.
In some companies you can also see green sprouts sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are back in recovery.
On the side of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice-chairman, Enric Gomá, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "lively" overall, although the customers "do a maximum."
The fun of the party did not go down, no matter who paid.
Pakistan’s nuclear program raises major concerns in the United States
Islamabad makes nuclear weapons “faster than any other country.”
Wikileaks revelations confirm Taliban-Pakistan relations.
The content of the correspondence between the North American embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State revealed by the internet portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program Washington is raising.
On the fringe of the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of nuclear security is not strengthened, but rather “decreases”, and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons “to a faster rhythm than any other country.”
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program -- that the weapons are not assembled, but their parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack -- is preparing sleepless nights for Washington.
In a report before the visit of former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson said: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of transporting nuclear material.”
The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer only seen by the US, but also by Russia as outrageous and reason to exercise caution.
“Pakistan needs to hire strictly religious personnel to guard nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programs,” Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentary unveiled by Julian Assange’s Internet portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is declining and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing communications with Pakistan as “frustrative” said: “Often there is no transparency; we don’t get answers or they are rejected.”
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a state intelligence official for South Asia, acknowledges that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country.”
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit of Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to “clarify to the person in charge that “Pakistan’s army has to stop its tacit support of terrorist groups.”
Hunting for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a senior leader in the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol gives a red warning about the pursuit and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the issues are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a “red warning” on “finding and persecuting” Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
It’s not new, it’s from November 20.
It also has nothing to do with the last revelation of over four million U.S. diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
WikiLeaks’ lawyer Mark Stephens said: “The police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
Already on the 20th, the international police agency based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the power by the Swedish authorities.
The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and find Assange "in order to temporarily arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries, according to the organization, view the red warning as a license for arrest – which must be carried out by the national police – especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is presumably staying.
The move upset Assange’s lawyers, who posted a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
They also recall that Assange applied for the exit from Sweden and received the appropriate permission from the prosecutor, who is compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s chief of security.
“This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him - and his mother from Australia affirms her son's innocence - Assange stays in an unknown place, but not silently.
On Monday, he interviewed the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location, requesting the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, she would have to resign,” he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as “ridiculous and absurd.”
“I’m not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a high-ranking anti-terrorism leader, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations “to seize their funds and pursue anyone who supports or contributes to them.”
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be “murdered.”
“Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something.”
Who didn’t apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and potential presidential candidate.
“Whoever it was that leaked information into the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not execution is a mild punishment,” he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to secretly vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the General Assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the tenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the directionless ERC after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the electoral votes.
The party leader is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for former party leader Josep Llu’s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weak today as its mentor itself and will not cause him the same headaches as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries with a wink to win the new critics, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
Earlier today, the ERC’s over 200 regional councillors announced that they could secretly comment on his stay in office.
With ballots, not with a raised hand.
If the Carodists wanted to miss out on the presidency, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he affirmed that he would feel unconfirmed with half of the votes plus one, and he added, without specifying percentages, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
Carod's supporters demand more from the president than just making his office available to the party, an insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the supreme body of congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board on a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the Strategic Reorientation Document, which will be submitted to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós, which in return promises to move Congress to autumn 2011, which the party leaders already consider a fact.
The president of the ERC believes that the "polyphony" damages stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the current conseller Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader was supported "in exchange for different goals".
He counted five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a way of functioning.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should allow the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercós' team, who fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed with the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 quake assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is yet to come, as infogle was not advisable for the internal upheaval of recent years to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lurking, the time may have come to take up this matter again and to conclude it forever.

Next to him, the police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its targets to reduce greenhouse gases
China’s representative at COP16 said his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and would maintain its offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16, reassures.
At his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei said his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He stated that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the targets for reducing gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he emphasized that in China, the authorities of the states had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
In addition, he has carried out, initiated or completed several multi-year plans, both those financed by the Chinese government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficient Usage Program, which has been introduced over the past five years and has received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and privately held.
A provincial project on climate change is also underway, another for exchanging traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts are far greater than would be commonly believed.
He pointed out that the per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by 20 percent in the last five years and another is expected to happen by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The PAN’s national leader stated that the former Panist party leader had the right to turn to the National Order Commission and demand what the right would allow him.
The PAN’s national leader, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former PAN’s party leader had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and demand what the right granted him.
In an interview that took place before the complaints were filed by Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he said the exclusion of Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Commission of Order in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case, so that a decision is taken by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he stated, it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidates had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional emerged strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so “internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, “we enjoy it and it strengthens us,” he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the one or the best chairman that Acción Nacional would need for the next three years, so it would hand over the staff to "those whom the Council would appoint."
"I'm completely unconcerned and open, and I'd be proud to entrust each of the five with the office of party president."
He predicted that the party’s upswing recorded in the last July 4 elections would be reflected in the next elections, though “it’s not time to think about 2012.”
“Now it’s about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task.”
In this context, he underlined that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa were carrying the flag and would be observed throughout the country, which is why "many hopes and aspirations are placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is on par with the requirements."
When he was questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his disc course within the framework of his four-year reign, César Nava called on supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them if they finally come out of the closet,” he said.
He believes that the owner of the federal government expresses such expressions as the one he can make in his discourse at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no prohibition of the mouth and even less censorship.
Obama campaigns on Twitter for the law in favor of undocumented students
“If you’re in favour of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge them to pass that law,” the president tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today backed the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act – law legalizing undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
“If you’re in favour of passing the Dream Act, then call your senators and urge them to pass that law,” Obama tweeted.
His brief contains a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document that urges the public to contact their senators, including as the vote of the law is imminent.
“With your voice we’re waiting for, the time has come to listen to you,” he emphasizes.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law unless the extension of tax cuts from the Bush era and government funding would be extended.
Such a blockade announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, Presidential Spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be drawn up for the rest of the projects.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
“We all agree that the tax issue must be settled by the end of the year.”
“I believe we can make an agreement on this at any time and then we can plan the rest,” he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would “apply for the vote at the end of the debate” so that the Dream Act, which would allow the initiative to legalize undocumented students, could be voted in Senate starting next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act, or the Law of the American Dream, would legalize about 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were under sixteen years old, living in that country for the last five years, enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the advocates of the law need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense influence on the passing of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most enlisted Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe, and Susan Collins, as well as Florida Senator George Lemieux, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martinez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past include Utah-based Orrin Hatch and Texas-based Kay Bailey Hutchinson, but they said they would not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported the law, John McCain, has not yet defined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Pleasure of Language' was a walk where the participants made their way to the narrative
"I understand that with sex in language, but ... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event, she explained the round table was dedicated to sex in language).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentine writer spit sweetly towards the audience, which was mainly composed of young people who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz then described as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not answer, but receives clues for the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, but who explained to her that wound was not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "The wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs relieved and concludes that she "only learned of the wound that it is really open and does not exist", but she is convinced that the pleasure in the language and its traps are mixing.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also presented an adorable narrative, which he called 'praise of the invention', in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a turning point and told of America, the great novel, which from the beginning was not lacking in his own chroniclers, and he critiqued Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who told the stories of the prosperous.
Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told – with imagination that even the sense of shame was lost.
However, he emphasizes, "it is the madmen and liars who imagine things best," and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the “Tradition Cervantes.”
“We inherited from him what is being told.”
When it was Mayra Montero’s turn, the writer commented on and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIL’s invitation to the Round Table “The Finger in the Wound” had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that affects her country -- like all of Latin America -- as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
“I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentionally planned engagement,” she explained, after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that builds up between the author and readers as if it were a “chemical reaction.”
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero, whose contribution also included "this finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also result in dogmatisms, forgetting that “behind every confirmation there is a little ‘no’ and behind every denial a little ‘yes’.”
"To be in possession of our thoughts and of reality, we must nuance: and nuances often mean to put your finger in the wound and to harass those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in prefabricated ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful who prefer to reappear the world in black and white.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final game, two different styles are also opposed, and their encounter, marked by contrasts, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has kept himself good, which is why this opportunity is of particular importance to him.
The Argentine has made his way up to the second champion with the medal, he is one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santist strategist reached the first final as a coach at 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to face a setback again, as the game ended with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but at the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two options to insert his title, but ultimately missed the three of his steps.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival, so he doesn't want to be chased by the misfortune and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he reaffirms that the game itself is the most important thing for him.
“I want to be a champion, I don’t want to break statistics, that’s for a club, for my affection that I surrender, and that’s why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important thing,” the helmsman commented when asked about the lost finals.
"The only lesson we can learn from this is that until the referee doesn't whistle the end, we can't celebrate, we're prepared at the line, so are the players, because the last time we've been prepared to leave with two penalties, and I don't think there's a lesson to celebrate."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shooting does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to the time we have come to the nerve or the fierce striving.
It’s Romanso’s power to no longer be second champion and to taste the glory that the titles bring for the first time.
The U.S. changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Before their interview with the consulate, the persons must present themselves to the visa application services; the costs will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa will change at the Embassy of the United States and in the consulates.
In the case of the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves in the consulate at the visa application services (ASC, the initial letters in English) before their interview.
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new process has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa is reduced because it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment, processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed over.
The applicant only makes a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the counterpart to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second date for the conversation remain in the consulate there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service fee of $26.
Further information on the new visa application procedure can be found on the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American space agency called a press conference to present tomorrow a find that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) is announcing an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The finding will be presented tomorrow at a press conference in the NASA headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, a science that explores the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When the press conference was convened, NASA assured that it would present “an oversight finding for the search for extraterrestrial life,” prompting speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments that were previously considered uninhabitable, human-like creatures could exist. The hypothesis has been raised that they could turn into intelligent living beings -- like humans -- if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it is a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment considered too toxic for all conceivable forms of life, as the lake is heavily arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances are increasing that there may be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, "there is actually a different form of life, a second form of life that is different from what we know."
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its findings at the press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is investigating the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn's largest moon) on the question of whether its chemical composition resembles Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system is introduced, they lament.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition block, led by the members of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes?s Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who imagined themselves to be independent, had already been installed. The four questioned the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the introductory session to the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a “two-party system” would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political marginalization with these reforms.
He stated that they would talk to PAN and PRI representatives in the next few days to change the scheme, starting from their political will, and if they had not, they would be subjugated by both parties again, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
"Until here I come (the opposition coalition), this is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even consider taking the opinions of the others into account."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergence stated that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that the Congress, after being monopolistic, should now be “duopolitan.”
“It is not the spirit of legislative reform that Congress should have an eternal two-party system.”
"For starters, this group will start with five deputies and they will talk to other colleagues so they can become more," said the Convergence member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, in allusion to PAN and PRI, said that the congress had now turned into a ‘loot’ for two.
“Before it was only one party, now they split it up in two.”
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the deputies and to assign them their place at the negotiating tables.
"The top five decisions, which are likely to be nine MEPs, must not be ignored; the five, which are currently seen as being split into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform because of the reform that has been implemented and agreed by the others."
200 000 Peso more for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city council.
This means that the amount paid to the owner of the company in the second half of the year is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for greater transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued to an amount of 200,144,56 peso with the number 9258447 was issued last 16 November with the purpose of "billing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. She is being watched by the Auditor’s Superior del Estado for selling at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and as a result, the number of checks still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, just the debts are paid, just like the other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "shown up" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is questioned by the ASE to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the Treasurer assured her that her services would not be reused.
After the newspaper Noroeste published the checks issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it became known that from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid more than 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Touristic places need to be improved
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the overthrow of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán applied to the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada Trader Association, recalled that on different occasions, it was called for to maintain the destination and turn the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and walkways had a negative effect as the tourists came to wander and saw the clutter, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't be doing the construction work slowly and planlessly."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist’s overthrow had highlighted the city’s lack of prevention and maintenance work.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid something like this happening again. How should it do that? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration has to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Nowadays we need more than just advertising to attract tourists, we need to offer a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and keeps tourist attractions constantly on hold," he added.
“These arrangements have not been given enough attention, and these types of incidents expose what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed.”
The undersecretary of Promoción Turistica, Raul Llera Martánez, stressed the importance of saving the tourist resorts of Mazatlán, because they would not be used properly and would create a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that, together with the city, would have to be brought to the forefront.
“Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites, which must first be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism and to bring them to the inventory with which we advertise this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
President of the CCE, Eduardo Dávalos, suggested that MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
Mazatlán’s corporate sector is calling for a dignified parliament, free of any collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is upset and facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alianza, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence and one of PVEM. That makes a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel committed to society and the different social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE Coordination Council, suggested that the new MEPs should take on the great responsibility of setting an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
“We hope that MEPs really exercise their right to act freely between the parties, because it is common for them to make agreements by which they represent their own interests, transforming themselves into carnival comparses of the governors and the leaders of parliamentary factions.”
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We make sure that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, work for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, said one of the major challenges facing the 40 representatives of the people was the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will somehow promote job creation.”
With regard to the tourism industry, he called on the new MEPs to give the necessary importance to the Ministry of Tourism in the state budget.
"I have understood that it is the Ministry with the second least means, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
Tourism projects must be funded, state security must be supported and the alcohol law, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
The Holy King is sought
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family long for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
For the parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next Triking Day, because the household consists of no more than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesu, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isabelas, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no permanent work.
"Sometimes there are tough times because my husband doesn't have a job, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I'm going to the street with the gorges to sell," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has wanted to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana proposes clothes in the size for one-year-olds.
"(José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd like this monster so much,' but I replied, 'let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old Maria Guadalupe has a size of 12; ten-year-old Isabella is a size of 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is a size of 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in sizes 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is sought' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, ten searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region as part of the dismantling of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, at the sites that were said to have served predominantly for drug production.
“About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
Eleven men and three women were arrested, two of whom are from Sherbrooke.
The detainees are said to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke courthouse hours after their arrest.
They could be accused of, among other things, the production of cannabis, its possessions for sales purposes, the conspiracy, and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation activity that went on for over a year.
“The information obtained from the public has allowed us to carry out these arrests,” said Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the regional investigative unit Estrien of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be followed
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says is to settle the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is expected to be stamped out after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
“I strongly oppose this charter.”
“I stand with a party that has tied your feet,” said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus session in front of the assembled deputies.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person to be detained for up to a year by a seaship identified as the transport of illegal immigrants, violates the Canadian Constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also suggested that he could not support the bill because it was against the wrong target group.
“We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government is doing,” Duceppe said.
The criticism of Olivia Chow’s immigration issue, the NDP, has dismissed critics who claim that their party was not steadfast enough towards the secret immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is exactly what we are trying to enforce by means of another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservatives’ bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least a year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of the Canadians.
“The Canadians strongly tell the deputies that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal acts that concern Canada and that treat the country like a kick-off.”
“They expect Canada to take tough action,” Kenney said.
“The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill, which could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, one conservative told QMI that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MP would declare himself immediately to his voters.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite Jean Charest’s announcement of the creation of a new standing unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigative committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
However, Wednesday’s announcement has surprised more than one.
It must be said that, despite Robert Dutil’s presence, this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Quebec Police Service’s Standing Committee on 29 October last year.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Québécois Party, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as "a rabbit conjured from the hat" as well as "a solution made right at a table end".
Minister Dutil, for his part, had turned to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"You will see the result if we announce it," he reiterated.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
“The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and me will think he has something to hide,” he said.
"The only means of forming an investigative committee is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and policy systems at ENA.
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes to Quebec to give the audit a special mandate so that it can conduct investigations into corruption and secret agreements.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give audit control the same power as commissioners, which would also allow it to force people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be more responsive to this type of crime.
This question comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not clear in this type of law enforcement.
Vic Toews, Secretary of State for Public Security, for his part, confirmed that his colleague of the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned the groups of motorcycle police officers, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been revised.
As a result, Ottawa enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict supervision
Several rivers remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfall that has occurred in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the administrative region of Mauricie, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudere.
A road has sunk in itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall from 40 to 70 milliliters has rained on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimetres of precipitation were expected here by Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The areas north of the river and the Outaouais Valley were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérome, in the Laurentian Mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring and continue to be observed.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has resulted in the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an escape bridge was torn away due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, crossing certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and closely monitors the situation, security adviser Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec State Flood Centre, for its part, issued warnings on Wednesday of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially reprimanded
The Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Radio Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial statements on social welfare and Haitians as well as for his cumbersome speech via radio.
The CCNR believes that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinions, certain statements "have contained inaccurate information on social welfare and unjustified negative representations of Haitians, as well as such a rash manner of speech that is not appropriate for the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion about suicide, which involves the dissemination of the names of two persons who committed suicide, violates the code of broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts in 2008 and 2010.
The first order was brought as a result of a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec".
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Instead, moderators should provide sound as misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
“The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the consequences of the Dupont le midi program would have addressed a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner.”
Therefore, he was not reproached for his person.
The last issue involved the statements relating to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had a media-driven dispute in this regard, which had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he did not donate in favor of Haiti aid, since one would not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustified negative representation of Haitians.
"I have already dropped my three-day suspension penalty in this matter."
“My file has been virgin for a year and a half,” the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board denounces the proliferation of a rude form of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster acted "beyond its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, had to communicate his decisions once during the main broadcasting period within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thai boxing, now rises in the search for new challenges to the Tatami and the boxing rings of the world.
“I started fighting in Algeria 12 years ago with kung fu and kickboxing,” said Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008, in order to develop further among the pros.
Personally, I’m looking for the fight everywhere, because for those who don’t like the ground fight, like the mixed martial arts present it, competitions are rare in North America.”
Recently, the one who worked as a security officer and employed at UPS had given his rival bad news in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Championship of Amateurs held between October 23 and 30 in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
"I'm currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China."
“The fighters from each category were invited to be among the top four at the last World Cup.”
"I babe bronze in Toronto in 2009."
“In 2005, I became an eighth in Vietnam.”
“In 2007 I finished fifth in China, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto,” he added.
“It’s worth noting that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
"With this rhythm, I'll be the first one this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China where punches and kicks are allowed as well as floor throws.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer retains Zemmal only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the Kung-Fu’s Super Bowl, the “King of Sanda”.
“This competition is the highest and most respected in China,” said the sympathetic Pound Boy.
“It’s a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand).”
“It was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg), before he then lost in the final.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals meet each other in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will face up to crown a single champion, the king of Kung Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has mutually agreed to award $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the midst of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Energie Gérance", was formed in 2004 as an accompaniment to Hydro-Québec's decision to hand over its responsibility to the private sector to this important hydroelectric project for the sum of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie Gérance" secured the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to consortia of companies is a serious ethical issue that raises the risk of diversion and price increases.
“This is a new way of playing a mapped game and defusing the competition.”
“This means that instead of playing cards, instead of secretly playing games, you are now doing them in open form,” Sylvain Simard, PQ deputy, told the press conference yesterday.
Early in the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public's interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a mapped-off game.
“I remain true to my line,” she said, reassuring that the PQ had “acted dishonestly” and that it “felt hard.”
She said it was “the least” that the PQ apologized.
The model of the consortium is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid on a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity in terms of its size of work.
The construction process is underway and should be set up by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competition; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief fly-over of the Quebec company register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any linkage, and of which there are several dozen, goes back to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
As far as the consortium "energie gérance" is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has left the nose on the fact that the project management contract has been approved by agreement.
“If you make a tender and there are few applicants, your prizes will skyrocket.”
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and say to yourself: you're going to negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price."
“The idea, however, is that not the price is decisive, but the expertise of the people,” Laporte reiterated.
This contract granted to the consortium "Energie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and advisory contracts awarded to companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts in itself, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "energie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $ 449,783,344, including the contract with "Energie Gérance" over $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had announced that the PQ was equally connected to the companies it "funded" before clarifying that it was rather their executives.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The "Green" Label Is Not Confidential
Greener, but unwaveringly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main actors of sustainable growth, but neither in the labelled brands or the eco-labels that are supposed to control his choice.
It is a pity, though bathing in a media-powered universe, where information for more responsible consumption is so plentiful: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that is recognizable as a brake on its commitment, as demonstrated by the first reading held yesterday.
Although they pushed the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec’s population admits that they do not believe in companies’ environmental commitments as much as they do in green corporate advertising, according to the ingenious measuring instrument developed by the Sherbrooke University Consumer Center.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the credibility of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
Nevertheless, information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently being invigorated by almost one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to obtain.
In 2010, more than half of consumers changed their habits and changed the brand of one or more products to express their beliefs.
According to barometers, they also preferred 61% purchases from dealers in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumer of Quebec loves to present himself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and ecological awareness still seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have stated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the driving centre to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by Société Angus and Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to return it to its actual cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they asked for.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower level than initially expected, which could create a viable solution on favorable terms, at least according to the sources taken from the state rumor kitchen.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the petition has since been summed up again.
A proposal, along with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Francois Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is head of the eXcentris file.
A few days ago, he sent her a final report.
However, the Cabinet’s counter-proposal was sent to SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus have until December 31st to respond.
In any case, the premise of state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec cinema and cinema complex ownership community had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance to provide for real estate projects there that he did not provide to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the segment complained about substantial economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years with great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the Treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clients on the line.
Société Angus and Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are running a privately funded campaign, which they hope will raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not recalled the newspaper "Le Devoir" and is ignored of what he and his group think of the down-corrected proposals that have been made to them.
Secret of the complex-shake Canada uncovered
The new U.S. diplomatic leaderships spread through WikiLeaks uncover the secret of what the United Nations considers to be the Canadians’ inferiority complex to the Americans, but they also reveal the latter’s sense of superiority to Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are astonished that the Canadian electorate does not have Canadian-American relations in mind at the ballot, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly disseminated yesterday, offer even more spicy details than the mere substantial content you have to nibble on.
A connection dated 22 September 2008, during which time the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations ceased to participate in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers several explanations for this situation.
“An intrinsic inferiority complex for Canadians may cause Canadian political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than to push the United States to black Peter in this election (as in 1988 in the Campaign on Free Trade),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus “the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to speak of it.”
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
“Logically,” he assessed, “it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the electorate has in mind as a key factor in the urn.”
The other expression of this sense of importance can be seen in the message sent on January 22, 2009 by Ottawa businessman Terry Breese to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your trip will help ensure the government’s continued existence in the federal budget confidence vote in early February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, created as a result of a $30 to $40 billion revival program,” Breese said in a statement.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the conditional continuation of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed revival program.
Another January 2008 release, written by Ambassador Wilkins, notifies Washington of the increasingly negative image that the CBC broadcast dramatic series are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even take-offs for the purpose of interrogations carried out by the CIA.
Another report detailed how Hillary Clint asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
"At the end of the meeting, he handed out a paper to the Secretary of State on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, let’s note that the minds are warming about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and very close adviser to Stephen Harper, had stated through CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed".
He had spoken here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global Plan for Renewing Lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (GHG), which corresponds to nearly a third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from developed countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of CFCs released to the earth due to lighting would be avoided if the white-hot bulbs, which still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better still, light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the global fleet’s exhaust gases.
Last year, in Copenhagen, major exhaust emissions emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From this balance sheet, however, 5 Gt would have to be deducted in order to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to the year 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white glowing pears, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produces the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced again by twofold.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6,000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week – this company has participated in the UN study by the way – have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, giving an indication of the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that completely novel light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury and that they therefore have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide a pickup point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit significantly more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars annually on the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast Excited to Announce Election Results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election right after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent Electoral Commission to maintain its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," a UN chief's press spokesman said.
“It asks all parties and institutions of Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had passed the deadline set on Wednesday at midnight three days after Sunday’s election, without publishing the results.
Approximately forty minutes before the deadline, the President of CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would “go ahead with the work” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have been made, the CEI may finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp anticipates the cancellation of “fraudulent” votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, achieved by the Forces Nouvelles (FN) ex-rebel camp during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's exercises to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the election.
The entire election could be cancelled if the lawsuits brought by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more of the opinion that the country’s highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N’Dré, a politically closely related to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in promulgating the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to demand the victory.
His allies affirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing he has lost; and filing a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the Electoral Commission from publishing the results was illegal.
Sunday’s second round of presidential elections was thought to crown the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast politicians on Wednesday that they could be held responsible in the event of riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had made the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in third quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (including the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is established at 2,631 million.
The data for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and to 9.7% involving the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million people in the French metropolis were unemployed but wanted to find a job, including whether they were eligible to work every two weeks or whether they were seeking a job or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% involving the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
For their part, seniors have experienced a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 people over the age of 50, 6.6% involving the overseas departments.
Only 25-49-year-olds benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage point over one year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After a dispute about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method, announcing on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini Accused and Arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhne Region (PS), was charged with an investigation and was imprisoned in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and fraudulent markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with undermining social assets, embezzlement of general property, healership, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and gun ownership, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the public prosecutor will ask him, instead of spreading ghosts."
“It’s easy to accuse him of a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them,” his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before hearing his client.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had stressed the importance of sending a memorandum of justification to the judge before his hearing through his lawyers.
One of Guérini’s relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything but keep his landfill running.
He would never have known about the area of business competence or the destination of the associated funds, Simon said.
Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also indicted on Wednesday for undermining and accomplice, but was then released under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to explain the facts he was accused of."
"The chief prosecutor has considered not to deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released from prison on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal surveillance, according to Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "illicit influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Embarrassment and embezzlement of public property by a public service officer", and the other on account of "competence in embezzlement of public funds".
Alexandre Guérini’s life partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with “broaching and undermining social assets.”
Among the people confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of public fraud that had affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company of helping to wash money from “high” criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses particularly on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also involves waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affair Clotilde Reiss: Elysée Palace exaggerates its mediator function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for “espionage,” held the French public in breath, alerted diplomacy and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the Le Monde newspaper reveal some of the reasons behind this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of “hostages” in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French woman did not benefit the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary on the basis of trade in materials in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they highlight the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media to make it credible that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomatic telegram published in Paris on 12 August 2009 is entitled "Iran: French comments on the way to dealing with hostages".
Francois Richier, Elysée consultant on strategic issues, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method.
They advised the Americans to make every effort to return their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
“Making noise,” they said, “articulates the words “basic human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate release” in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
“Do this all the more, especially as the Iranians ask you not to do so.”
Because "silence solves nothing" passes the discussion attempts over inconspicuous ways that the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners is a “common Iranian tactic”: “hostage for the purpose of political blackmail.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on August 16th, the day she escapes to the French embassy) “is demanding the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians” (230,000 euro bail).
And he makes it clear that Elysée is anticipating further hostages, a phenomenon that "will exacerbate".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but remains detained in Iran.
An information has been circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding for illegal trade in sensitive electronics material to Iran, has been released from prison following a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which is tracking the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear program.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French?
On the occasion of a re-talk with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, Francois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision", but also tried to rebel against it.
“There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice” (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but “the French government cannot change the judicial decision,” he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" supervision by the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant chooses a phone number, puts it on again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "currently in the buildings run by the Iranian embassy in Paris."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make “escape attempts” organized by the media believe that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays an “important” and “influential mediator role.”
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that the manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 summoned "the French authorities' media flash".
What is so much “thank you” based on to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
“Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did.”
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall behind this fiction.
The intense communication efforts “are aimed at confirming Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
A policy launched in 2008, which was then perceived by numerous critics in France and abroad as premature and undeserved.
"The Syrian role is uplifting," Paris is trying to "show Syria what praise can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
It also aims to “sow discord between Syria and Iran.”
The American embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Richier told her, “Of course we don’t know if the Syrians did anything.”
"But we thanked them despite everything."
“This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriots".
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called “the Cinderella,” which will forbid the youth from playing online games after midnight by blocking them from access, government officials suggested.
A bill calling on online gaming operators to ban young people under 16 years of age from accessing these games after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of culture and family ministries described.
"Many children play these games all night long and then have trouble learning at school and also living a normal life during the day."
“We believe this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, Ministerial Commissioner entrusted with this bill for the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be available again from 6 in the morning.
The manufacturing companies had a year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government is also intent on asking manufacturers to reduce the time limit granted daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents ask for it, the person in charge added.
It will also provide free programs to those who wish to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intense internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host country
On Thursday, FIFA’s executive committee, in spite of suspicion of corruption, appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Championships, a highly political election in which the swirling for influence and lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA’s royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) specifies the degree of economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it is difficult to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA’s evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be as important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could as well have ruined the chances for its own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, namely in 1966.
The BBC had once again given it nutrient ground on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that bombards three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English leaders, who had engaged in intense lobbying with David Cameron in the past few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the move, which was succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, which had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intensive effort be enough to re-evaluate the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial shadows of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which has become a major outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadia, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unwavering allegations of the English press "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the committee members.
“You throw them with dirt, you try to compromise them,” Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of FIFA’s main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidatures seem premature for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA’s highly anticipated approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which makes the Asian chances of 2022 obsolete.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled all the registers with the anticipation of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights acclaimed by European countries (due to the time shift), FIFA’s sensitive nerve.
Second Mandate: Disclosure
De Gaulle really did.
Midrand had made believe that he was stubborn.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show any hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
A mandate in the Elysée is calling for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness is not well on the side of the mystery that adheres to the presidency function.
So you have to pretend that there is doubt from now on.
In one sense as well as in the other.
In 2006, supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded without believing it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would have the prospect of “two mandates” sounded on Tuesday evening at the Elysée in front of UMP parliamentarians, had a bit of feverishness spread.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far missing.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone.
“You have at worst seven and a half years left with me, or at best,” he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: "Don't believe I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words from the day before no longer make him a candidate than the day before; but no less.
If you make comments, for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that exhorts many members of the PS to fight earlier than assumed.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, voters on the right would prefer a candidacy of Fran ois Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to the poll of BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the prime minister said.
“If he found a defeat as possible, he wouldn’t be a candidate,” Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has settled with the obvious.
Euro: The ECB is forced to keep its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the order for a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be finalised at the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges the central bank in Frankfurt no doubt cannot afford to deal with today’s more than tense situation on the European bond markets, in order not to cause their aggravation.
The political costs would be far too high.
France’s Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB’s active role in resolving Europe’s national debt at a press conference yesterday.
She hasn’t dared to say if she thinks the central bank can do more, for example by boosting her program of buying government bonds.
"I retain my considerations for my European trading partners (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, did not speak very well about his plans the day before in Brussels during his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, but rather was content to point out that the program of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would “continue to operate” and that we will “see how the decisions will turn out” at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty: the ECB will remain unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury’s bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to around 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions of some traders, she is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government papers yesterday.
Since May 2010, Eurosystem central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion.
Among traders, there is no doubt about the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a significant change in course.
If bonds of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still be able to create unrestricted reserves of funds in a generous manner over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already making an effort today that this measure will be extended by a few months.
“I can’t imagine the ECB changing its program in a significant way.”
"Otherwise, she would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, “the ECB should maintain such a volume of bond purchases that revives the sluggish market,” adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposure of European banks to the markets of national debt in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It has to step into the market at all costs and act in such a way as to prevent the rushed enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest countries,” a key bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates start to fly high, states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government is covering up in Italy
After a disturbing start to the week for Italy, the situation relaxed a bit yesterday with the drop in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, Regional President Giulio Tremonti had classified the situation as “indecipherable” and had heard him expect an “unpredictable” weekend, which the person immediately denied.
On Tuesday, the shear with German interest rates had reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out at his Council of Ministers that Spain’s discrepancy with German interest rates was 400 basis points.
However, his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed "severe concern" about the "market turbulence" and a possible risk of infection from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the accompanying dizzying tax inputs, which put the state at risk of not being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the Senate budget for consideration is expected to be 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (against 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Therefore, the riot for a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
Italy is currently receiving support from international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment, there are no problems, neither in the short-term nor in the long-term, as Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.d.R.), is demanding lower stabilization progress than other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
The question remains of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organized at the end of March.
So there is a not very favourable period ahead for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I believe it has been proven both Sunday afternoon and evening: the Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area."
Although perfectly relative, yesterday’s deduction in the interest rate feet of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, there is no starting point for normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce Portugal's debt record, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which is particularly burdening the banking systems," said the economist of Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since “the political time passes much slower than that of the markets”.
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger it poses, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
And this also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda is the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the back of the countries of the euro area in the crosshairs of markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already begun his Asia tour in Singapour on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The EU Stability Fund’s first draft paper spending is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of Reuters had entrusted the United States with supporting a possible increase in funds mobilised by the IMF’s additional direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the first-rate countries, are in turn embarking on structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are in addition to austerity measures should have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different route than Greece and Ireland have.
Both the one and the other at all costs is to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have drawn up their own budgetary corrections and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back to trust in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are talking about the options available to speed up the normalization process of the sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was on his way through Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-engage in its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a major player in the market of European sovereign debt, judge that an extension of 100 billion euros would suffice, “preferably” in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilization, which is currently 60 billion euros.
An advisory board that has every chance to be examined attentively in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are tightening.
Snow and Glacier: 24 departments in alert orange
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in the Orange alert stage due to the imminent risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne regions have been added to the 20 departments already in the Orange alert stage; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers touch the north of the Gironde and the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow blankets are expected from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Cotes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic constraints and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
Several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tons in the region, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac traffic axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in an emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy transport on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "requires drivers to be extremely cautious on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged airlines to cancel 25% of their flights from Roissy Airport in Paris and 10% of those departing from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland will be closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has rained billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to lend a portion of the financial sum to its double on the markets.
Today we finally had our first projections.
The 2010 supplementary budget, passed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special development tax and a higher taxation of the offices on Ile-de France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the bill, goes "in favour of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
"The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year."
Second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the resulting product and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that make?
It's a mystery.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
Of the 4 billion, they are far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of capital raised by the state and that the Société du Grand Paris will gradually be provided for the project," the statement read.
In the SGP you do not find this system offensive.
“Since the moment you book income (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the project planning for over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion,” it is explained.
“This is recorded in the budget and gradually deducted.”
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 billion promises we will be able to look for for a long time, is in danger of provoking quite a moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and greedy spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a twofold meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at the international level and provides a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every file created by an intelligence agency (an x-random nation) consists exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what has been read in any x-journal for months anyway (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the frighteningly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has been providing cabaret artists with material for their sketch for a long time.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may only consist of already known news is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esothermal publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Rosenkreuzlers) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but also because he does not know where news about the non-existent could be found), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown’s success mechanism.
The same goes for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who considers only true what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a stirring about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, they say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies – at least since the end of World War II and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner – have lost their diplomatic function and have turned into espionage centers, with the exception of some small representational tasks.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it doesn’t happen out of hypocrisy that one does so to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact of publicly repeating it violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-random hacker can tap into the most secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal brings less of the victims, rather than the "sharp judges" into distress.
But let us devote ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, all power could be bundled together like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
But when one considers what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control course ceases to be unilateral and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but any citizen, or at least the hacker – chosen as the avenger of the citizen – can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold itself that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free from secrecy as it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks revealing that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets to steal, they mean.
Neither Sarkozy nor Merkel did WikiLeaks wrong, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this injustice inflicted on such a mighty power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer put any reserved information online - that would be like a poster glued to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the latest technologies, it is in vain to hope to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state is moving on an airplane and has contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and ear-only relationships be maintained in the future?
I know very well that at the moment my prediction sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I see myself compelled to imagine the government agents moving in secret on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their messages nowhere else but in mere memory, and also hiding the few written information they have received in their shoes.
The information would be stored in locked drawers in a single copy: basically, Watergate’s espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing nowadays like a cancer, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analogous) video cassettes had allowed the film researchers to explore a film band by band by being able to spool backwards and unravel all the secrets of assembly, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane, including the changeover.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to come back on car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Makes Its Financial Promises Beautiful
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the fast-track financing pledges (also called "fast-start" or premature financing) that have been realized by developing countries.
And now the rough French fairy tales have been uncovered.
Under the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU drew all the registers to convince its partners of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its true value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, which puts it on the right track to pay respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion euros in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort has been made without detrimental to public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what “new and additional” means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline that he considers best.
For example, the European Commission has chosen to be the benchmark for 2009: international financing will be maintained and 150 million euros will be added over three years as part of the funding.
Other countries have adopted similar guidelines, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of public development assistance.
In return, France felt that the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks in the expenditure of the previous year or at the global level of public development assistance.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French aid to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France pretends to comply with its commitment regarding "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often linked to emission control projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, which is taken as the equivalent of a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan to the investor country should be counted as commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU to make large loans.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among other countries) are 100% committed to making donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet their obligations, France only gives 10 cents and understands a similar commitment.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, in its fast-start financing, France operates with a double hoax: in part with a further development of the action over time and in the other part with the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" million in line with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once within the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate, if it is enough to lend?) and then in the negotiations, as the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The chapter of early financing is only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is indispensable to learn its lesson from this first year of early financing.
In the first place, France could announce a change in its bookkeeping style for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, crucial and currently debated topic): one cannot escape the question of "calculability" or the type of accounting of his loans.
France could change its position to be just as progressive in terms of disputes as it is in other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of Environment Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France’s fast-start and its vision of “reliability” and the use of loans would naturally raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A 10-year-old child takes 81 different chemicals throughout the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Générations Futures Association (former movement for the protection of rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which explains that its findings "do not represent a statistically significant value, given the small number of samples analysed, but rather represent the illustrative nature of the problem being dealt with," had purchased between July and September the foods typically consumed by a 10-year-old child at mealtimes plus a snack at the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were examined as well as snacks from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The record is devastating: 81 chemicals, including 42 potentially or likely carcinogenic and five safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptive factor, according to studies conducted by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if in the approaching aggregate of cases the legal limits for each chemical, individually ingested substance are not exceeded, it is very well taken from this survey that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with an endocrine factor is worrying," notes the association.
Already at breakfast alone, the butter and tea containing milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, including lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
Furthermore, the steak, the tuna from the box, even the baguette and the chewing gum were spiked by pesticides and other chemicals.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this “polluting cocktail” for the consumer “is likely to be underestimated,” according to the study.
In turn, the Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase of civilisation diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
