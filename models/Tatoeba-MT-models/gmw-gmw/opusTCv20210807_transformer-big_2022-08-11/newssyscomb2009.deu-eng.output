Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the big coalition to date and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria after the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the verge.
In contrast, the Alliance’s electoral head is preparing for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian provincial head Jörg Haider, for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the ÖVP scored, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history, and this is a really catastrophic result, especially with the People’s Party, which had demanded the early elections.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But voters have probably penalized the party for failing the government.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could already be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the party’s board of directors on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberal Party (FPÖ) received 18 percent, the BPÖ received 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats expressed at the same time their fear that the year 1999 could repeat itself when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it even split from the European Union).
Jörg Haider, who already stated that he was willing to work with any party, apparently relies on this development and assumes a return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics.
In addition, the Green Party entered the parliament, which suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent hurdle and therefore has not moved into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can cool off
If the problem is not solved with the Czech scientists accused in India of illegally collecting beetles, then, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be a certain cooling in Czech-Indian relations.
The minister in New York stressed this after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then for sure, there will be a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that it would be difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
In spite of all this, he argued that in the case of Petr Avacha, who was acquitted of the charges and received a fine, the central government wanted the local government in Dardjiling, in whose case the case falls.
“His problem could be resolved,” the minister said.
For Emil Kusera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi’s view would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could thus ask for release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, according to the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same opinion during negotiations.
“He recommends appealing to a higher court, then he could be pardoned,” the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convicted “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help was already being offered to them by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he reiterated, according to the Czech press agency TK, in front of his partner, the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it’s a big mistake to imprison and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
A response to the question of whether he had been promised by the Indian side to deal with the matter was avoided by the minister.
“I’ve been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech judges over wrestling around the seabed
It approaches an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
The island belongs to Australia and together with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His chief, the divisional director, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and adds it on and off.
This is where enthusiasm and enthusiasm prevail.
So far, the seabed has a little known world that is rich in natural springs.
Here you can find petroleum, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
The neighbouring states today vehemently declared their claim to the new maritime territories.
According to a UN convention, they exercised their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to several hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
Simply put, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered, which represents a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the shore sea, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the definition of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many costly studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
An international echo recently came to the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its maritime areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed granted to the country by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profit they will receive from the use of the seabed in the future will, as they promise, have invaluable value.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which the Convention calls the "common heritage of humanity".
No state has any more special status here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
“The seabed is not a gold digging land,” says Director Mikulka, adding, “whose individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored.”
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It was granted the status of a so-called "breaking investor" in 1991 due to the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"You can support it on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the fabulous shame that, according to the Golem, brought to life.
German Special Forces were on site during hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come into use.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven kidnapped European tourists in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officials of the GSG 9, the aircraft squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Auxiliary Service were at the site of the liberation.
However, German forces were not needed, as spokesmen for the ministries said on Monday evening, because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the assistance offered by Germany in order to involve it as a local support force.
“Fortunately, this has not happened,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions were kidnapped on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been taken back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information about when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House rejects rescue package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has made the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets almost fail.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the government’s bailout package for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called for parliamentarians to agree, even though the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
Investors were concerned that the bailout package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, crashed again.
Experts are now expecting further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required for the program to enter into force.
Organizers record rising booking numbers
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to a study, sales of travel bookings for the coming months have increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the Germans’ desire to travel remains untroubled, according to one study.
For bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a sales increase of 31 percent compared to the same period last year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study by the market research institute GfK, there are already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
For example, the sales increase of the travel agencies for October amounted to around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
The results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates booking data from 1200 German travel agencies on a monthly basis and calculates it for the overall market.
This includes travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar price, travel to the US is in particular in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking increase amounts to around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic areas are particularly popular destinations among the Germans.
Package travel in particular would be high on the course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "better calculable for the customer than for individually organized holidays".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there will again be an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although, according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter-cups and celebrities in designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers just jump on us and clip the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first meadow visit.
That's how you make friends.
The low-cost dirndl seems to be fulfilling its purpose.
As a Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the white sausage equator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited to date.
But once you arrive at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only harvests my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman reminds me that I had tied the apron incorrectly: "Left is free, middle virgin, right forgiven, rear widowed."
I secretly freaked out the loop from the back to the left.
"That's right," he said and laughed.
Others put less effort into subtle flirting techniques and wear plain felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch out the bare back of an uninvited one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is named Bob, who comes from England and also attends the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it “gorgeous”, with an elongated “ooooo”.
He tells me that after he has taken away his previously drunken measure.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics run in droves over the festival site, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time carry a covered carrier from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: Empty, fully back.
You can't see who's under the tarpaulin in the promille coffin.
"These are the ones that goarnimmer pack," one of the paramedics called to me on request and disappeared in the tumult.
Name of Accident Victim Announced by Police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey aspired to join the European Union, the European powers were keen to penetrate deep into Turkey’s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the neo-renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sitsrittlings at the end of the platform with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is disintegrating.
But once you’re inside the arched ticket counter, there’s no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a pacifier in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train link to Damascus, Baghdad, and further on to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperialist plans faded during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces pulled out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly decayed, largely bypassed by history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Turkey.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the neighboring regions, created by the boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the key figures of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, Turkish MEP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the old world's step in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is regarded as a new city, for the new secular state plan, to turn my back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP headquarters, a custom-made, state-of-the-art stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb, surrounded by semi-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers in suits, both men and women, met to complete the first shops of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
“The goal of the party’s foreign policy is now to re-integrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception,” he told me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She should do both.
“But certainly Turkey could be forced to decide at some point,” I asked.
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here said almost routinely: Turkey’s relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, in a figurative sense, Europe as a whole can travel eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East on the same railroad tracks.
Back at Hydarpashas station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German masters, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this structure 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited at the dock for the ferry to take me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for teenagers up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer of forms) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to tackle any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a Madrigal or from the Messiah, a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and only due to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music that never faded for years.
How often did death keep us from “let the music speak for itself”?
He used to say, “The composer knows what he wants.”
It's all in the music.
So sing it!”
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never masculine but never exuberant.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor had been beaten to be a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
For the past 40 years or so, I’ve written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – often I’ve been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He abhorred conductors who, according to his words, simply “goed to house in the world with one or two well-known shovels.”
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA, and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from an author’s remark in Woodruff’s book “Beyond Nab End,” but it’s not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 as part of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
“I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino ‘Flamenco and Life’ because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them for their simplicity and for the power they radiate, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.”
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda starts marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this wide-body sedan offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are the technical subtleties that make it even more convenient to drive and save on gasoline.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this large-scale sedan are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
Nevertheless, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz will be released six years later, after the first generation was released on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz had appeared on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83.000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of total sales at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the heads of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales decline in Spain.
In reality, the heads of the brand hope to close the year with total sales of 22,000 models. That is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% reduction.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed across the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of Insight on the market is planned for the first months of the year, with its public presentation taking place in Valencia for the first time in January.
In terms of the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has grown 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing the dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new room flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the previous model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading space, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be emphasized that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4 liter petrol engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 liter petrol engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz being only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model has 2 versions of petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to get to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 HP model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
‘Auto-Bee’ Avoiding Collisions
To drive the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight stems from the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the prestigious University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the bee’s facet eyes, which can see in all directions over an angle of 300 degrees, allowing it to fly undisturbed in its personal airspace without interruption.
To replicate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles that are at a distance of up to two meters from the BR23C and within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to the object, and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is immediately translated into signal for avoiding the collision.
The moment obstacle is noticed, the small robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels by 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference to other systems is that this maneuver takes place instinctively.
If not, the robot might not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Laboratory of Mobility and the senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot can't deviate up or down, but it can't deviate over-corner; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function so that the small robot avoids the collisions.
“This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act on this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of the disk space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan is predicting to introduce in series cars over the next decade.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite in order to lead to the destination while driving while avoiding the obstacles along the way.
She's trembling before being charged with a mortgage.
One must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis, and to avoid getting US citizens involved in mortgage histories of allegedly payable banks, a fun and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: “Bad Credit Hotel,” it says.
Or maybe the ‘hotel of bad credit’ or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think one, two and up to three times about whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly it has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a fantastic room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley Provides Capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend $9 billion to take over 21% of its capital, an innovation attributed to a strong fall in its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks announced that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s common shares at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total of $3 billion.
The price assumed is less than 19% of the stock’s price value as of 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure it a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be done on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, which is 28% above the current price value.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock fell by 6.79% at 17.00 GMT to $23.07.
“This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which is intended to allow him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been changed over the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of her shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, said in Tokyo, “we thought the stake would be entirely common stock.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and hedge ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go on with a reduction in profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement stipulates that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in a year if the latter are exchanged to more than 50% above the sale value within a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a solvency rate of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had “significantly” lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group that had to watch their stock market price drop by half as the price of insurance against insolvency skyrocketed.
This price fell on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other ‘survivors’ of the major Wall Street investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Re-establish the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint plan of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and equatorial Rafael Correa.
That third was the one who, following the example of his like-minded and friends, put the plan for a new constitution to the vote this Sunday.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results of 80% of the votes, 64% voted ‘yes’ in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be approved, more than half of all votes cast must be voted.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at polling stations’ exits and a count of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for ‘yes’, prophesying 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The “constitution has triumphed in an overwhelming way,” he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held silently according to the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a 444-point text to secure the “new socialism” for which the president is committed.
The constitutional project transfers state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that lives largely on oil production by foreign companies and on foreign exchange that sends immigrants into the country.
The project, which is being pushed forward by the 2006 elected Correa, also grants the head of state more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two successive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to implement in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorial base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were liberated in Chad.
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the hijackers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
You are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital healthy and intact this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated from Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages reached the military base of al-Maza next to Cairo’s international airport around 3:30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreigner district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all “best health” and the hijackers “were not paid a ransom,” Egypt’s tourism minister Zoheir Garanna said.
After being captured on September 19 on an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly taken from one hiding place to the next by 35 unknown hijackers.
They are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the Special Forces, from two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“On both sides, shots were dropped and half of the hijackers were killed, the rest fled,” said this person in charge, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian Special Forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces have played.
"We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and the special forces," he said.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
On the evening before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped a patrol vehicle in which the hijackers were located, six of which they killed, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army stated that it was linked to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unite (SLA-U), which, however, immediately denied the movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate about the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central topic of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no real laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros solely for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors have written in their country’s constitution that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all government districts, by mutual agreement.
In Quebec, in the Association of History Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 history societies endeavour to deal intensively with history, save with a few pennies the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to take care of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been in turmoil as a result of the US financial crisis: The three countries provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institute, which also has branches in Hungary.
Over the weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner for Competition of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
In line with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell some of its holdings, most notably the insurance activities acquired by the Dutch company ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis started a steep descent last week, with serious crisis scenarios already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is far too large for a bankruptcy.
The Institute’s securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the Group’s market value amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic, according to the management.
According to management, the $700 billion U.S. bailout package and the insecurity it creates in the markets is to blame for the decline of Fortis stocks.
On Monday, however, the prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new General Director of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any prospect with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was seeking reassurance - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
So far, no panic has erupted among the customers, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the Chicken Coop
Because of a person’s medication consumption, life and health insurance in America often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are privacy programs that link the use of the drug data to the consent of the data subject in any case.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we will entrust the chickens to the fox" - cites Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies determine the fees as well as the amounts paid in the event of damage depending on the health status of the customer, and should the risk be assessed too high, the insurance will not be concluded at all.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Using the customer's identification number, he draws the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e., which preparations have been purchased, and the program calculates what disease the customer suffers from and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatably high, which would automatically rank him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so the insurance companies only need to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and hot flashes, but also against depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the insurers’ point of view, while the ones mentioned above are not.
Own companies have formed for the query and processing of the data, which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
Now they have to do this by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and link them to the data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of the patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling its use at the same time becomes more difficult.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to service providers in the health sector and insurance companies.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program further, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, as the insurance companies otherwise do not enter into a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the fox's mercy.
Global menu from Marseille
India and the European Union doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main topic alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the Franco-Indian summit is also taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear sector.
While the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging, democratic power that should be given more votes and voices on international concerns, member states have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached that trade should double over the next five years, i.e. increase to well over EUR 100 billion.
Given the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 had increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into one agreement, so that aviation will also be stimulated in the future.
India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The goal is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convocation of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, i.e. reducing pollutant emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed to this, as did the proposal to make a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the subject of the financial crisis.
The Indian head of government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped to receive orders from French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the agency reports, the agreement is to be decided for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurter Buchmesse expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries to attend the event. They will be spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and will present more than 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the honorary guest of the event.
Maria Giro, undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, will represent the Italian Government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition room "Punto Italia".
A press conference will follow near the room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign writers is decreasing throughout the adult and youth sector in particular.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's Small Airplane Disappeared a Year Ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a plateau of 3,000 m altitude, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains were found.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson fully refuted the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, to which a force has been sent out. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Office of Traffic Safety (NTSB) noted that only a few hours after the aircraft was sighted, a crew was dispatched to identify the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had started a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were found by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two ID cards called Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, he was the first person to orbit the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover by plane.
Among his many records is a flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A suv that falls out of the conventional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the expansive surface and its clear angles.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
Especially because of its exceptional features, the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on show in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17th.
The advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in various stages, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, by 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como intended to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its near-real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details at different moments in order to reassemble as a whole.
Undoubtedly, Mercedes’ aim with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of advertising in this rather stereotypical field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers?
Now it is clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 guys and girls who are ashamed of all of Italy? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been behind the Italian national team for years and which, honestly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
So far, there have never been any clashes with opposing fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
Other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia joined them in Sofia.
They carry the tricolori, on which the cities of the militants appear: however, they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was a clash with a truly right-wing fan scene, Levski’s.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those who travelled to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing ban on the stadium.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already preloaded in this respect, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for reports from the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thankfully.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation offenders, who could follow this little more than 150.
“This fire has to be kicked out immediately, and that under no circumstances gives such a behavior the opportunity to justify it,” the Viminal says.
Therefore, "eyes on especially also with regard to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sports Supervision), on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services, which deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed clearly without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now comes a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist – adds the number 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are punishable in the country of their deeds.
Until now, this group had held back, but now it is necessary to reconsider what has happened and will happen.
But let us also talk about the whistles during the hymn Mamelis: even this is not a crime, but let me, because there is no education."
