The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into the minus.
After the steep fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with the shares of EZ reached almost half of normal day-to-day business.
At the beginning of Tuesday’s business, the Prague Stock Exchange continued to collapse from Monday, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the burglary was Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market’s reaction to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which it had refused to support a stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, stocks on the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall, although the indices were able to offset some of the losses over the course of the day.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Stock Exchange index lost nearly four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was able to offset some of the losses later, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
The stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but then reduced the losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
“The timing of the rescue in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide,” said Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy itself, i.e. independent of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. legislators should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible and pass the draft financial system support.
Otherwise, other countries would be affected by the collapse.
A Massacre of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, which should be spent up to $700 billion (nearly $12 trillion).
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s request to support the plan.
In Bush’s view, the plan would settle the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks experienced a massacre on Monday, and the major stock indices recorded the largest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index declined by almost 7%, a similar decline it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there was little evidence that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress concedes: U.S. government is allowed to pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement to provide financial assistance to the U.S. financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a breakthrough in talks about the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory.
Congressmen still have to negotiate some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, told Reuters.
The Senate could vote on the plan at the earliest on Wednesday, according to different reports.
According to economists, a communication on the adoption of the plan should be the first significant psychological factor in revitalizing financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "disappointment" due to the complicated mechanisms, how the markets could also be helped in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our different views on what a market stabilization package should look like,” said Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.
According to her, there could be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislature met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the night after Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This envisages a buy-off of unpurchased mortgage assets from the financial companies, which plunge financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must be effective in the market.
We need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we’re at the goal,” Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are declining sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
This is intended to reassure investors of transactions in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision by Congress could affect business on Monday.
So far, however, it is not entirely clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, and there is also uncertainty as to whether the negotiations could fail at the last minute on a problem.
Legislators hope it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will have some changes.
The total amount allocated to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be provided as soon as possible, as President George Bush demanded.
Congress, however, can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, at another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiation
The president has the right to veto this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has persisted, which was based on obtaining finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
“We’ve worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The US President Bush was also pleased with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and “appreciated the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of golden parachutes
Senate banking committee chairman Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing benefits, and a schedule for funding the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies involved in the program and establish a committee to supervise the fund.
The Ministry of Finance will lead it.
“We have worked very hard and made great progress towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also anticipates help for homeowners who have trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new installments on mortgages that it buys up, with the goal of reducing the monthly costs for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to Patria Finance’s chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but implementation will be very difficult.
“That’s because you don’t know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought.
This will be crucial for how the financial sector and the government divide the losses among themselves,” Marek told the server iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or at the beginning of next week is not crucial in Marek’s view.
“It is much more important that Congressmen agree to support the plan and that they say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
The psychological importance of the agreement on a passing is the most important thing at this moment,” Marek stressed.
Duel on Messer's cutting edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls yet.
So, of course, it looks better to just buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons why you should get an independent player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
It’s hard to buy an expensive record player at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
Once such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably dream of at least one.
This is how it is simplified with music when traveling, i.e. with compressed music - music in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For one, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will probably not be able to handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what mobile phones can do, they don’t even create indicatively.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the sims, it can play music and videos, record both, it sometimes has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you include the smartphones and communicators, you have almost a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a little wonder, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph.
But the universality of the mobile phones also brings disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for longer than ten to twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect the cheap phones to be able to play music for no more than a few hours.
If you still call from time to time, you would rather buy a charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones will endure at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation at once.
Another problem is if you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices have a USB port, and not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can transfer the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers are done without reduction with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
For players, you do not need any special software except for exceptions (iPod).
You only need to feed the device with music from your PC via USB port.
Most mobile phones and players themselves create a music library, ordered by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the evaluation by users.
Some devices only map the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire about the battery life, storage capacity, quality and type of sound and, of course, ease of use.
If music is the backdrop for you and you listen to it every day only briefly, for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
What almost every cell phone can do.
You also do not have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 creates all, and most of the music you get will just be in this format.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online.
You only need to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile internet, and you can now buy a song or album.
This service can in itself be a striking argument for why you should buy a music cell phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is poor and is mostly limited to fast radio hits.
The prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of music sales (whether via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, grab the phone in your pocket while the player is lying forgotten at home.
However, it depends on whether you also carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can rely on the built-in speaker that almost every mobile phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of the music mobile phones will be in price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that no normal headphones are included.
The best and most technically sophisticated phones with a 3.5mm opening for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players in turn lies in the easy operation.
The simplest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - players can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the formerly normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable, is obvious.
There is no threat of collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile internet and a subsequently horrifying invoice for data transmissions.
What device should you reach now
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable storage media (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even if you buy a card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But be careful.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can read 8GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, then reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you will then have to put no more than 1100 Kronen on the table.
Be one of the more demanding listeners, take specialized phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have stand-alone control buttons for MP3, and the ease of use comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The furthest here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, maximum up to 35 hours) will provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer practically all services, as are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Nevertheless, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classics at lower prices.
Maybe he won’t wait long.
We have often reported on Mobil.cz that the Czech mobile carriers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority T, which pointed out that the price of an SMS is higher here than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps taken by the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming fees, there is so likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile carriers, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
Why are the prices in the Czech Republic so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a fight statement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, because in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to scold the fact that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
This is often also supported by the Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Authority (CTA) Pavel Dvorák, who in the past had often stated that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of chances (by the way, he would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is another possibility – a virtual provider.
Particularly the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market resulted in a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile providers also had to respond.
Before such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the UK market, there were voices similar to those in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can really be successful.
By the way, you don’t have to look for examples for long.
In February we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need far fewer customers than a classic provider.
They do not require relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual providers usually stand out as low-cost companies - they offer cheap phone calls and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a pretty good move to bet on a non-cliché target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
“Real guys choose Mobilking – the provider they like and trust,” said David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could take root in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone Miroslav’s spokesperson for the press said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of service provision."
In the Czech Republic, mobile operators mean
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile carrier conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be Mobilking.
“While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not particularly hopeful.
Mobilking will be more likely to enter the market in other countries in our region," said Jana Studniá, a spokeswoman for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything to ensure that no potential competitor emerges.
For some time now, the GTS Novera Group has shown its interest in launching a virtual mobile service provider, which wants to take another step in becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in providing our customers with not only fixed-line, but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile carriers.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve negotiation progress," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe there are better times now.
Unofficial information indicates that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
To date, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
“At this moment, we don’t expect there to be room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
No subject has yet addressed us with a complex and reputable project in this area," said Vlastimil Sr.e. from the Telefónica O2 press department in his statement to Mobil.cz.
Other providers also point to the specifics of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2’s statement: “So far, we have not found a viable and mutually beneficial project to continue on.”
And she adds: “T-Mobile’s network will hardly see a virtual provider by the end of the year.
At this moment, we would have to have a concrete offer to be able to think in such a short time.”
Vodafone focuses more on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
“We are open to negotiating with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we see as the best from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - hand in hand with the providers
The actions of the mobile operators are easy to understand, another provider would be more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decline in profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of ‘T’ came from the company T-Mobile at the time when U:fon came on the market.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the T websites.
Now, however, U:fon is suitable as an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has also recently been strengthened by the entry of a fourth mobile service provider.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
Given this approach, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is surprising.
It is not just the attitude of the T, which unfortunately, unlike the UK and other highly developed countries, does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It is owned exclusively by the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OHS).
This, however, involved his typical attitude to this whole problem.
“The entry into the market of a virtual mobile carrier would be possible after a contract has been concluded between a mobile carrier and a virtual carrier for renting the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, because the offer of potential prospects was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of the .OHS in his reply to our question.
From representatives of the providers would not surprise such a wording.
This is more than a concern of an authority that represents consumer interests and, among other things, is to ensure that no one abuses their position on the market.
Particularly when Kristián Chalupa adds: "Above all, abroad, where virtual providers work normally, it is to be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction probably do not belong to the interests of the OHS.
Really shocking in this case is the almost already touching harmony of the three mobile carriers, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same gasoline price at the gas stations is certainly just a coincidence and the result of a tough competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any indications of anti-competitive action in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions in the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market to virtual providers are probably also lacking in the telecommunications regulator,” Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many controversial points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by the “T”, after which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile carriers have a dominant position.
Some legal experts, however, offer a different view - for a virtual provider to enter the market, the consent of the network operator is always necessary.
And, logically, the mobile provider has the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily occupies a dominant position in a particular segment.
But even if you don’t agree with this argument, it should be at least a warning for the OHS that three mobile carriers are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when negotiating with all providers.
The diversion of responsibility to the T is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the OHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has already been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act did not succeed in enforcing the extension of the competences of the T to the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the OHS have to know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's okay when no one is looking
First of all, the functioning of any pseudovirtual providers, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
They are companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but they are only partially public.
Usually, these are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile telephone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile carriers prohibit similar resale.
"If there are cases that you describe, it may be a violation of the contractual terms, which we will then deal with, which may lead to an end to the cooperation with the appropriate company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question on this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing does not go around with the managers of the mobile providers.
Particularly in the case of the three companies mentioned, they can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator is opposed to such an approach.
The profits from the activities of these companies are not negligible, but at the same time, unlike the actual virtual providers, they are not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav points out that there may be problems: "The law allows for such speculation, despite the fact that the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not running on their name, so they can’t have full access to it like the normal customers of the mobile carriers.”
But that alone should at least be strange.
There is also another question for the OHS.
The mobile operators are closing their eyes before such action, why are they blocking themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the OHS has quite strong competencies for detecting such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the statement made by the providers that they do not know about it and their terms and conditions would prohibit it.
When the Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasized several times in the text, the market entry of virtual providers brought with it a significant price decrease in the various services.
In practically all countries where virtual providers have emerged, the classic providers have tried to prevent their emergence more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, the regulatory authorities intervened at these moments, which did not try to protect the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they managed to create the first virtual operator, and more followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing up the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than favorable in these cases.
But let's not throw the gun in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon emerges, the Czech mobile market may be set to move again soon.
If a provider allows the emergence of a virtual mobile carrier, the OHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating) other prospects.
And the Czechs will finally not be more expensive than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of the Czech Statehood, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where Is My Homeland.
The anthem was re-recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jia Bulhohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo vocals, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The song was written by Kateina Knánková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremi’ and Jaroslav Krácek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
The Czech national anthem is one of the most beautiful hymns for Bolohlávek.
Earlier, he had told the Czech Radio that he had chosen singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are striking and popular.
"From the very beginning, I have tried to keep a clear diction with both and then with the choir, so that the text is well understood, so that a harmony is created," says the conductor.
The Czech National Anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov máj first sounded in 1834 on the stage of the stall theatre in the originally Czech piece Fidlovaácka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music came from Franti’ek Ekroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song then became an organic part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound?
The Prague transport companies are also transporting on a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, will go down in the history of Prague's transport operations as a date when the first passengers to board a subway, tram or bus will be able to carry an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
Currently, about one hundred thousand people can buy them, who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day, a 90-day or an annual coupon (valid from 1 January 2009) and can play it on their chip card at the information centers and branch offices of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Mástek, Nádrac Holecovice, Andal, Roztyer, Kazary, Kazary, and Kozany.
Since yesterday, the coupons are also available via the Internet on the pages of the transport companies www.dpp.cz.
The service was used until the afternoon by more than four hundred customers.
Those who use the internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they had to wait regularly in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, which is displayed on the Opencard in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these places, travelers also have a desk with trained staff available, which advises interested parties on buying the internet and also puts the coupon on the card," says project spokesman Martin Opatrn.
In addition to the libraries, you can also add the electronic coupons to the open card at self-service machines, which are attached in some subway vessels.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, remind of ticket scorers, the passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“There are currently five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty,” Opatrná adds.
A machine controls the coupon instead of the driver
The operation of the vending machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
You just have to introduce the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon will appear on its own.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants of the municipalities of the region Central Bohemia get to the capital.
"In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport system, the train attendants have readers with which they can check the validity of the coupons by time and zone," explains Filip Drápal from the organisation Ropid, who compiles the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the driver's checkout.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be shown to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked point on the side of the checkout.
In this way, the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For a passenger to check the validity of the coupons, nothing is easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not travel on suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon ends can in turn go to the self-service vending machines, where the coupons are deposited on the card.
Here the information about the validity of its documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had requested the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States in 1945.
This is evident from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, in 1945 some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the US president.
Among other things, this is evident from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau in the letter ask the American president not to allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads.
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - in knowledge of the Czech national character - would expect brutality, recklessness, lack of understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
“We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you are addressing this area to a state that is foreign to us, which oppresses and tries to eliminate minorities, and has contributed nothing at all to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors can’t sign is allegedly the fear of vengeance from the “Czech oppressors”.
If the US president has doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a referendum in the Bohemian Forestgau on whether the inhabitants would become part of the USA or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some contemporary witnesses, it draws a good picture of the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even though the Bohemian Germans had to at least suspect that they would be negotiated on their deportation from the republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Others thought they could just stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was employed in the war as a Budweiser German in the navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came into British captivity at the end of the war and was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They believed that if they came home, the Czech would suit them,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, in his opinion, expected him to be expelled from the Republic on the basis of the Benei decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An Emotional Campaign for Drivers
The most expensive action on the roads in Czech history.
This is also how the emotion-laden media campaign that the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday can be characterized.
The authority of Minister Alea Zébeek promises to detach drivers from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will run on TV, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on flyers.
It's supposed to get rid of drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remind you to put on your belt before the ride starts.
The campaign wants to speak to the consciences of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
The "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign also bears witness to this:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "do not think" are in capital letters on a badge.
And in a bloodshed there is the word "pay."
This means that you can pay for a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers by 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see normal images with drastic shots of accident victims.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and traffic fatalities on the Czech roads.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for motorists
"For the drivers, the motto is sugar bread and whip.
Sugar bread means that if they drive red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk,” says Na Homolce Martin Koin, a traffic psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
Even less effective, in his opinion, are panels that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you set up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow to the surroundings, and the drivers will not notice it," Koin said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government, Ehud Olmert, has expressed his support for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace can be reached in exchange with Palestine and Syria.
He emphasized this in an interview that was printed by the daily Jediot Achronot on Monday.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similarly high percentage to the Palestinians, because without it there will be no peace," he added.
He acknowledged that any return would include East Jerusalem.
“He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, does not want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to do without a part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in reference to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the temple bears and sacred and historical places" located on the territory of the old town.
“The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won’t work,” he continued.
Deduction from the Golan Heights
Olmert advocated a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
“My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights,” Olmert said.
“The Syrians know all too well what they have to do to get the Golan Heights back.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they give to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq,” the prime minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
They do not know the law, walking around in a long-distance bus is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a bus owned by the Student Agency near the Italian city of Padua, the question arises whether stewards and passengers are allowed to run back and forth on the bus during the journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward would be contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old steward last week, was probably caused by the driver of the truck who crossed the path for the bus.
At that moment, the young woman was sitting next to the driver, in the least secure place in the car, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident or brake sharply when the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
It also plays a role whether the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the passengers must sit.
Student Agency’s long-distance buses have no standing places, as confirmed by the company’s director, Radim Jansura, to Aktuáln.cz.
“We discussed this with the Ministry, and this initially did not agree with the movement of travelers.
Later this was taken back, and we have reached a consensus that travelers can go to the toilet while driving if they have their seats," he said.
The law doesn’t know a steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward – no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legislation prohibiting the carrier from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the term “vehicle attendant”; however, it does not define its rights and obligations,” the spokesman for the Ministry of Hanzelka clearly adds.
The director of the road vehicles department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorná, on the other hand, believes that the law covers this problem later.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing places in the product approval.
That’s all,” he emphasizes.
Buses are divided into city buses where there are standing places and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing places and higher permitted speed, and long-distance buses without standing places with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in a plane, the expert says.
The BESIP expert for road safety Jaroslav Hoin does not see the movement of stewards on board a bus as a fundamental problem.
“With a liquid mode of travel, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it's not sure when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can kick her head."
However, if a bus is sharp, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like in a city bus or on a tram.
The safety of the stewards must be clarified by the carrier through internal regulations,” he says and also thinks that this problem is not completely solved from the point of view of the law.
Januura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to offer stewards services.
The company employs about two hundred people in this function.
The director does not consider her job to be risky even after the accident.
“But as soon as I get the impression that the steward’s profession is risky, I will cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided on board.
It would also reduce costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the absence of stewards in his buses, but his company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
“We don’t have stewardesses, but we’ve been fighting back from the start.
Sooner or later, this will end with some fatal accident," he said in a statement.
It was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the region of Pilsen, who had worked for the company for two years, was killed.
The Slovenian truck was probably deflected from the stand strip without flashing and had blocked the bus from driving.
The driver of the bus tried to dodge by a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front part of the truck.
That the two seats had been sold for the stewards, Januura denies.
"These seats cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company is suing truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman’s family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but it also expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
A change of law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards aboard a bus could bring a legal regulation on which a 30-strong team of experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
“This, however, has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the top speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones during the journey," says expert Hoin.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that could significantly jeopardize the safety of passengers," Hanzelka said, with control of the safety of buses being in the competence of the police and occupational health and safety authorities.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
Big words are not missing in the letter from the WestLB board of directors to the staff of the house.
By merging units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt deca bank, "the central capital market house of the savings bank financial group" could be created, according to the letter, which became known on Monday.
The WestLB is bringing a "competence block" with sustainable profitability into such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus to further bundles in the state banking sector.
This is what it reads when a board wants to demonstrate ability to act in difficult times.
Because the depressed WestLB is still under tremendous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which the North Rhine-Westphalian state government has only recently made clear, the time is urgent to find a solution for the future.
However, there has been talk of a connection between the Deka-Bank, which savings banks know for their investment funds, and the WestLB for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka Bank chief Franz Waas made it clear at the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August, in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB, he sees no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, which is each half supported by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbände, has commissioned the Management Board to hold discussions with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be the capital market business or parts of it.
The talks, it is said at the financial center, have only just begun.
The Deka Bank, which with its 3,000 employees is one of the most important employers at the Frankfurt financial centre, is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, it looked as if the Deka-Bank could merge with the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing became of this threefold covenant.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government opposed Helaba’s participation in them.
The other two houses did not meet either.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been thought games about a connection between the Deka-Bank and Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against planning games about going together with his house.
Regardless, however, the realization seems to mature that a merging of the various houses of the public sector is necessary.
Now that the state elections in Bavaria are over, the first thing that could come closer is a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the partners will gradually go out for it.
In the south, she was only a junior partner, even though she has survived the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which has an 85 percent stake in Helaba, pushed a bar earlier this year for a merger with West LB.
It was the North LB.
But such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other hand, the question is how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question as to which business model should be used to ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken has not yet been answered by the German Sparkassen- und Giroverband.
In the end, there could also be a dismantling of the West LB, which, of course, is not desired there.
Thus, in the letter of the local board of directors, it is also mentioned that there is definitely an aim for a "total solution" for the house.
How this can be combined with the merging of individual units with the Deka-Bank will be shown.
The second Wiesn weekend is known as "Italian weekend"
For Elena, it is the first, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is with him as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-litre Kaiser brand beer barrel, stands a massively built bearded bear and proves to the about 200 Oktoberfest traveler what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a knock, then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova train station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", will depart at 11.45 p.m. this evening.
Three buses are mainly reserved for Italians, and only Brazilians travel in one bus.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated at night.
And so loudly, Marco Guarda says, that’s not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with fur imitation lining and glasses with wide silver brackets, owns the buses.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for five years, three tours this year alone.
At night, back on the meadow during the day, at 22.30.
Staying overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser-Beer, brewed faithful to the Bavarian purity bid, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada towards "Brennero".
There is no beer, not yet.
Soon it will be quiet in the bus, the travelers will sleep.
Well, they'll still need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates take a break on the motorway 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos Group arrives in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco gives one final speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On the left is "Octoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marcos travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
"When the doors to the beer tent open, it's called running," Marco cries in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Don't go forward, otherwise we'll block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, spread out in the room!"
The measure, Marco screams, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget to tip.
“The security officers show that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they are gone!”
Thirdly, "Tonight, come back here at half past eleven!"
And we're going to the meadow.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as roadmarks to the trees, signs and even the electoral poster of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
They want to be prepared for the retreat.
It’s the second weekend of meadows, known as the “Italian weekend”.
There are no exact figures; there are 50,000 people who make their way across the Alps and come to the beer tents, 10 percent of all visitors are said to have traveled extra from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains a nation statistic in which the Italians occupy the first place before British (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical care.
The Hofbräuzelt is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, said Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relatively" and also made it clear that the German banking sector is not spared from the crisis.
Because it has now entered the weekend.
The Munich real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE) receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan aid amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it takes.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The reason for this is the loss of her daughter Depfa.
According to a newspaper report, the state financier had refinanced himself for long-term projects for which he lent money in the extremely short term - which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserve declined by 95 percent to EUR 2.37 million, while the equity ratio also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period last year, while income from attributions to receivables and certain securities as well as from the dissolution of provisions in the credit business fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to higher earnings from reimbursement of downstream offsetting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest under the tax regulations and from the business order for Group companies, the earnings reduction had still been moderate at around 16 percent.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been distributed in the Aareal Bank.
Because they earned too little in traditional state funding, Depfa had become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of joint projects of private investors and the state (Private Public Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter, Hypo Real Estate must now make depreciation that will have a "significant material effect" on the profit and loss account of the group, it is quite indeterminate.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
In 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a major public and infrastructure financier.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market because it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among the banks is again largely dry, as the banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds to refinance part of Depfa’s credit portfolio annually – around EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are met with the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded “from the influence of the currently largely inactive international money markets.”
From other sources it can be heard that thanks to the funds the refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke said that Hypo Real Estate Group would no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
This is for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even unthinkable that the funding does not have to be fully used.
But the opposite cannot be ignored either.
After the bank was still facing bankruptcy late on Sunday evening, even the at least provisional bailout could not calm the minds.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the bond prices are pretty good.
While the primary debt is hardly moving, the rates of the subordinated bonds are more marked.
This concerns in particular the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, understandably, the durations that extend beyond 2009.
If hypo-real-estate bonds were formerly a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the sharp intensification of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which with the takeover of the Depfa had only brought the crisis into its own.
As long as central banks, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that pensions will be repaid in due time.
Or something happens that hardly anyone dares to hope for at the moment - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in view of the reports overlapping with the partial nationalization, the probability bordering on security has now become only a justified hope.
This should provide long-term creditors with a few sleepless nights of deciding whether to separate from their commitments.
After all, short-term investors can use a closing stroke to form a loss transfer for future withholding tax payments on price gains of later years.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is supposed to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas - in the new exchange log she tells about Japan.
“The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before school, I had bamboo.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The start of teaching at the Tachibana does not seem to be as strict as at our home in Lower Saxony.
The students enter at eight o’clock, until at twenty to nine a short round of discussion begins with the teacher, the ‘home room’.
But before the class started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the guy who likes to talk to people, and I'm not the guy who likes to talk to a class of 40 students.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt for my host mother, plus blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I stood in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Where she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language about two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all tumbled, giggled and whined and constantly I heard the word "Kawaii".
I knew that from my manga.
It is part of the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly rushed to my place.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she thought it was an honor for the exchange student to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was really stunned.
Everyone was talking and giggling and asking me for holes in my stomach - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
During the break, everyone unpacked their bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunch box - this is something else than the barren German break bread.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in tofu coat.
I have no idea what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salted plums, brrrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then crafts particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during a break snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can watch this too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
After all, I’ve loved reading manga for years.
And in order to better understand the comics and the culture in them, I also started to learn a little bit of Japanese at some point.
So it was clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I also have a fondness for tradition, customs and customs.
And that's what we put great value on here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends – on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I didn’t feel lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
A rat or a cockroach flees in danger, does it also feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
Only how can you check if they feel the same way when they behave similarly to us?
In the internet magazine "Edge", contributions of famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else ever being able to prove this where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions of feeling or, more generally, of consciousness, we enter impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as many other animals: it stands dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, which is why some scientists suggest a similar subjective experience.
However, I do not believe in that.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and in execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
So, at least on those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowing who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity may lie in the linguistic nature of man: Since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness does not depend on language, it would certainly affect it, so that animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, his research presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more scientifically accessible.
One could study the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their contents, and that is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially the example of visualization.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the emergence of visualization.
What is the result for the sensations?
I draw them back to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies memory.
In this way, sensations are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that distinguish primates and, in particular, humans.
Connected with linguistic nature, there are fine gradations of feeling, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar, in order to attribute them to others besides ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-sensing regions of the cortex and brainstem are similar to Jaak Pankseep, which, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed very much in the course of human evolution, it could well be involved in cross-generational sensations.
In theory, I cannot disagree with this, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be like fear in rats and people probably feels like this in both cases: but how can you check whether rats and people feel the same when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in danger if it also feels fear?
In my opinion, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison further helps: rats and humans have similar brain stems, on the other hand, not even a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove it to humans, how would you prove it to rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is waving at the neural level, if you measure the same in rats and humans.
As I don’t explore language and consciousness in rats, nor sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
You might think of it as short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than run against a wall all the time.
I am a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: Mercy period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
“The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the European Championships together with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
Perhaps even the number of EM stages will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can no longer waste time.
We must now work at the highest speed," said Ukrainian Federation President Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time."
An even more radical step was taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission had met at the request of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
“There is a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several first league players had been sentenced to a forced descent in the past season alone for manipulation, after all, even the league start had to be postponed at short notice.
Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about privates in an interview - and now has trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her late Dennis Quaid as an adulterer.
He foams - and strikes back.
Late Rose War on Ex-Marriage Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unpleasant fight with each other - in public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan said, “I have been unfaithful to denial for a long time, and it was very painful.”
The extent of the fraud was only discovered after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan’s press work for her new film “The Women” – telling the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's monstrous," the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, "that Meg is repeating the story of our relationship."
It is also “unfortunate” that the joint 16-year-old son Jack is again “publicly reminded of the pain and upheavals that are a divorce for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became a father of twins.
And so his inductions conclude with the side hurry: "My life goes on anyway.
I’m happy to have a wonderful family that is doing well.”
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than last year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again – this is the result of a study by travel and financial service provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and, following a rise in prices in the first quarter, found a significant decline in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already been reduced.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than last year.
The trend was most noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reason American Express sees the weak dollar price, which has led to a “decreasing travel appetite of American tourists.”
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London are also more affected by the fall in hotel prices than industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne and Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with a rise of 26.3 percent.
In terms of airfares, the trend in the first quarter also showed an upward trend:
Due to the kerosene intoxication, travelers in the economy class had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights were even up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class, price changes were much lower.
In Germany, prices fell even more strongly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had increased by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the fall in prices is on the one hand the decreasing economic growth, explains the company.
Demand is crumbling in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, the open skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe, has increased the competitive pressure.
Signs of the tense situation are the deletion of unprofitable routes with airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, this was 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With one goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes a table leader.
In the case of the Borussia Luhukay still fails to find a functioning eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein increase breaking landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher did not come into the game until late and failed with a lifter to the bar.
His message was accurately formulated, it went over his lips convincingly.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger said in the cabin hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, and he enjoys a higher reputation than many of the late actors.
And so his request was heard in a responsible position.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg’s head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have been similar: Come with gate two!
The implementation was absent.
"Not everything was good to see today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it more relaxed.
The 1-0 (1-0) the Hamburgers owe to the headball hit by Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbachers could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the flash table on the video wall, which identified their club as a class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know that," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the tabular interim testimony stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late-committed accesses - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the scorer Petric and the Jansen, who was recruited by FC Bayern - finds itself slow, but it is not yet able to shine.
“We need more flair and more dribblings,” Jol said.
After the Voting Defeat
On Wall Street there is fear.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to break down by 700 points.
That was the biggest loss in a day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught up again.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer, with a good five percent minus, recorded at 10,579.
The technology exchange Nasdaq was down by more than seven percent at 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which lost just under 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of around 12 percent.
No title could win.
The shares of Goldman Sachs bank declined by almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had participated in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the funds for the purchase of so-called lazy mortgage papers are to be provided.
The sum is not to be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock option notes from the financial companies, which could be redeemed with appropriate price development in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Stock prices in Europe and the USA in the downward trend
Billion-dollar aid to banks in Europe and the US does not address investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the German large bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and tears the dax downwards.
The US index Dow Jones loses despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have plunged the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The share of the Munich real estate financier lost at times three quarters of its value, despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank declined by more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped clearly below the psychologically important 6000-point mark and scored at 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent drop.
Stock markets worldwide fell to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to get the financial markets back on track.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to 10,809.25 points in the first trading hour.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate could follow on October 1.
The other European exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese lead index Nikkei fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 points after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell by 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and closed at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor yielded after announcing a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing perplexity in research: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be quite correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft flew through space.
Due to soon freezing fuel lines, she is now threatened with cold death.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among scientists – the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flying maneuver of space probes, in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has surprised the researchers for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent the way one would expect according to the ancient law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They named him swing-by-anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, might not be quite correct.
The American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
Apparently, it emanates from it an attraction, the effect of which can be observed on other celestial bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it transmits and reflects no electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter accounts for about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists abducted in Egypt should be free again, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
In a shooting before the release, six hostages were reportedly killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists abducted in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports from Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been liberated.
We're just checking their health," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian companions, are well and safe, the Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It was "only about receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men should be detained until the hijackers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of stepfather "leaded to suicide"
The years of abuse by her stepfather have led to a woman killing herself, a court has been reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison after confessing eight cases of sexual abuse.
The Tribunal in Truro learned that he regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle murdered herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her and blindfolded her before engaging in sexual acts while her mother was away to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who worked for the National Trust for a large part of her time, was persecuted by the abuse inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who had been a zealous surfer and cyclist, had been “emotionally dead” since 2006 and “gave up her life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended in this way: “I used to tie her and tie her eyes.”
“I didn’t sexually coerce them.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “They are an extremely strange fetishist and for their victim it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Even worse is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so.”
He added: “I take note of the impact, according to the description of Stephanie’s father and mother, of her act over the years on her daughter.
She would otherwise have been clearly a promising, successful and happy young woman.”
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who lost strictly confidential documents in a train in June, will be charged under the “Public Security Act”.
The man was seconded to the Ministry of Defence when he lost two extremely confidential documents in a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC Defence Correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise for many in Whitehall.
He said: “You would have thought that this would be dealt with internally with the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet.”
The employee whose name cannot be named is charged under section 8.1 of the law, the clause dealing with the safe storage of information.
The Royal Prosecutor’s Office recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police with the most sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he published included classified reviews of Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his house to a secret place.
Housing companies look at B&B costs in the eye
British housing companies could cost more than 80 million pounds in the house after the rescue of Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley’s 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 construction companies
The Director General of the Association of Housing Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was “intolerable” that the companies and their members had to pay.
The 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid when Bradford & Bingley’s loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Program confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing companies were included in this number.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudently.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that every company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies would have to pay about 18% of the costs together.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the interest on the loan will be 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies must raise 81 million pounds for the interest rates of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the director general of the Association of Housing Societies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that behaved prudently during the real estate boom are now being called upon to bear some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records existed in 1945.
“We will be monitoring all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing companies and their members from potentially significant costs.”
Interest rates due in 2009 cover the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest rates will be due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk is 5 pence more expensive per litre
The people of Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm have been conducted.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Former Prime Minister of Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail application by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defenders said the court refused bail regarding the charge of blackmailing 50 million Taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several pending charges of corruption against them.
Sheikh Hasina’s longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in the coming weeks, but her party, the Awami Alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government first grant her unrestricted freedom.
The correspondents say that although she has been granted a detention period to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to remain free if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers state that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Supreme Court.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she doesn't need to be granted a bail because she is already on detention abroad to be treated," her lawyer, Rafique-ul Huq, said in a statement.
We will file a complaint against the court.”
Her lawyers appeal that she needs bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, an Awami Alliance leader said on Sunday.
She was imprisoned last year after the army-backed transitional government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears of the Anti-Polio Initiative in Afghanistan
In the latest anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated due to the violence associated with the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations conducted a vaccination program in six provinces.
However, they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesman, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or obstruct the thousands of vaccination workers.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its lawsuit against the Competition Commission’s decision to reduce its share of the competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competitive Appeals Court has ordered BskyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that the share of BskyBs distorted competition and allowed it to have an unfair influence on the broadcaster ITV.
BskyB acquired its share in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the share of ITV by BskyB gave rise to doubts about the independence of ITV, which prompted the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom’s communications office have spoken out against the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce its share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that it wanted to give up its voting rights.
New Investigation in the U.S. Prosecutor's Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has commissioned a special investigator to investigate the dismissal of the nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, in which the actions of the administration staff were criticized.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been deposed for political reasons.
Specialist investigator Nora Dannehy is now to clarify whether the officers interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in order to obstruct the justice system.
Serious allegations, including criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Department of Justice removed nine U.S. prosecutors from office in December 2006.
At that time, the ministry argued that prosecutors would be dismissed due to poor work performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had not been judged worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to view the dismissals as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the Democrats’ allegations of electoral fraud.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting court cases for the government.
They may be dismissed at any time, but may not be deposed for political reasons.
At the time, the head of the Department of Justice Attorney General Alberto Gonzales was under fire because of the redundancies and ultimately resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also resigned.
In particular, the Inspector General’s report has critically addressed Gonzales’ role by bearing the “main responsibility” for the layoffs, “resigning” his leadership role, and “extraordinarily disinterested” in the process.
Other officials, including former chief adviser to President Bush Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell".
The singer, who will accept his special gold prize during the awards ceremony next week in London, said he was honored to be recognized.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track for Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
“Coldplay” leads the nominations for this year’s awards after being narrowed down in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, Paul Rees, said that there are some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre, and "Bat Out Of Hell" is certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a strong voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was sold in the UK as a single in 1979 and has reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf’s “Bat Out Of Hell” has spent about nine years in the charts and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose real name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was surgery in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute laryngeal inflammation.
Later it became known that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obskure street in town, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side roads and other bypass roads, some of which are famous and others just convenient.
Nevertheless, even for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals, it’s hard to tell where Extra Place is, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is located in East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used road.
There are also no street signs.
It is practically impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean passage to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other admirers is the long-standing neighborhood, which says she is fascinated by the short alley, simply because it is one of the remains of the block’s past.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for protecting and erecting the residential buildings and is responsible for the road, has no interest in getting them.
During a meeting of the Municipal Council’s Land Use Committee this month, representatives of the Municipality and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal for the construction company to purchase the road.
Nevertheless, the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in the municipal council 3.
“Only very little space has remained in the city’s possession and we want Extra Place to continue to belong to the city,” she said.
“There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access to be guaranteed.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would re-pave the small street and set up seats, among other things, for a café to which the company would like to rent out space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was first made public during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it didn’t necessarily want to own it.
“The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this decayed alley and make it a public meeting place,” she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Building Protection Department, said it was actually the city’s desire to sell the street and stressed that the department’s job was to develop rather than manage the real estate.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the street got its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided between his numerous children and a tight strip of land was claimed by none.
The back door of the music club CBGB, the punk rock monument that was closed in 2006, opened to the Extra Place and the street is most certainly known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who had taken the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scraps, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that this public property, as modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged splinter of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called “Jeremiah’s Disappearing New York” (subtitled “The Book of Complaints: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Extinct City”), has published part of the city history conversation about Extra Place that had appeared in the magazine “The New Yorker” in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that remains dark even during the day and is characterized by rusted metal doors of warehouses, closed windows and rain gutters flying past week-old newspapers".
With a few exceptions, the road looked just like this in one evening.
A rat walked through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where today there is a more expensive clothing store.
Graffiti was on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the street could be polished up a bit.
Fields added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the charm of the road in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, humid and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in an English-speaking environment
In this edition of the "Education Watch", Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior researcher in Caliphonic Studies and senior director in the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school selection".
Addressing Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama’s election campaign mentions that “the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students successfully completing school is lower than that of white students” – which is true.
To close this gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends a bilingual transitional period in education for those who are just learning English.
Still, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the gap in school performance.
Take, for example, "Sixth Street Prep", a primary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Still, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-grade students passed the state exam in math at a good level.
Also surprisingly, 93 percent of children from the fourth year of school were rated as good in the English exam.
This astonishing success has been achieved using methods other than those favored by Obama.
The Sixth Street School focuses on review and practice, on constant control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach that education takes in an English-speaking environment, which is exactly what Obama should consider, according to school principal Linda Mikels.
This approach emphasizes the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist classes.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me that the school had a remarkable success with a student who had just come from Mexico. Twelve months later, one would be able to enter the classroom and not recognize him.
“It works,” she said, “it works for us.”
Would Obama take a school like the “Sixth Street Prep” as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school’s achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within its own party (the national image associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education make predictions about Obama’s response uncertain.
While agreeing on the point that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about legislation targeting “only English.”
Instead, he said, “You should make sure your child can speak Spanish.”
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
Oil prices fall as a result of renewed fears about the economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets might not be enough to revive the economy.
Crude futures on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has fallen by more than $20.
In the past two weeks, goods markets have been shaken by both the financial turbulence on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to nearly $90 per barrel this month, then again, as a result of enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
On Monday, investors have shown concern again, despite Congressional representatives having announced they had agreed on a bailout plan this weekend, which should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new worries that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, the Citigroup is to buy up the banking business of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it appears that it has not been possible to revive the mood in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, it is expected that the demand for goods, including oil, will continue to decline.
Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a statement to investors that the forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue to write, that the goods markets will also be affected.
“From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts have corrected their expectations for oil consumption downwards due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in the second quarter
Defendant Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all after running more often than anyone else in the Jets jet over the past eight and a half years.
Then, on Sunday, he saw the second quarter in which the jets turned an unsuccessful game into a triumphal move.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis said.
After a sloppy match between the jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which corresponded to the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre’s pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, it marked the perfect start to an afternoon when their evolving collaboration took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this neighborhood for two more touchdowns, one slipping out as an outside defender and the other 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
“I didn’t put a lot of effort into it,” Coles says about the passes that went to Coles.
"He's a super player.
We voted no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Cole played catching, the defense quarterback Kurt Warner took apart.
Defender Darrelle Revis captured an accidental throw and turned it into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith came to another passport and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss of Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the most insane.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely turned a 20 yard shot to 34 to 0 lead.
These were the most points the jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the jet coach, replied, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
To answer both, because the jets scored 21 points in the third quarter without a single one, Mangini said, “Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were achieved in a short time.”
Rugged Gebrselassie hits its world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has once again shown why some consider him to be the best long-distance runner of all time, after breaking his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to make the 42.2-kilometer route in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has thus set his 26th world record in his versatile career, in which he has achieved at least one world championship title or set a world record on every track from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing that air pollution might exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in the sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won at an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since railroad runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya switched to long distances, the record time for marathon has fallen by more than 2 minutes in the last 10 years, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Apparently, he came back refreshed after a break and not rusted.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great.”
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rival from East Africa - for orchestrating his races excessively, avoiding many of the world's best marathon stars in general, relying too much on the race leaders as if it were a railroad race, and setting world records on the competition.
But this criticism hardly harms the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the center of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers had slowed down.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his last start to break up with Kwambai, who arrived second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems that were described as a back injury, but she recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She has cleverly planned her run by first tearing out a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners, but overtaking after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa from Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop from Kenya arrived third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardship in the life of the black population, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden among the sprawlings of the amusement parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, noisy and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first wholly black city in the country and hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three crocket courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Today it is a pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! festival in Eatonville to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet the city that describes it – and which made it a tourist destination by introducing it to the Florida Travel Guide, which was produced by the federal writers’ project during the time of the depression – is and remains, in many ways, a very special place.
Eatonville is as independent, sophisticated and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t know what he misses.”
Even nowadays, in a year when a black presidential candidacy is calling for Senator Barack Obama to talk openly about race relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
“We are very attentive to how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth to a resident of the city and a community member of the city’s oldest church.
It has to be true.”
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a community of almost 2,400 inhabitants, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other hand, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural South, which has its roots in American slavery.
Not surprisingly, residents here are both proud and watchful.
And so the concerns about Eatonville's image actually started with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that leads through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Cheeky like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private matters.
"Away from the road to the left," she wrote, "is the brown-white-painted modern school, with its well-groomed gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, though he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells drinks of any kind and what-always fits in with classrooms.”
In just a few hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
“Zora described things the way they were,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about her beauty, which were full of sexual allusions.
She added, “Some people didn’t like this.”
Hurtson is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came to town, she usually did so without warning, in a noisy Chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that even today imagines something of her venerable style of dress.
According to Mr. Franklin, most residents were fascinated, while many despised them.
“People were always glad to see Zora,” said Mr. Franklin.
But “she never stayed too long,” he added as he rocked in his chair, on a back-facing terrace overlooking the Sabelia Lake, where Hurston was most likely baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of stock.
Along with most of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville there was no great memorial, no public readings in large style.
“I don’t think they understood their contribution to the world or their legacy at all,” says Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography about Hurston published in 2003.
The turnaround came in the 80s.
Orange County authorities wanted to lay a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the town's slow two-lane main road.
Orlando’s suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white boys often came and they threw oranges and stuff at the secluded people,” Mr. Franklin said.
“There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, Hurston, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, questioned the Supreme Court’s demand to force integration by calling Brown’s decision against the school council “offensive rather than respectful of my race.”
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
“Black children were used to being hugged – I remember – one hugged his teacher in the morning and one hugged his teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
This could be maintained, she added, until teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide," Mrs. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped create space for more Zora Neale Hurston's -- black writers, actors, and artists who disregarded prejudice, as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, "How can anyone deny the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker set out for Hurston's nameless tomb and began fighting for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much acclaimed Hurston biography of Robert E. Hemenway was found on the bookshelves, and again made it a part of the American literary canon.
The highway project came at a time when Eatonville’s most famous daughter once again stood in the public light.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston Festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at peak speed, aroused real public pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project has contributed to a change in the city’s self-image.
There were more and more concierges, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to reappreciate the past.
Eatonville was included in the nationwide historical register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a peculiarity in Florida: only 6 miles from Orlando city centre, it can sometimes feel like a back road in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It's 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, permission is required in advance and certain things – such as the wall painting of Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and depicting black men in the field work – may not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a courageous, confident teacher with a penchant for dark red, still fear that her shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston Festival got bigger, an increased degree of homeland pride was also born.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and as proud, creative and diligent, silly and mixed up as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It is the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s nephew, the 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city administration or the police, who could use some help, according to him.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to correctly describe Eatonville.
“Most of the people who drive through here will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,” Alondra Kenon said on a Sunday after the church.
“But if you actually stop and look at its history for a moment, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York we speak fluent financial Latin.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If Manhattan tourists kept away from Times Square’s newspaper stalls and huge television screens, they wouldn’t even realize they were in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund administrators who have the monopoly in New York, have had the worst horror workday on a daily basis since the 1929 stock market crash.
The suppliers still push the metal tea wagons along sidewalks with loud rattles and carry trays loaded with muffins for breakfast sessions.
Latinos are still shuffling between apartments, like human packed animals loaded with around 50 ironed t-shirts hanging on a yoke-like rod lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting for their breakfast bagel at food stalls on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn’t feel like a crisis at all until I decided to open a new savings account Thursday afternoon due to all the doomsday talk.
Although I had decided to put my mandatory course on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cash desks to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service desk where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for the way to Macy’s department store and where new customers open accounts.
Most in front of me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with a license," were queuing for the same reason as I was.
Unlike me, however, they had already raised their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuteed, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken money from so-called Thrifts (a little like a construction fund), cooperative banks, and those local savings banks that only have branches in one state, saying they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went silently bankrupt.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a $327 billion investment bank, went into bankruptcy management and as last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, Wachovia, another $440 billion savings bank, was looking for a rescuing buyer.
Fearing another collapse, the office and shop employees who stood before me brought their cashes to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of the Wall Street bailouts.
Normal New Yorkers have acquired fluent financial latin in recent weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese stock market was so familiar with Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt and their lean-looking chairman Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, around the 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block, got rid of our usual conversation topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
“I now have all my savings in money market funds,” she told me after my visit to the bank.
“I changed, I don’t take risks anymore.”
Muslim graves desecrated in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-wing member of the Austrian Right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of the Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, will take part in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 to represent the organization "Cities Against Islamization".
They carry signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed with a red line.
The police accuse right-wing extremists of grave desecration at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend at which extreme right-wing parties report significant gains in the country’s parliamentary elections.
On the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves in the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the tombs, but criminal officials consider this an attempt to obscure the motives of the extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shaken” by the news of the grave desecration that took place as the religious month of Muslim Ramadan nears its end.
At the same time, there is a round of conscience research in Austria, after the country slipped to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that received nearly 30% of the votes, advocated a strict anti-immigrant law in their campaign and some of their electoral slogans were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, who won 18% of the vote, advocated a ban on headscarves and burkas and even expressed his aversion to food generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the election, stating that the far right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters worried about their future in the European Union.
Expatriate travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, was banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted last Thursday to impose a travel ban after presenting evidence to judges of Glitter’s criminal charges of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, the real name of Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford District Court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court of Justice said: "On Thursday, September 25, Kent Police requested permission from the Ashford District Court to prevent Mr. Paul Glad from travelling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present."
As required by the register of sex offenders, Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his planned departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could lead to a prison sentence of 5 years.
Police in Kent said they would not discuss individual cases or glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent’s police unit said: “The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad.”
“In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks.”
“It is the primary concern of Kent police to protect Kent residents, and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country to minimize any risk that may be posed to the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing 2 girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he was not comfortable and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border officials insisted that he return to the UK.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 in Heathrow on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in West London, as Scotland Yard had successfully requested permission to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been imprisoned in the UK for 4 months for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
“I receive the master behind the stage to capture his character,” said Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who renounce concentration and devote themselves to interpretation to get a relaxed look as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are alien to the audience, I know when I can find the depth of a stolen look or expression of the hands that are concerned because they are not going to enter the stage.
In his project ‘Flamenco-people’ the German photographer Günter Bauer presents a variety of theatrical productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was still little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation at different levels.
The exhibition, which is part of the programme of Flamenco’s Month of Photography, “reflects the international importance of Flamenco, which is growing from day to day,” explains the artist, making it clear that “Flamenco-people” can be any person, but when you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
Quite normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy and thus to move the audience on stage.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you do not have to take photos on stage.
Her personality and character is in her heart.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.
Inspired by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer embarked on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the camera's image sorting function and the existing material, images were created that remind of classical photography.
The use of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundation of the image, giving the image the modernity and the idea of how the farmer understands Flamenco: "Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day".
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something that becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the next time in the gallery of El Fotómata.
Famous figures in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of almost seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as a ‘portraits of the veterans of the sport’ (‘SportARTproject’).
Although the concepts of the project ‘Flamenco-people’ are different, I really like to photograph people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer period of time.
I think that in the field of photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or come across people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
The collection of today’s flamenco portraits is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, located in the street called la calle de la Mata and parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. You can visit the exhibition until October 16.
Vargas Llosa admits that the Roma he is writing is "an audacity."
He does not yet know where the novel's plot takes place and what it is about, but Mario Vargas Llosa is persistently trying to advance the project he is working on, a novel with protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he’s working on is “an audacity” and “everything indicates that he doesn’t have to write the novel.”
“If I were mindful, I wouldn’t have done it, but I’ll do it and hope to finish the novel someday,” he concluded his participation at the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days he saw hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of ‘La ciudad y los perros’ was one of the most outstanding figures at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival’s premium and gave his voice to most of the audience, is compared to the old edition of Our Mutual Friend and can be seen at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, who realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to revisit everything: how his vocation to literature was born out of 'extraordinary adventure', from 'joy at reading', and from 'the desire to experience' the whole of his work.
The Hispano-American novelist acknowledged that there is “no way” to measure and how to know whether books change life, “but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,” Vargas Llosa stressed, who claims that it is “letting out” the responsibilities of writers, and “letting them apart” the responsibilities that make them more apt.
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather didn’t play along: bullfighting festivals were partially cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the square was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival, which was to conclude the festival in Pozoblanco, was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, the organizer, with the consent of Fermin Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was subjected to volatile weather, which is why two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matadore group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Dias and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed after leaving the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening Alejandro Talavante met two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had done more by galloping than by his bullfighting skills.
And even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After fighting so badly, a large part of the audience responded in his second fight with buh-calls.
In Alava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armicone (Sava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, and they took the flight.
It looked like they didn’t have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
The police pursued her and arrested one of the drivers, the man who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., according to the Interior Ministry of the Basque State.
The detainee was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officials of the traffic police of the region of Alava had already completed the traffic control on the N-1 and drove past the urban area of Armicone.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began to chase the car until after a few kilometers the car stopped at the edge of the road, and at that moment the drivers got out of the car to escape over a country road into a forested area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally picked up one of the two. In the car, a Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was confiscated by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to further police stations for precise laboratory analysis and for weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was ‘doubled’, so that it did not correspond to the license plate indicated in the car papers, which is why an additional arrest was made for counterfeiting official documents.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza continues the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, was able to flee, but also to determine the origin of the drugs seized.
The 28-year-old A. A. J., who was arrested, was taken to a police station for interrogation and will be brought to the prison judge for the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear was arrested for driving under the action of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda in the Melrose Place series, was arrested in Santa Barbara, California, this weekend for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A Witness watched as she tried to leave her parking space in Montecito in a strange way, a spokeswoman for the California traffic police told People magazine.
The witness told me in detail that Locklear “squeezed through the accelerator after 4:30 p.m. and made a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forwards out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses several times.”
A little later, the witness, who in the beginning probably had not recognized the actress, saw Locklear stopping on a nearby street and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she was “fearful of Locklears.”
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing across the street and thereby blocking traffic.
‘She seemed to be disoriented,’ so they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress showed herself cooperatively, excessive alcohol consumption was ruled out from the very first moment. "After the officials' first observations, we believe Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug," the spokesperson said.
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an indeterminate substance that could not be determined and was sent to a local detention centre around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was released from the clinic in Arizona, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the Andalusian Union of the United Left be responsible for the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the head coordinator of the VL and United Left MP, today assured that the regional education association will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sports in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing business with family members.
“In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one to take responsibility for it,” Llamazares pointed out, “what course of action the party must take in relation to the city council of Seville.”
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the need for “transparency” in the possible investigations of the rule violations that Silva may have begun: “The VL has always insisted that such cases get maximum transparency.”
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has “a strict ethical code for all public offices.”
'Sangre de mayo': Book of Heroes by Garci
Inspired by ‘Episodios Nacionales’ by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in ‘Sangre de mayo’ presents the revised version of the famous Spanish uprising against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros in investment for the shooting.
In this way, the cineast has tried to 'represent a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he has always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarráa at the beginning of a long list of performers.
'Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later on Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, great fan of Galdós literature, assures that thanks to this filming, his ‘children’ dream’ came true. This he owed to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago by the Autonomous Community of Madrid to shoot a memorial film for the second century celebration on 2 November in Madrid. Especially because the story was based on the mission of ‘Episodios Naguirre.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was provided by the Madrid Autonomous Community for filming, offers Garci, as he added, the "unique possibility" by means of decorations and appropriate clothing to represent the image of "confused Spain, which selected the wrong leader for the fight, because the people had been put behind by the struggle for independence and under the rule of Ferdinand the VII."
However, the Cineast regrets that the financing could not be expected as with Alatriste or Los Fantasmas de Goya (twice as high as with Sangre de Mayo), so some scenes from the script with Horacio Valcárcel, with whom Garci worked almost his entire career, could not be filmed.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in 'Volver a empezar', has contributed through his usual way of working: he put himself on the stage to the actors, with whom one must first rehearse before starting to shoot and for those who had not done casting, he appeared 'humiliating' and giving respect, 'to know what is happening in the cinema, to be part of the profession of the film director, to know
Many actors he encounters in ‘Sangre de mayo’ have to repeat in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrasaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, an Oscar nominee in four nominations (one of which he has won), is of the opinion and reassured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year represents a young generation of Spanish filmography, neither ‘Sangre de mayo’, nor ‘Siete mesas de billar francés’ and finally not the selected film ‘Los cirassegole’.
Garci does not expect any awards for this film.
“In the beginning you think you’re working for the offspring, later you realize it’s only for thriving, and now you’re satisfied if you’ve made another movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of working.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville worships a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: Her father was Catalan (Florena Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the district of Triana and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted the free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe in the period between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.”
"We are not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her esprit," said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance principles have helped me a lot in Flamenco.
For example, ‘the dance of the butterfly’ seemed to me like Guajira, or ‘the dance of the snake’ like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I’ve been told that my dancing is also in this aesthetic realm,” she claims.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in La puerta abierta; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with one of her ex-students.
Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work, and I am very honored."
The production also counts on musical composition and the guitarists Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the vocals of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Jáarez, he 'takes over the role of the artist.
This work also tells in a certain way about this woman’s life, which became known in places as far away as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, although she normally lived in London.
“I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have a huge influence on a certain epoch and whose works are no longer appreciated and therefore even less appreciated today,” Bayón claims.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Theater Lope de Vega.
The publication of the book 'Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of ‘Diario de un poeta recién casado’ at the Saint Stephen’s Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, provides an appropriate atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council of Culture, to celebrate the ‘Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón’s Jubilee of the Fifth (2006-2008).
Thus, 'the Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition 'Juan Ramón Jiménez: 'Aquel chopo de luz', which was now presented in the course of the Andalusia
The Andalusian Council of Culture has also received eight hundred copies of the Diario de un poeta recién casado, published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The aim is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The U.S. can’t imagine itself without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.
This phrase comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in 'Sensation Reporter', and from the then prevailing notion of U.S. cinema, which was abandoned, from all over America to Newman with his exciting notion and followed it.
Look at how much it cost him to win the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Nevertheless, it was a big blow for everyone.
“What one feels at times is much more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” said Robert Redford, crying, “my life and my country were the greatest messes of his life.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculed or exaggerated.
As the ‘father’ of the cinema and the homeland, he died at a sad moment when there is fear of terrorists and the market collapse, where the depressed self-esteem of Americans is in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity.
If there are few people who can be admired in this difficult time without virtue, you don’t necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official enemy of Richard Nixon and, like various losses, suffered both profits: from the foundation dedicated to the fight against drugs and founded in honor of his son from his first marriage, who died of overdose, to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
All this is a gift for the country, where it took him a lot of effort to assert himself against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of amazement beats up above Hollywood without regard for nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person died, but the whole era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said that working with Newman was no more or no less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the evil boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"The greatest of all of us has left us," George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dare to live the way Paul Newman lived, said.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there’s someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal, although there were certainly many opportunities not to be.
“Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have fillet at home?” he joked.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud as he was of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympics, the streets in Madrid are deficient.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, ‘Are we prepared for that?’
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
It was called a perfect road, and in my opinion, it was the worst road with everything there was.
Of course, this is a lot of nonsense, if you would pay attention to the evaluation and I could check it if clearly something like that had not come through.
But let’s go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket picking, which allows you to go first.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, they should also give you everything (including chip to avoid traffic jams on the road).
I don't think so.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists in going there only because of it) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only in the size 'S' (a second nonsense because I need the size XL)
Where do we live?
Or is it that after the crisis, it was decided to buy only small, much cheaper shirts from less fabric?
So, things like this are a little bit compared to the days on the road.
Apart from having to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11,000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we hadn’t left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but getting them back would be more difficult.
In addition, it looked like rain in these 40 minutes, so that there was a temptation to organize a popular uprising and raid the cottage.
I think some 500 people will certainly have pneumonia tomorrow and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip I got, I can already imagine that the output was mislabeled.
Of course, if you asked me about a perfect road, I would never think of that road.
So I think we’ll be dreaming for a long time about a city that’s well prepared for the Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the Emerging Technology Conference, hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of doing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, it’s a route planner to move on the company’s campus).
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this ‘receptionist’ can recognize how many people are in the room, who they are, and even remember how they were dressed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also classify the attendees into the groups after the conversations.
In the presentation video, 'the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that that person is not a part of the group that is talking to her, and that she is not a company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and answers that she will listen soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
That is certainly the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, such as the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week, people spoke very superficially about Microsoft’s strategy change.
Windows 7 will be faster and will not have as many embedded programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if computers were equipped with what is most needed, instead of filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster.
Everything is just a statement, considering that Microsoft added some feature and ‘extras’ in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worthwhile
Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, that was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
A lot of people said that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to sharing something with his mother-in-law.
That's right.
The system will never disappear, but you have to think of your ‘death’, not as an absolute, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirmation of this idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system each time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time browsing than in the surroundings of the 'windows'.
What is half of the applications in the computer used for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft’s interest is more in integrating its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need it, without a doubt, and I'll give you a small example of that.
I took the photo of this place in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees at the beginning of the month.
A sign is attached to the soft drinks machine: 'Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft used Google for research on the web.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of Windows Mobile 7 is in delay.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the opportunity to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the market at the same time.
Every day, the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhone are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso had it in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had it in ‘Blood Diamond’ by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in ‘The Godfather’ by Francis Ford Coppola.
When we begin to enumerate the countless star appearances, we can fall back on the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard, who had lifted heavy weights in a walking circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and tailored.
The English-speaking people call it 'tank', but Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles surpasses all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called 'Marcel' in the narrow circle, the legend tells that the name is associated with sport and originated from boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out because of its excellent cotton, because of its distinctive unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that these T-shirts have as detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of ‘tanks’.
They also have College Sweatshirts, Boxer Retro, Cardigans and Cashmere, Cotton Pants, Striped T-Shirts, Babies, Mini Shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is very unfortunate to use them as underwear.
They're very attractive.
“I want to be a young mother; I don’t worry about the candidate.”
Her great appearance with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite but full of joie de vivre.
Currently, the Gruz siblings take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris in the promotion of the company Mango, relocating there and also making the presentation of the most important awards in fashion sponsored by the Spanish fashion house.
Compassionate and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season that my sister Penélope and I have designed for Mango, I have also attended the presentation of the second edition of Mango Fashion Awards and participated in the dinner in Valentino’s honor.
A very intensive working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for mango?
My sister, both I and I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50s and 60s; there we find many ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women dressed as they combine their clothes, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think yes, but after all, everything comes together in one and these areas have many things in common.
Ever since I was a child, I’ve been fascinated by the clothes; I always wanted to go to my grandmother to crawl around in my aunt’s wardrobe and see her clothes.
That was great, almost better than going to an amusement park.
Even later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like to have our own style in class and at rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real acting role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, much respect for the costume designer and their professionalism.
You recently turned 30, didn't you fall into a crisis?
Oh, yeah.
I feel better than ever when I’m 30 years old.
I think the woman becomes mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I’ve done the things I’ve wanted to do since I was a kid, and that has given me a lot of inner joy.
So you're thinking of becoming a mother, aren't you?
For a long time I have known that I am going to be a mother because my body demands this, and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to miss that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I am not worried.
I will give my child great feelings of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as film art is concerned, you keep an eye on the work that you participated in and that was shot last year.
That is exactly the way it is and I very much want it to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediately.
I very much hope that ‘La’ltima hora’ and ‘En busca de la tumba de Cristo’ will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how they like you
A couple of days ago, you appeared on the walkway with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It’s not that I went on the walkway to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, just called me and invited me to London to participate in a parade for her organization’s “Women for a Better World” charity event and the clothes we show. I know that two pieces of clothing from our collection for mango have been auctioned off to collect the money for Naomi’s NGO.
People do not know Naomi’s good heart.
A lot of things are told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they're not right.
Nevertheless, I will support this good thing in which she is involved.
She asked me to take part in the parade for this generous thing, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will too.
To support women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
Drivers who can relapse due to alcohol levels will have to install the ‘alcolock’.
The authority orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for the alcohol level, install in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in the drunk state.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General. According to their data, this is a pilot project that will last for a year.
The purpose is to rehabilitate the driver, which is why he gets a course for re-educating traffic behavior.
In addition to the Prosecutor General’s Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for Automotive Safety will also participate.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of drivers who were reported more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol again sat at the wheel.
The 'alcolock' would prevent this because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart when the driver has done alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected that is higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the penalty.
In this context, a study conducted in the U.S. in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behavior before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, a legal reform can be implemented by the ordinary way, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is required, which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
Still, the device is available in the Spanish markets, in no store, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which is proposing to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without peep-toes
With British punctuality, at 17:40, at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport landed the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which Prince and Princess of Asturias travelled.
The sun went down, but its rays still forced to use the hand as an umbrella to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
Directly on the Gangway: the Spanish Ambassador and other authorities
A few hours earlier, I had asked a taxi driver on the road if he knew that the Prince and Princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so you can't take people at the airport at this time.
No, she's the Spaniard, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good.
But the Mexican press knows who the prince and princess of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection from 27 Marines, who are handing out salves of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long wind-laid hair, without ordinary peep-toes, perhaps was told that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before they enter the room, they smile and are prepared for the photographers where the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, awaits a reporter from Mexican television who likes to make jokes.
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no much better fashion designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition 'el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' for the promotion and international enhancement of young fashion talents.
This will be awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the company's second largest store in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The largest business is in London.
So many events have happened that one would like to thank the fashion designer Valentino for his chair of the jury at the competition, all ending with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
In the vicinity of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart broken by the pain that his brother recently died, tears together. He put on the suit from the fashion house and put on some ELAH jewellery that was breathtaking. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall, and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the House of Mango, welcomed the guests and was such a cavalier that he ended up with the Baron of Red Shield without jackets, for they borrowed jackets from the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has rushed to the shop and had a pants and a shirt on, which she modelled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night stroll through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got excited, remembered the old times, grabbed a bar and made a kind of plow.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the palace premises, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the phone.
The next morning we were able to look forward to the presence of Oliver Martinez, a personality who always evokes a stormy excitement, and to Jon Travolta, who, upon his arrival (with his own bedspreads and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 Rat against Stress
There are not 1000, but one more way to forget about chaotic everyday life.
And although there are few, they are all collected in a book that tells you how to relax. The book comes to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse seems the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that demands of current life.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of shutting down the world of work.
However, the number increases, no more and no less, to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott in the book presents the entire list of options adapted to each individual’s taste and time.
The work against stress is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and so the calm that the book conveys comes to the bookstores of Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as the workplace by means of personal contacts, this handbook disproves such faith.
In addition, the methods are offered, how to stay in touch with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation.
If the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, then the moment has come to sit on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who talk during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be frightened, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking during sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you were talking at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in life, for example, during high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is not a single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, relationships are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic at night, Enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for this.
As we mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overload.
In any case, this is a little researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak quietly in individual words, whisper or it may be quite an opposite (screaming, crying, long discussions).
In cases where the utterance is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and get advice from a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes anxiety and comes about in this way.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, whether it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is carry out a series of simple preventive measures:
Try not to arouse the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet game for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are horrible and a bit too wild.
For the nervous children who are recommended to relax, relaxation methods can be used to help them get some inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep quietly.
Once speaking occurs in sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and the next day he will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Even though the child speaks, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if it appears to be scared after a couple of appearances, it is recommended to seek advice or find out the reason the child is afraid.
If they understand what it says (which isn’t so common), the child won’t put pressure on them to conduct an interrogation and get more information out.
So you will not be able to achieve anything with it, because when the child sleeps, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you will hear what it says, but you won’t know what it’s dreaming about and why it’s saying that’s why be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn’t tell the child that you hear it at night and know its secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a lot of fear.
So, don’t worry, it’s nothing bad, it’s a moment that only takes a few minutes.
Illhouses... at last
After a long thirsty stretch, Illhäuser is finally back on track for success.
Without much effort, the yellow blacks scored numerous goals and managed to implement one of them, thus winning the game.
The pace of this encounter, at which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long shot was just past the corner, Illhäuser was to dominate the game with ease, and it was possible to alternately only Fonderflick with a long shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the foot tip to challenge the defense of Denmark.
The opposing team blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm.
The start of the second half should be decisive with two goals initially won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately thereafter with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who was exactly right to take back a ball that had been defeated by Diebold in a first attempt.
But the ill-housed scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, which meant that his teammates had to continue to play in numbers.
Denmark, however, did not take advantage of this and did not pose any major problems to an Illhaeusian eleven, which only retreated a little to 'compress' their defense, except in the very last seconds of the game, in which the ball passed very close to the latte after a major mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
Given the determined attitude of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French President decided to meet Tuesday morning in the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère to meet with their representatives there.
The latter promised to welcome him “with a constructive spirit” and hoped he would come up with “concrete proposals.”
The President’s visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the Crisis Committee, founded by the Breton fishermen, to enforce measures in the face of the extreme rise in diesel prices, which has reached a record value of on average above 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elyséepalast’s spokesman David Martinon, “the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the workplace conditions and the pay of seafarers.”
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in Morbihan and Calvado, causing traffic jams of almost ten kilometers.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Ile did not stop.
The Quiberon peninsula was demarcated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning tires and pallets from the early morning before the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fish cutters did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
In the evening, the fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique dissolved the blockade of the major Total refinery in Donges.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the course of the meeting at the Ministry on Wednesday before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the Guilvinec Crisis Committee has to decide on the reactions to the movement and on its participation in the discussion planned by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those in charge of the National Fisheries Committee who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who don’t pay taxes on diesel currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they think that a boat’s profitability limit can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
Butch Cassidy and the Kid died at the age of 83 from cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes said goodbye to the cinematic legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer meets its supply forecasts for 2008
This year, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer expects 215 delivered aircraft, despite the impending recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is meeting its 2008 delivery forecasts with 215 delivered aircraft, said President Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects a lot from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider surrendering more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering handing over more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced to it.
AIG is ready to drive the sale of much of its businesses, beyond its life insurance on an international level and its retirement provision in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to review possible sales.
At the AIG no confirmation could be obtained.
AIG’s potential assets include its aircraft leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in reinsurance Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and private equity investments.
With regard to these sales, no final decision has been taken, FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as soon as possible to repay the loans of over 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has granted it, also at the risk of the US authorities receiving 80% of their capital and the current shareholders being lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historic Paris of the Historic Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported on Monday, after the Chamber of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save the banks, a historic case of prices: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped by 777.68 points to 10.365.45 points.
As far as the points are concerned, the strongest case of its history (684.81 points) had been recorded previously on 17 September 2001, the day of the trade decline following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
According to the final dropping figures, the Nasdag index, mainly related to technology, fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widespread Standard&Poors 500 index by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to save the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which would once again allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which had already been hit at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 votes in favour, MEPs denied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad picture that shows Congress is unable to accept a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“This shows how much the market counted on this plan,” she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come “too late.”
“If the project is actually doomed to failure (...), it will soon be the task of the Fed (the U.S. Central Bank) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further restrict credit conditions,” warned Brian Bethune, head of economics at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza stressed, emphasizing even more the sense of urgency that “every day that passes will bring about the ruin of a financial enterprise” in the United States.
After the Washington Mutual bankruptcy on Friday, the U.S. authorities planned to buy up Wachovia’s banking business through its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets are facing “not just an American but a global crisis,” added FTN Financial analyst.
The market for basic goods has grown sharply.
Revenue from the Treasury within ten years fell from 3.632% to 3.827% on Friday evening, and revenue within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Obama wins by points in first TV duel
The first debate between the two White House candidates on Friday was followed by another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs announced their own victory in this television duel, which was to be pursued by one-third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain’s performance, though quite decent, wasn’t “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop his drop in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, which released an opinion poll on Saturday stating Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, those that matter now, Obama came out of the polls with 39% as winners, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as winners.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected of his competitor Joseph Biden in the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts, but this weekend she warned Bill Clinton.
Seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to put his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy to the forefront, clearly emphasizing his opponent’s “naiveness” to these issues that were the focus of this first television duel.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he stressed several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to become president,” he added.
An attack point that has been preached in Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama said he represents the future.
He spoke briefly and precisely, without getting out of control.
He brought his ability to make good decisions and to renew the image the world has of the United States.
“McCain still hasn’t understood, but Obama already,” Obama said in a Democrat campaign this weekend, against accusing Republicans of not grasping the full scale of the crisis that is burdening the “American from the street.”
“During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in a flooding rain at an election event in North Carolina.
He didn’t even mention the words “middle-sized” or “workers.” The financial crisis gives Obama a clear advantage, which Americans consider most appropriate to save the economy even on the brink of the abyss.
“Next week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is “the final verdict of an eight-year poor economic policy that has been implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
After reaffirming that he would even manage to cut taxes on 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energies, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were top priorities for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates deliberately elaborated on the $700 billion plan to save the financial market, which was approved by Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
“Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?”
Young people and opposition protested on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening in order to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered in the Minsk marketplace on Sunday night after polling stations closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results had yet been announced, numerous youths had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: “The dictator should resign.”
Some admit that they didn’t vote at all: ‘What good is it if they do what they want with my voice,’ says one teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the non-issue of visas for 40 leading Belarusian personalities and the cessation of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
“We were expelled from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count,” regretted Juri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous union of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkiewitsch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it matters who counts the votes, and with us this is the executive.
If members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean broadcasting time on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
So the opposition is guilty of meddling in the political game, because “the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, falls into a crisis and we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that voter turnout numbers seem too high, and that the extension of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
“Have you noticed that an election has taken place?” asks Social Democrat leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
No one was in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in Parliament, those who are most likely to be in line with the government's ideas."
The silence of the night sinks back over October Square.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
Conversation - The Blood That Has Been Safe Again
Hema-Quebec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, for Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, it has regained the public's confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
It is known that the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross’s blood donation service during the 1980s were contaminated with the HI virus and the hepatitis C virus.
In the face of this drama and public dissatisfaction, in February 1994, the Government of Canada initiated a public investigation, led by Judge Horace Krever, aimed to shed light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy, and to draw up guidelines to prevent a further disaster of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still hesitant to report, several provinces set up a committee to develop a new system for managing canned blood in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
According to reports by Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to provide for the other provinces and the two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Quebec began its work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood-conserving system in Quebec, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood canned people and through the work in this field over the following years, we have regained the public’s confidence,’ she says, before proudly stressing that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population had Quebec’s confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in mind that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Hema-Quebec has been acting according to the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the appearance of numerous cases of the human form of bovine madness in Europe, a new type of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says this woman, who has been in charge since its inception in 1998.
"And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we referred to one of the main guidelines of Krever and Gélineau’s reports, which states that exclusion measures are applied if one does not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is evidently the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself as a degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
Thus, in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Now, a few years ago, there was no doubt that this disease was transmitted through the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied does make sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which allow the presence of the virus itself directly in the donor’s blood, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between when the person was infected and when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to less than a week.
Thus, the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and one could not detect it, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, it means distributing 12 million canned blood before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 canned blood each year, it would take more than 24 years for a case of HIV to be transmitted via a canned bloodstream.
I believe that these days you can feel comfortable when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health," says Hema-Quebec's chief executive.
“Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can enter the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by insects through the blood.
We need to continuously monitor,” Dr. Décary continues, before stressing that Hema-Quebec must provide adequate care in addition to safe care.
“The demand is increasing as the population ages.
Because cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also affects the blood-donor network, which on average only includes 3% of Quebec’s blood-donor population.”
Every healthy person who is 18 years or older and meets the aptitude criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have, for example, AIDS or malaria, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is widespread are excluded from blood donation for one year.
“With these 3%, we manage to get an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Lack of supplies is very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It’s hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly, to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic these days that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Quebec provides not only blood but also human tissue, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively in severe fire injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before interim storage at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec’s only public cord blood bank.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, contains blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to lose more than a thousand annually.
"We should probably start making it available for transplants at the beginning of next year," Dr. Décary continues, who describes this program of umbilical cord blood loss as very popular.
“Many mothers are convinced they don’t have access to it because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all Quebec hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal’s Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the USL first league elimination matches thanks to a 3-to-1 victory (4-to-3 with all goals) against the Seattle Sounders yesterday at the second and quarter-final match at the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without goals for both sides, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other goals for the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to stand in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let’s remember that on Friday’s first game of the pre-replay series Impact, the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle had a 2-to-1 defeat.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
Saturday night, Thunder was able to compensate for a 3-to-1 deficit in Minnesota by a 4-to-3 win, but the Whitecaps nonetheless entered the semi-finals with a total goal ratio of 5-to-4.
Impact will have to face the whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be set today.
In short - Siegestor by Kovalev
The Canadian team’s number one trio is ready to start the season.
Last night, the unit formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrej Kostitsyn drove the attack on the Florida Panthers with a storm fire, resulting in a 3-to-2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, shot a goal, Plekanec delivered two templates and Kovalev turned a pass into this victory game, the fourth of the tricolors into six preparatory games.
Kovalev scored the victory by shooting the only goal of the whole shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian said.
I need another game to make me feel good.”
“He’s been fixating too much on it in the first half,” said Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received a stormy applause.”
Charest relies on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out initiating elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general assembly of the liberal party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new health minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today’s partial election.
“Shifting the course of our last major border in the North”: This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday by visual means at the General Assembly of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
Three huge screens featured spectacular images of hydropower plants, mines, Quebec in Google Maps, maps, etc.
Much like during the election period.
To the press, by the way, the prime minister refused to rule out that he will hold the elections this fall, even though he announced that his schedule was very busy.
The ‘Plan Nord’ is the fourth element of a ‘vision’ that the Prime Minister allegedly has for Quebec, namely that of a ‘new economic area’ that provides for an agreement with France on labor, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although it has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches lately, the opening of the North - the northern area at the 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is “a jewel of enormous potential,” but did not mention a date, investment sums, or precise priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some prospects of what could be worked on: especially on water energy, on the forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Mr. Charests, the north has “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds.”
This ‘area twice as large as France’ is near us, is in Quebec.
It’s not just near us, it’s within us,” he stressed, as to clearly show that he seeks to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown a lot through its connection with the north, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abitibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
“It’s ours, it’s our future,” he added after taking a theatrical break to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always called for, the prime minister told the press.
“This is a traditional stance that all governments followed.
There is a border line where there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity arises I will take this position again on behalf of the government," he said.
“We need to rethink our vision of the North with climate change,” he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be accessible year-round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister believes that it is a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the land, the indigenous people, and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Quebec government would handle them very carefully, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the boys.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pecist MP of Ungava), have already started discussions with about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee led by Benoit Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large assembly, ‘not necessarily a summit’, but an opportunity where ‘one will come up with a common vision’.
The development of the North will also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be “discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this 'vision' as a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
“Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethinked to turn the challenges into new growth and development chants.
By the way, this was one of the repeatedly raised topics of the weekend, which was opened on Friday with a large cocktail party to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s takeover of the party leadership.
One of the adopted decisions envisages renaming the Beauharnois power plant to Adélard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who achieved the silent revolution and nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,” Jean Charest said.
To the press, he referred to another, this time conservative, project, namely the programme Roads to the North by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower dam, Mr Charest stresses that its commissioning is planned for 2012.
"That remains among us, but I intend to be there," he entrusted to his party members, which evoked in those applause storms.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly 2009, has not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him by law.
However, he stresses that his schedule is full, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The General Assembly this weekend provided the Liberal Party leader with a platform of nationalist plans, especially of ‘constitutional goals’, which were readily adopted: the PLQ particularly calls for the recognition of the ‘speciality of Quebec’ in the constitution.
She also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to veto Quebec’s decisions.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the North Plan were taken up with scepticism.
The head of the Québécois Party, Pauline Marois, has re-emphasized the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, when she came to power in 2003, the liberal government refrained from applying them.
If she had done so, ‘we would have gone much further today’, Ms. Marois judged alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Francoise Mercure.
The ADQ has expressed its support for the government’s adoption of a North Plan.
“But what we want is that this is not just a big show,” said party leader Sébastien Proulx in representation for Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonored country
Mr. Vic Toews, former Justice Minister (what irony) in the Harper cabinet it was last summer who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was a “shame” for Canada.
This woman, who has waged a never-ending fight for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover it with disgrace, says as much about the people around the prime minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one from all the countries concerned who has not brought home her compatriot who was captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when the things happened that are being blamed on him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and has a child soldier swept away under inhumane conditions.
The only one to descend to a judicial parody to assess the accused’s guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular are advocating to bring Omar Khadr home so that he can get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that closes its eyes to torture: it is of little interest to them that a young adult, after so many years of torment, will certainly be emotionally broken forever.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing a treacherous circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our 'democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag before him, and that sounds so insignificant from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one can arbitrarily mistreat, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, entirely at the discretion of a head of government, which is still only supported by the minority (may he belong to the minority after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they can find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order, but they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, lies in this abandonment, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In her September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an Orwellian logic, that the world’s largest gold mining company sought a libel lawsuit of over six million against three authors and a small, low-income publishing house, with the aim of opening a “public transparent debate.”
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of libel lawsuits, but the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
For Barrick Gold, the best way to hold a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the trial ends, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the gold mine’s nearly inexhaustible pockets.
The tactics of these unequal struggles, moreover, are often to ruin the defenders in order to enforce a consensual arrangement that silences the other side and, moreover, deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
Contrary to what is commonplace in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates are usually held in Canada through the exchange of ideas and not by battering.
So it would have sufficed if the gold mine had disclosed its books and files and opened up a real debate through which newspapers, media, publications and the funding of independent audit teams could have shed light on this issue.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a handshake.
Could Mr Garver perhaps explain how he can at the same time ask for a 'public' debate while disregarding the opinions of this public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice President, this word only encompasses the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a very narrow view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public supporting the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because they reject the brutal stance of the gold mine.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, and not within a framework that many perceive as a gag complaint (in the course of the 'public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a call to the authors of Noir Canada, demanding that they stop using this term...).
Apart from Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s lawsuit is a direct attack on the freedom to academic research and truth-finding fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to explore and discuss topics that the rich companies of the world do not like, who else can do that?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could lead it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to get a grip on debates and disagreements and solve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate, and it’s time for governments to take action that limits this kind of unjustified lawsuit.
Wall Street bailout: Democrats and Republicans understand each other
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most comprehensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to stop the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main content is: better control over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of public funds used, new orders to curb the number of houses seized due to arrears, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the executives of the supported companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative Judd Gregg, present at the negotiations, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market-effective,” said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
“Everything was done to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t, the trauma, chaos and unrest in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had accelerated over the last two hours, fearing the impact that a renewed failure would have had on investors’ mood.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of the market this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who were late in the negotiations, were more likely to be proponents of the agreement, but without failing to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that they had to be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama insisted on adding certain orders to the agreement, especially those that would allow owners to keep their homes, and those that would affect the salaries of the executives of the state-saved companies.
Asking taxpayers to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of certain people is not something to be congratulated on.
But these measures are necessary,” he explained on American television.
When asked on another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: “I’d like to know the details first, but I hope so.
“The guidelines I’ve read show that this is one thing we’re all going to have to digest and that we’re going to be able to move forward with.
The option of doing nothing at all is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan is geared towards taxpayers’ money
It comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage loans (subprime), before expanding to other forms of more widespread bonds (PCAA), and eventually resulted in the freezing of financial power and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
A group of Republican MPs failed last week’s first attempt to unify.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain “toxic” assets of society in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, it is believed to escape the impasse.
To round out the perspectives for all in Congress, a decree has also been added that if the government should make losses with this program within five years, it can then levy new taxes in order to recover its capital used.
The new plan envisages the payment of a first sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion can be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In return for his help, Washington receives shares in the supported companies that bring him dividends in the event of profits, and that it can sell again when the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the option of stopping the seizure procedures regarding the apartments tied to the property loans affected by this plan, as well as setting deadlines for repayment and severance payments paid to the executives of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him today, and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
In fact, there were more votes against this plan yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t understand us,” Republican Scott Garett, a member of the Chamber’s Finance Commission, told his voters.
“Yes, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is asking the taxpayers to pay.”
Democratic Deputy Brad Sherman, head of a group in Congress called ‘the sceptic’s chewing gum’, presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred excellent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to tell us: we ask Congress not to be pressured and carefully consider which path to take,” he said.
At the same time, we in Europe once again received proof that this is a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, who is in great difficulty since she lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US dollars) in crisis due to high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
“This is not money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
To compensate, we have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what savers and households value now that uncertain times are announcing.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank distressed by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all current loans at Bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion ($75.5 billion) from real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
After Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to nationalize the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Dedicated Icon
His beauty with his azure eyes was his trump for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly horrible monsters.
But what a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from the consequences of lung cancer on his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of his golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was a kind of rival on the canvas for a long time, more careful in his spectacle, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the blasting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often produces wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream was to emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in him, a whole country that was in love with the self-made man was reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then visited the Actor's Studio in New York before he succeeded in theatre, television and soon also in cinema.
This man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who finished second in the 1979 Mans 24-hour race, and also a sex symbol, although he had been living in a flagship relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and over-sensitive star, whose riddles will never be completely solved, disappear.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put cinema lovers in turmoil this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories all his major roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change goes by with it.
This is where the charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) comes to mind, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Hot Brass Roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
It will evoke a much shorter memory (1990) of his sensitive gentleman Bridge, who is disturbed at his old age by a wedding that did not fulfill all of her promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and memorable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean whose death was resumed in 1956.
This sympathetic ganove in the outstanding The Sting (The Clou), which was awarded the Oskar for the best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through time, he was.
Still he.
In his resume, epochs come together.
The youth know him especially from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the little-orthodox coach of an ice hockey team.
His fans found him again in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers in 1994.
In 2003, Sam Mendes' last role as Pate of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition closed.
Unlike several cinematic legends who withdrew from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, betraying Hollywood, his fortune, his splendor, and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to ‘underplaying’ when he judged his all too expressive performances.
It wasn’t always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time.
However, he was less likely to play Sunnyboys than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, nauseators or despairers, with whose perfect representation he reflected his slipping and revolt.
As a director, Newman unveiled unknown sides of his true sensitiveness.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (after the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a delicate portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness.
In the flood of honors that arose yesterday over Newman, his close friend and former rifle mate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said: “His presence has improved my life and this country.
Generosity and joie de vivre were essential characteristics of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of Hollywood’s drifting away, is now also going there.
We have probably often seen him standing with his foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this was quite tasteless, although at first we found it fun.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman committed himself to the shot.
He left a letter to his five daughters with these sentences: “Until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to trace the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the narrowest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the billing factory of Zuschlag&amp; Co.?
Negotiations begin on 8 October in the criminal trial against Jáno’s contract and his accomplices.
The defendants are accused in particular of involvement in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent injury and business fraud, and other criminal offences, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor's office, the funds lucrative from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services rendered were often documented with fake invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have flowed partly into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private coffers of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were presented when the tender funds were collected, and the associations should not have fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were faked.
The billing blocks were bought at the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies to issue the invoices was made on that round trip north of Lake Balaton, to which István Lados of János was sent a contract.
In the course of this "experience tour", Lados should locate guesthouses and restaurants.
He demanded bills about the consumptions in order to be able to issue bills for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, and the self-government of Budapest based on these templates.
These accounts are said to have been manipulated by István Lados and his accomplice, András Ari, the latter, according to our information, was responsible for the constitution of the corresponding reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "experience tour" was a beer bar.
As two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003 can be seen, the catering company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the Biztos Pont Egyesulet association.
Now, however, the head of the company says that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another bill, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv?ert Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik?vezred?ert, also showed serious errors in form and content.
In a guest house in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently not limited when it came to Pigal Kft., a catering company in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jöv?ért and Hoppá, according to the prosecution, do not even appear.
As Managing Director Gyiza Farkas told hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were fake documents when documents were presented to him by the public prosecutor during a survey.
"Our company name and tax number were incorrectly placed on the stamp."
Aside from form defects, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated one hundred people was also wrong, having a total of eleven rooms that could not possibly accommodate so many people.
It was also mentioned on the bill catering, the restaurant was not in operation for a long time.
The incumbent counterfeiters also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted only offered travel abroad, and so they indicated Hungary travel on the cash bill, which was also contrary to the company’s accounting practice.
As the investigation revealed, they also included VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services related to a country outside the EU are exempt from value added tax.
The total amount of VAT on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jöv?ért Foundation was incorrect, since instead of 25, the company only charges 15 percent VAT, in addition, only machine invoices are issued by the employees, but the fake documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that had been made by the "accounting officers" was that in one case they had declared "carriage of goods" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the firm specialized in investment advice, the prosecution said.
Further form defects - incorrect billing format, wrong stamp - were due to the fact that the invoices issued to Együtt a Harmadik svezredért Alapátvány, as well as to XXI Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeits.
Likewise in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the sports camp Kunfehertó, whose managing directors claimed to never have issued the invoices.
Another "mistake" has been made by the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Ny'regyháza: this company was in dissolution at the time (2001), when the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have eaten there - the mass administrator therefore stated that he did not issue the invoices himself.
Consciously Fake
The other group of accountants are people who were well aware that they would have to make fictitious invoices.
At the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjá Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapátvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Avezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictitious invoices.
Biogate Kft., which is also currently in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with Zuschlag and Co.: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have supplied the Jobb Jöv?ért Alap?tvány Foundation, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfeny? Egyesület with counterfeit invoices with a total value of HUF 5 million, which were related to non-performance.
However, there were also no payment transactions, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, but what the persons concerned have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants includes persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a fuel and vehicle trading company based in Budapest.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components with a total value of HUF of approximately 18 million between October and December 2005.
According to the investigative authority, Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005, is said to have acted as the buyer of these invoices.
The manager of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigation to have issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik a vezredért Alapitvány and to have collected their equivalent itself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers at the express request of Iván Kubatov.
In fact, none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was tasked with preparing the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices totalling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade.
The prosecutor’s office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and VAT each.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for the issuance of fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were settled with the applications of Bizto's Pont.
In January 2006, Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapátvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but used these amounts for misuse.
To cover this up, they submitted five fictitious invoices of Works Team Kft. to the TMA.
By the way, these bills were secured during the search of the office of the Ministry of Education of Arpád Kemecsei.
In the negotiations, some defendants now expect a confession about the procedure of counterfeiting, as they were already filed before the public prosecutor’s office.
It could be a sensation if the main defendant, János, decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already pledged several times to report extensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question remains, therefore, whether this is in his interest, whether the socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reparation of the majority of the damage incurred by HUF 50 million, and whether supplement in return is ready to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the "accused" is now playing after his requests for mitigation of the detention and house arrest had come on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have done far greater damage with economic crimes and have not remunerated them are at liberty, or at least under house arrest, surcharge is denied this possibility.
The Psychology of Overbidding – or Why We Are Ready to Pay More
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more and overestimate what is offered.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in Science magazine, people do not want to be beaten in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers should play lottery, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the subjects' active brain regions were examined using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain cord, was measured in the case of auction losers, in which the overbidding of the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-rewarding" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore thought that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
To support their thesis, the economists in the research group have also conducted research to track the money.
In this case, three groups should compete against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was informed of the true value of the product, after which they made their bets.
Another group was also promised $15 reward, in case they emerge from the game as winners.
The third group received $15 before the auction, which were also lost in case of a lost game.
So the difference between the two groups was that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the "against losing" group were willing to engage higher than those in the control or "win" group.
"These findings cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have so far only justified the behaviors observed at auctions with the joy of winning or avoiding risk.
The contradiction between these two theories has been resolved thanks to imaging neurological procedures, so we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to see the doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people is estimated to be one hundred thousand in this country, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in the case of hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example, through contaminated food or water), in the case of hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretion or saliva).
Travelers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B, and there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear about two to three weeks after consumption of the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by discomfort, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes bright, the urine dark, and the recovery can last up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million people die each year from hepatitis B-induced, far more serious diseases such as liver cancer and cirrhosis.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people is in medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, as the pathogen insidically destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Timely prevention, such as regular inspections, is therefore essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of people suffering from chronic hepatitis C is estimated at 200 million worldwide.
Since the disease is already detectable during a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to see the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby banning the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30th is World Hepatitis Day, held for the first time by patient representatives worldwide in 2004.
The aim of the action is to increase awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, its formation and the importance of early detection.
Do believers have less pain?
As recent research shows, religious belief is thought to be a “pain-killer” that has already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: It was investigated to what extent belief in God affects the feeling of pain in man, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electroshocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate the majority of the pain.
Using brain scan technology, it was even proven that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for controlling pain.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participated.
During the test, a sparkling device was attached to the left hand of the subjects, which gave off the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to concentrate heavily on two paintings: on the one hand a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Dame mit dem Hermelin".
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would evoke some sort of religious trance among the faithful while they chose da Vinci’s image because it was hardly different from the other painting and was found to be reassuring.
The subjects spent half an hour each in an MRI scanner, receiving a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages during this time, while either watching the religious or the other painting.
The Catholics reported that they felt “safe” at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they had been “cared for,” and they felt “rest and peace.”
While contemplating the religious painting, they reported about 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced with other, powerful images, even among the atheists, you just had to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find an image that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
“Practicing faith should change our personality, and it does so in many cases,” Wright said.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what effect a Madonna image of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the occasion of her tenth birthday, Google can rightly say: it is found in people’s pockets just as it is above their heads in the sky: she knows where people spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what moves her.
And still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the managing directors of Google.
In the direction of skeptics, who are plagued by Orwell's horror visions, he lets them align: These would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In an interview with the Financial Times recently, Schmidt said Google’s main goal was to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal of “ordering all the information in the world.”
Schmidt said that after ten years of changing work, Google is still at the beginning of information gathering.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished Google would be able to answer questions such as “What should I do tomorrow?” or “What job really suits me?”, but software programs were not yet able to do so because they didn’t know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that in the course of their Internet research, the search terms will be registered, as well as the IP addresses that were searched from and the pages visited.
For example, the "personalized search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to save his own search history and later to access it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and on the same logic are also based the so-called "recommendations" with which the system recommends customized products and services based on previous preferences.
However, users wonder what happens in the event of a data misuse - "When you look at what I'm doing" - some are concerned about whether the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that has a fear-inspiring effect, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom, or rebellion against the power that many internet users encounter.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties on occasion, and in these legal cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the action against pedophilia in Brazil, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information collected from the community site called "Orkut" and also enabled identification of the pedophilies.
However, users concerned about personal rights were still able to breathe in May, when Google, together with the civil rights organization EFF, successfully tried the FBI: according to this, Google can not be forced to release information to the FBI on secret request in the future with any point of the constitution.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the youth protection law passed years ago, but it has been retroactively withheld from the list of individual users or their web and search terms list for two months.)
So Google’s image remains controversial: those who reluctantly release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google’s services scourge the company with the outrage due to the conservative companies.
However, the American “Geek culture,” which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of “cool entrepreneurs” in them, unlike Microsoft, which is market leader thanks to Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that unlike Microsoft, Google doesn’t require its users to have identification code, and provides its services for free, so an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem far more attractive, youthful, and cooler than the software giant’s official practices.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship of personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has come to the fore in particular in recent years thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing more than collaboration, that is, the users intentionally leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average youth can manage their profile on multiple community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them through other services, such as Twitter, or music services like last.fm, and can eventually incorporate all of this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically display the latest photo galleries that are geostated on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at last night's party photos, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed herself, or the employee is dismissed because he is just too honest about his anger about corporate management in his blog - one thing is certain: the term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Whoever leads an online life is what he reveals about himself - in this way you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who tries to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can be happy to do so - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but intentionally leaves no trace.
Not a few people deliberately don’t register on community sites so they can’t be found, but Google’s online applications, such as word processing and graphical tools and RSS feeds, can also be handled with alternative versions that aren’t tied to huge server parks and therefore don’t generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, however, is eagerly waiting for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising spaces of AdWords/AdSense are threatening the revenues of advertising agencies, and the increasingly rapid deployment of services is causing not only Microsoft but other software developers to break through.
Critical viewers, however, also find the disturbing counterpoles: for example, the corporate management has completely rejected a protest of employees, after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, in addition, the management thought the multiple meals of employees was too expensive. All this, however, seems to be mildly against the fact that Google was in violation in 2006 before the Chinese government, even to the knees, according to the agreement.
The Group's internal regulation is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could change a lot: While some think that Google's book and magazine scan or archiving project is now taking on dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, others are rather concerned about the creation of a "health" system.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database already provides the next generation of sci-fi authors with the stuff – like “Scroogled,” the famous novel by Cory Doctorow in the best Orwellian way describes a future in which a person becomes terrifyingly approachable thanks to data obtained from Google.
Two young people help the double-killer of Izd in the elimination of traces
In connection with the double murder of Izd, the police have now interrogated two young people who are suspected of helping to eliminate the traces, the spokesman for the police commission Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were consistent and are currently being charged with aid.
According to the MTI news agency, two girls are defending themselves freely.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect of the double murder of Izd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken to custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so last Wednesday he lured his creditor to an area in Izd where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has long planned the crime – this also proves the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the crime weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Announces Purchase Offer for Prague Stock Exchange
Around 200 million euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, the Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered for the 100% purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludvik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poles had made despite the fact that they were formerly excluded from the Czechs as potential owners of their stock exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is entirely owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to reports from the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of the Poles contains the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to shareholder agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investment Bank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
In their comments devoted to the increasingly acute international financial crisis on Tuesday, some leading European newspapers already spoke of "Second September".
The global financial catastrophe we owe to the American president, for example, "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to get his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief to the frightening situation...
Instead of a “new Pearl Harbor,” as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate to speak of a “second September 11th.”
Parts of the press in Madrid also locate the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the brink of collapse.
The American financial system is threatening to collapse, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but now, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not have any political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air, at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, for example, the Geneva "Days-Anzeiger".
While some states could still provide bailout packages to their waning financial institutions, saving banks from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and even more banks go bankrupt, then no further financial injections or other immediate measures will help.
In the long run, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralize control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion were paid out to weakening financial institutions, recalls the Viennese "Der Standard". Moreover, the concerns are increasingly realistic that, according to the Americans, European taxpayers must now also go a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
While the “rescues” would not have to “wed” with several hundred billion euros immediately, it would be advisable to record in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayer’s money in order to avert even greater damage.
Smart car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new technologies to avoid accidents if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented, in which Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in the creation of new accident avoiding systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C car-driven biomimetic system, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of the bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval “private area,” which is very similar to our own “protective shield,” said Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers adopted the idea of the laser-controlled distance meter.
This identifies obstacles from the BR23C in a field of vision of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is recorded in fractions of a second, and the autorobot immediately changes the course, similar to the movement of the bees by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
“If it weren’t, the autorobot wouldn’t be able to respond fast enough to avoid the obstacles,” said Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the autorobot project.
The system must act instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently considered unavoidable.
The entire process must reflect the behavior of the bees when they dodge other bees.
And that has to happen in a fraction of a second.
However, in contrast to the bees, dodging can not take place upwards, downwards, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and specifically only in the direction of the maneuverability of the tires.
While there are endless possibilities for the bees to avoid other bees, the researchers could only use the autorobot to rotate, or to accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C contains lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy-efficient, and therefore have a longer service life than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only needs to process a few inputs per second and respond accordingly.
It does not need to store them, or produce an intuitive, logical response based on previous maneuvers, so that it only requires a handful of KB memory.
There is no need for gigabyte and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately guiding the driver around obstacles and thus leading him to the destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now there is the written version of the $700 billion bailout package law, which will be applicable in several stages, aimed at buying out the banks’ bad loans.
In the first round, half of the money will be spent.
In a meeting that ended on Saturday after midnight local time east coast, congressmen ran through after multi-day debates on an agreement on the $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
“We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying that the agreement had to be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout package supported both presidential candidates – Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said: “The program will have an impact and it will be efficient, but more needs to be done, not to save Wall Street, but to take the helm of the economy.”
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8am (Central European time Monday 2am), but did not trigger a high flight on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will first vote on the 2008 bill to stabilize the economy, and then it will be the Senate’s turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress made at night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
However, the program deviates from the Bush administration’s original recommendation that the $700 billion should be spent on buying lazy, credited securities at once.
In a first tranche, a maximum of half of the $700 billion amount is to be spent, with $250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the cause on Monday. This amount is to be spent on buying credit-laden, bad securities, and the president is to decide on the further $100 billion.
The program is reviewed by its own commission, which also includes the Federal Reserve President.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can also use a combined tactic: it can at the same time buy bad loans, mortgages, and mortgage-laden securities, or also other "toxic" loans.
As the competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction, as well as directly.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the Treasury guarantees the worrying funds and the companies pay the costs corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulsen said: “The law defines the funds needed in such a way that up to $700 billion can be made available as emergency aid to the U.S. financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, Paulson said.
However, the heads of the banks in trouble and now dependent on state aid can expect that their clearances, which in the overseas snake are dubbed "Golden Handshake", will be cut by the government.
Salaries will only be cut in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury works.
The cut essentially means that if the ministry buys in an auction, the "golden handshake" is taxed, unless the retired banking boss is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will engage aggressively to ensure that manager salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements, so that the more people participate in the program.
This is the first case in American history that cuts to managerial salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the Finance Committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus also the saved bank are better off.
The bill stipulates that in the next five years, the president must submit to Congress a proposal on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That’s not what American citizens expect from us, the plan does not protect taxpayers’ money, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His Ohio colleague, Mary Kaptur, said: “The measures were driven by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

No more visas to the United States from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances that the U.S.-Hungarian visa agreement will enter into force around January 12, the foreign minister told representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
"Now everything depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in time."
She also stressed that there will be no entry permits in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy is now conducting negotiations in Washington.
She meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present her with the Hungarian Republic’s “Middle Cross of Merit with Star,” and she also holds talks with the foreign policy advisors of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bank bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, on Sunday pledged their support for the $700 billion bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians calling for the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Congress and government representatives announced after days of marathon consultations on Sunday morning that they had reached an agreement on the banking bailout package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be better than their opponents to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama was able to further expand his lead thanks to the economic issues, while McCain’s high, which earned him the presentation of Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, melted away at the same time.
At an election event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly adopt the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
“We must act now, and do so responsibly... your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are being threatened,” he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain’s economic visions “obsolete.”
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said: “We’re all going to have a hard time pining... but doing nothing is definitely not an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also prescribes the establishment of a control commission for the finance minister, as well as the restriction of clearances for top managers - something he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House spokeswoman Nancy Pelosi announced that the House of Representatives would probably already vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking region
The right-wing camp is intact, only voters within the camp became more confident - so "Der Spiegel" comments on the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (mirror.com)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine Franz Walter analyses the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bayern's revolution destroys its fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens are turning away from them.
The breaking of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as is the case for Angela Merkel.
Surprisingly, the disaster of the CSU did not come to an end, but on Sunday something came to an end, which was already quite exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the fifty-percent mark for the first time since the fifties.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. still in the much-cited Stoiber era.
The modernization consistently carried out by the CSU in the federal state has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had predicted this 40 years ago, but at the same time significantly estimated themselves at the pace. But without consequences, the secularization, the success of education, the influx of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain on the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernisation is always accompanied by an increase in options, and this has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact – only the voters within the camp became more critical and self-willed.
It is striking that in the last few weeks, the classical groups of citizens have expressed the greatest distance from the CSU: the free professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school degree.
Here, the CSU’s support dropped to less than 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily newspaper reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders cautiously in coalition questions" titled an article about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the interference of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not yet want to commit to a coalition.
The new elections are over, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders hardly looked into their cards.
SPÖ CEO Werner Faymann reiterated his desire to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between both parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current head of the ÖVP as Vice-Chancellor, left Faymann unanswered.
As he said, the voters had voted off the bowl mortar course.
A repetition of this direction would not be in question.
Molterer, on the other hand, has reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, when Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition, or into the coalition, is currently completely open, and these issues should be discussed internally.
BZÖ CEO Jörg Haider showed himself open in all directions.
“To prevent red-black, we are ready to take over government responsibility,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun in Paris, hosted this year by the EU Council Presidency country France.
In her speech to the plenary session, Mr. Járóka, Member of the Fidesz Group of the European People's Party, drew attention to the segregation of education, which is one of the most serious violations of the rights of Roma children and is the biggest obstacle to their need to apply.
The High-Level Conference was opened by French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizens' organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the Fidesz MEP reports, Járóka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in the job search, Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youths do not have secondary education, and only a small proportion of them can achieve a university degree thanks to poor primary education."
Járóka also stressed that education is a fundamental human right, which would play a key role in the assertion of other human rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children could strengthen the economy of the EU member states.
In the opinion of the MEPs, it is important that the circle of Roma and non-Roma be as broad as possible.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the greater his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; and through income and turnover tax they contribute to national spending.
"As citizens of the European Union, the right to high-quality education must be secured for the Roma - the poor and segregated education must be discontinued," said Lávia Járóka.
As the honourable Member explained, a common, targeted and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary to accelerate the process of de-segregation in the education sector, which requires proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“We must break the vicious cycle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a fully-fledged citizen,” Járóka said.
Since last year’s Congress in Berlin, the summit has been organized annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advancement of the objectives of equal opportunities and freedom of discrimination at European, but also national, in the sense of the “European Year of Equal Opportunities”.
CSU: Grace for Time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling yet, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein remain in their offices, the question is how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of vote will be decided on the last weekend of October at the Extraordinary Party Congress.
However, the much reviled duo already showed that they do not want to stick to their armchairs.
With this, they want to soothe the angry faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, admittedly under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian Social Union reached 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the vote.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only governor" in Bavaria, which generates 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
The conservatives remain the determining force in the southern federal state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, but will have to rule in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the internal restructuring, Huber’s potential successor, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, is also involved in the exploration team, which is conducting exploratory talks with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing “free electorate” about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is that with the list "Free voters" Gabriele Pauli comes into the legislature, whose anti-dustling appearance first exploited the Huber-Beckstein duo, then mercilessly serve the determined politician.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its efforts on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings out of the background, will play an active role. The former Prime Minister and CSU chairman called September 28 the "bitterest day of his political career".
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks towards the CDU – in his opinion, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
If the CSU, which also contributed a lot to success at the national level in 2005, is not reestablished with a joint act of force, Merkel cannot become Chancellor again after the Bundestag elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who hasn’t made a secret of her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the CSU’s land loss won’t have a negative impact on the big coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats will continue.
At 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In the elections on Sunday, no member of the opposition made it into the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegality in counting the votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, has not recognized the elections.
Although the 10-million-inhabitant state has been without opposition for decades, the opposition party, called the United Democratic Forces (ODS), has sincerely hoped that Lukashenko, who in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would "renew" his presidency mandate in the parliament for the fourth time.
Therefore, the ODS has even distanced itself from the previously planned boycotts.
Ukraine is becoming increasingly economically dependent on Russia's imports of natural gas. In order to alleviate price increases, loans have even been taken, and the country has also approved the sale of Beltransgas, the owner of the country's leading gas pipeline, to the Russians. So, in the background of opposition expectations, the hope was that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU, after Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians have classified as anti-
A temporary relaxation was provided by the OECD election evaluation report, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of one-third of opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD’s quick report already on Monday criticized the campaign – so oppositionists are not likely to be in the press – and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in counting the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to see an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is even ready for minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the renegade Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two areas as independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backward, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich told the paper.
In the opinion of the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition candidate into parliament".
The opposition is not planning protest measures in the light of the results, but rather trying to clarify the need for economic reform to the voters.
"We have a lot of problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put stones in the way of distribution, but still I see that more and more people support the change, even the older ones," Milinkevich said, citing that not even the most supported layer of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the creation of social security.
"Thanks to the country's debt and the rise of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'social security', which reminds us of the silence of a cemetery, begins to crumble," Milinkevich said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, told the news agency Ria Novosti: “People believe the actions, not the words, and the absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast will be served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From today onwards, the measure will come into force against those sly mice who first stamp out and then go out drinking coffee during working hours.
The new “Anti-Faulpelz Act” was presented today by Renato Brunetta, Minister of Public Administration, and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Council of Ministers’ Bureau.
"Rotable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," Brunetta said.
“A new era of responsibility and transparency is beginning.
This is reformism,” Brunetta stresses once again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends in all buildings of the Presidium of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: “The choice of rotating doors is also of great symbolic value.”
There was no resistance on the part of the officials, the secretary-general assured: “This process was supported by all, cooperation came from all sides.”
All in all, there is no more breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant.
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Higher Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
The minister of Rome announced that “within three months, the absences of officials have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people are present at work each year.”
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of the public administration of Italy
“Their wage dynamics have been twice as high as the private sector in the last 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have teamed up to counter the Brunetta decree in the context of the appeal supported by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service is profiled with figures on lower absences at work - writes the Consumer Center - the people of 'active lazyness' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable public service officials have come together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree.
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is fighting for additional financial compensation for work-related illness, including the planned extension of the mandatory house arrest of the sick worker, during which inspection visits can be made and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are challenged.
Napolitano: ‘Prevention of accidents at work is crucial’
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 remain incapacitated for life.
For 2007, data from the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These numbers prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as those caused by murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) in all provinces of Italy will celebrate the 58th National Day for the victims of work accidents in order to draw the attention of social institutions and the media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm the crucial importance of prevention in the workplace," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his communication to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in the workplace, to protecting the injured workers, to helping the families of the victims and to raising awareness of public opinion".
"An outrageous 'bastard' has risen to this; understandable in the case of tragedies that, in terms of their magnitude, trigger some swirling in the media and public participation, but everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even be repeated in their own dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is in any case also a resource problem: it must be invested decisively in education and information."
The numerous initiatives for more direct awareness in school settings are of particular importance to young people who are feeding on the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness, and we must put in place and improve a legislative standard.
For his part, the President of the Chamber, Gianfranco Fini, stressed "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths creates an urgent social emergency that offends the consciences of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards firm rules that aim to end the problem".
“The data from the work accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of work-related deaths is far too high,” said Anmil President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'positive tendency' to mean less attention. That's exactly what causes the tragedy in the end."
"It's like thinking that you're basically doing too little to deal with the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight it through different actions.
In our opinion, stronger controls and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting in school.”
"Another effort is necessary - he adds - in terms of communication and sensitization of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency is required."
Mercandelli also commented on "the progressive deterioration of protection for victims of accidents at work" and denounced the "abolition of the social system against which we have been fighting in recent years".
The aim is, therefore, to return to the worker a guarantee of insurance, so that the fate of the victim of a work accident does not become dependent on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided from time to time by a legislator.
Mp3 Player under Indictment: Risk of Hearing Damage
Listening to loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as MP3 players, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
In a report published today in Brussels, the European Commission quotes the opinion of the Csrseri (Scientific Committee on Current and Recently Identified Health Risks) of the EU.
"The report shows that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for more than one hour a day risk permanent loss of hearing."
“I’m worried that such a large number of teens, who usually put portable music devices and mobile phones at a high volume, irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it,” said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific findings - it is said on the part of the European Union - show a clear risk, which pushes for rapid action.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and make this information a common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we need to review the already existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in light of the widespread use of portable music devices among young people.
"Scientists - concludes the EU Communication - confirm that one is rightly concerned and that the European Commission, together with the other EU members and those concerned, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise coming from portable music devices and similar devices".
There is already a European standard that limits the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB, and concerns about the damage that could be caused by excessive noise.
These damages can be very limited by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of noise exposure.
In its report, the EU’s Scientific Committee points out that if the users of portable music devices only listen to loud music for five hours a week (more than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at work are already exceeded.
Those who cross this line of music risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This is 5-10% of the users of such devices, whose number can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We'll start today, we'll be over in March, we'll take stock in June.
This is the procedure set by the Capitol for the work of the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome, which met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will work out the guidelines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the City Council and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects in order to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - stresses Alemanno. "It will propose a development plan for Rome, whose political responsibility will remain with the city council and the municipal council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where one can develop a large project for Rome.
In March, their task will be completed and the Commission will dissolve again, as such a project must have a time-determined endpoint.
In June, the mayor announced, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Anyone who questions the competence of the Commission, because their opinion is not binding, answers Alemanno: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, like the Attali Commission in France, it delivers quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to have a longer period of time in view, in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following: "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think. It will employ the best minds of the capital".
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to take a quality leap - which it really needs - and thus to take a joint step into the future."
A future, according to the mayor of Rome, which “will not only limit itself to the current municipal borders, but will look much further”, not only in terms of Rome’s role as a metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as a future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.”
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here’s a statement
A well-known American politician, who cares a lot about being considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and who maintained relations with hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private man).
The attacks on Obama are getting more and more violent, just as the elections are approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet site: “This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very naughty: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!”
Actually, however, these attacks don’t have much to say; they are racist attacks and they don’t answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; everyone says that Obama will win with a big lead.
Also in this case, there are people who talk with the heart and not with the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, wrote in its editorial: Only in the ballot box will we know who the real American patriot will give his voice to.
Here comes a mentality of the United States that was kept hidden until the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll decide who we’re going to do our squeezing for, whether for Obama or for McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you’ve never heard before – only now that the black candidate’s success seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% responded: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Nevertheless, Iraq remains for the majority the weak point of Bush.
The one who will take his place is facing a huge task.
The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: you can already feel the cuts in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of the press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and their mental control of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern about the general credibility of the information relating to those responsible.
You don’t feel as alone as you used to.
The problem for American journalists is money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the major problems caused by the cuts in the newsroom, i.e. the room in which the editors work to compile the newspaper.
This is a problem that needs to be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the general public understands it, from shrinking significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism now meets the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the press believe that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
In the local area, the executives are even at the 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine the direction in which the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are paving their way into the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted to wanting to join the new technology in hopes of “bringing something good for journalism.”
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the chief editors of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of editors at national level are confident that their reporters share their values with them, while at local level it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with “safety at work.”
Operations managers who are afraid to lose their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "editors", ed.) is always a topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV channels and Internet operators, employers offer as they like and so it becomes a matter of take it or leave it.
The editors in chief often get very high wages, but the editor can sometimes only get 10,000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance funds.
As for the holiday, the thing becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 days of vacation after a certain number of years.
But American journalists often become “sick” over the course of the year, as they themselves admit.
It is a question of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROM: DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal chamber of the court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the request of the real estate agent, who had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It will be investigated against Coppola for bankruptcy in the context of the counter-agreement investigation in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
Over the course of the trial against him during the last week, his release from house arrest was transformed into a duty of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella had asked to allow the real estate agent to be transferred from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the public prosecutor’s office had appealed) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and obtain evidence accusing him.
The elite is in danger.
The phenomenon had been revealed a few days ago when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the $700 billion savings package from the White House: A large part of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday’s edition of the New York Times, which reports how the crisis is splitting up the Republican party, which is increasingly splitting into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which has always favored state institutions and the business community, and those neoconservatives who are “hostile to those in Washington” and the financial world, and are gaining voters, especially in the south and central states.
This part of the party owes its rise above all to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example, however, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake is announcing or even already representing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West and perhaps beyond, will it be affected.
Both in the states and in Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the long-awaited events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the rediscovery, the unheard of renaissance of the state in connection with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a decline in banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage an enormous amount of assets of private households that live in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: namely, how to behave towards the families affected, which are also an enormous mass of voters.
So the crisis appears to be global economically, but politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism in itself seems to have fallen aside and lost its right to speak: the obvious proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, does not find a common way.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and especially distribution of aid funds: Since the crisis became more and more serious, only the US is in the economic position to save itself without foreign help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use them: thus, two conditions that cannot be overstated – under certain circumstances – to which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to resort in a similar way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed on the state-national element is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that has recently been associated in the economy with one of the most closely related sectors: territoriality.
Paradoxically, it is precisely now that we have been so convinced that we have long since entered a networked whole empire, a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, the intangible, that we must at once determine how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
These can all be transported from one place to the other in the world, but they are still connected to a narrowly defined piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, he who has such a territory is in favor of another who lives in a harvestless, waterless or oil-free area.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a brief insertion.
Who says territory, who says government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to generate two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leadership, i.e. the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of the economy, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and more disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an intolerance, an image of ineffectiveness, a sense of distance, all aimed at a whole class of managers in Western countries.
It seems to pave the way for the conviction among large sections of the population that it is not only the actions of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose salary presents itself to the majority as ever more alien and outdated.
The demand for leadership, therefore, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of disempowering the leading class and the traditional political establishment, manifested in the unforeseen "revolts" of the voters and in the sudden upheaval of the collective state of mind in recent times: starting with the rise of the conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, perhaps playing a role here in the collapse of the Labour Party.
One gets the impression that the old elite, its parties, its programs, but also its rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say its format, has more and more problems of understanding and therefore less representative value in relation to what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today, and is being amplified and driven from the financial crisis to overdimensionality.
In view of all of this, it would be simply exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
Keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that rises on walls
Defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which seems to have almost reached its destination.
With an adhesive applied to an area of only 2.5 sq cm, the researchers succeeded in fixing a 100 kg body on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the already used adhesives, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of spaghetti tubes arranged in a stack," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have been inspired by the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests carried out with various materials such as glass teflon and abrasive paper have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the holding capacity of the feet of the reptiles and at the same time "removes it from the wall without any problems," according to Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be used as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Further areas of application could fall within the field of space travel.
For now, the superheroes have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is devoted to a new type of glue.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, the California scientists present a microfibre adhesive that cleans itself from the dust by moving on a surface like hair and thus always maintains perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed mainly in summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious health damage if taken at the same time as certain vital medications, as they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points out the risk of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with drug intake. At the 236th meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he once again sounded the alarm: A glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice is enough to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital medications to the extent that these are practically eliminated from the patient’s health.
Grapefruit juice was already suspected to be responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, antiasthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients in a report two years ago of the dangers of this mix, stressing to pay attention to what is drunk in conjunction with drugs such as diazepane or metadone.
IT IS NOT ONLY GRAPE FRUIT – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the drugs.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Michele Carruba, Director of the University of Milan, said: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers who are free to change consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are any uncertainties, not to be afraid to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize for Economics goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize is awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the establishment of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of September 11, 2001, during the days of the Enron collapse, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event had been more crucial to U.S. history than the assassinations.
A prediction that received a lot of polemics in response and was presented to the economist years later, but is now completely correct.
"I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the memory of the scandals disappeared from the public eye in the context of the Enron or Worldcom collapses," Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is an “econom of great value”, but also a banaliser with a “very aggressive style, which is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining an ever-increasing number of users as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in the public administration.
After a year of intensive work by the voluntary developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office now presents itself with some novelties to the audience: in addition to a revised and now more spartanly designed initial menu, finally a fundamentally guaranteed compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is achieved, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version, given.
There was also attention to compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which makes it easier to send via email, including the possibility to import PDF files into graphics editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
In this way, it is now possible to generate "hybrid" PDF files, which extend the typical graphics of the Adobe format by the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most enhanced elements of the applications: tables can now be edited by multiple users, avoiding conflicts during changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a phrase to ensure a better correction process.
Some companies are in the process of publishing various features of OpenOffice on the internet (on the cloud), while in the coming weeks the final result is to be made public.
The Italian version is available for download at the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
Except for Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be sent home or to the office.
However, if freedom of charge can be an incentive for the distribution of the program in private households, it is also in the business sector where OpenOffice could succeed: after all, various public administration and schools have already switched to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized enterprises, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice is composed of five main components: Writer, the Word-appropriate text creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to displace Excel; Impress, for creating presentations such as with PowerPoint; Dbase for operating databases instead of the more familiar Access; and finally Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can easily be exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already reached.
Kohl also tested positive and thus the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens up in the context of the previous Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, who is the third-class winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl from Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to be tested positive for Cera, the third-generation epo, which was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Ricci and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from the blood samples of Kohl are among those made in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
Confirming the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French anti-doping commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and, according to the Associated Press, also notify the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEM IMPORTANCE: THE NEW YORK TIME ASKS: IS ITALY RASSISTIC?
Italy, "the former country of emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants", which are only welcomed with reluctance.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article dedicated entirely to the topic of racism in Italy, about the case of the boy Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after he stole a pack of cookies.
The case bears witness to what the Times calls the “Paradox of the North”: the northern regions are those where “the most integration and employment opportunities exist, and yet “the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiment and the greatest support of the Lega North can be seen.”
In confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation introduced by the Lega against immigration and the expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
Giorgio Napolitano said: “At a meeting at the Quirinal, Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope for cooperation between the Church and the state to fight racism.”
Students victims of up to 900 euros per room
The student housing market has no crises.
According to the latest investigation by Sunia, the tenant union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious traits. Whole droves of students are losing their right to study so effectively because their families are not able to support them at this level" - according to Sunia Mariani - "in these cities, the great demand on the part of the students leads to a deformation of the market, which has also harmed the other residents.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, no rental price limit, illicit subleases.
For Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices due to a revision of the taxation.
A closer look at the investigation reveals that in Milan a sleeping space in the Brianza district is needed about 450 euros; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the Bande Nere district) and ends with 800 euros in the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera district or even 900 euros in the Vittoria district.
On average a bed in Florence costs 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the neighborhoods around the university, there are 250/280 euros for a bed of necessities, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, prices in the districts around the university are around 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping space in a double room.
Only a little lower are the rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome: 550 euros in Ostiense and Cinecitt.
Only those who dodge in outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping space and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a sleeping place, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive neighborhoods, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari a bed costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
Prices are lower in the smallest cities, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: renting, which is 25-30% above average, is demanded by foreign students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso – the cities close their historic cinemas
The historic cinemas close due to the favored multiplex cinemas.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, like a face without eyes.”
This image by director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is happening at the moment in the major urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of excluding cinemas, which began with the birth of the large multi-room complexes in the periphery, means death in the long run for the one-room cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also bears the characteristics of a cultural crime.
It is like losing a friend with whom you have traveled a piece of road full of emotions,” says the director of the film “Nuovo Cinema Paradiso”, which brought him the Oskar and the Cannes Grand Prix 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a probably lost cinema world.
The figures provided by Anec, the central trade association, speak a clear language: over the past five years, the vast number of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; this tick paid for the most part the cinemas in the major cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This proves that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy leads the lists, 81 in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, President of Anec, "though it is useful that new structures also emerge, the preservation of the already existing one comes first, because if a hall in the city closes, not all its regular customers are willing to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here the lack of budget for the fund of the trade association remains out of the box: the debt burden recorded by the state is about 10 million euros.
It is a disgrace from the ethical point of view that the government does not comply with existing laws.
In order to maintain the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed."
It is interesting to note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, due to the fears surrounding the old cinemas, decided to protect them by means of an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first such agreement in Italy that aims to protect and support traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the measures foreseen are also tax advantages for cinema operators and benefits for the public regarding local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the restricted areas of the center and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
“It’s a gratifying initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “I hope that other cities will follow our example and also design new concepts.
Certainly, however, we also need better audio and video equipment in order to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important issue for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even though I had been playing with the thought for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years; when I pass by the Rialto or the Quirinale in the Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn aside to avoid having to see the dusty posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was prepared to adapt the decisions of the municipality to the interests of the Piromalli Mafia Group.
The allegations of Calabria’s lawyers against Mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, who were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia shops, are serious.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his nephew, was also handcuffed: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the clan’s boss, had already been sentenced to a compensation amount of 10 million euros for involvement in criminal associations of the mafia at the time.
“Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm,” the lawyers write, “the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli money for consulting activities.”
“This allowed the mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls officially and to co-determine the policy of public administration.”
The president of the Calabria Regional Committee, Agazio Loiero, does not deny that in his region "it is anything but an exception to encounter connections between local administrations and organised crime." "There are places where the concentration of the mafia is greater than in others where such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who maintain a white vest."
The arrests of this morning follow those of last July, with which, according to police, the clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and even then due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after the 2006 election.
He shouted scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He appealed to Vice Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons, but the judges stated in connection with this morning’s arrest warrant that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From an interception related to the Dal Torrione case, there has been a willingness to respond to the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli – thus making the public administration’s actions identical to the interests of this clan.”
When the energy comes from the waves, the big ones suddenly run up.
It is an unblemished source of money covering over 70% of the planet’s surface, and it is only now that the world’s major energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and is also looking to occupy, such as giants like Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been considered and studied for 70 years; these studies have not by chance intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now environmental organizations and the rising price of oil are pushing for new impetus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world’s energy needs could be met by the energy generated by ocean waves.
This would equal twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are the currents and tides.
Giants in the attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract for the construction of a power plant in northern Portugal in 2005.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more companies from the traditional energy industry are now relying on marine energy production.
“Chevron is investigating these technologies,” said the spokesman for a company known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of working with us.”
This is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a not to be underestimated sign, especially when you consider that the U.S. continues to extract oil in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey are also investing in the new industry; if the details are not known, observers speak of increasing interest.
Still better technologies.
Experts speak of a technology still underway, not least because the last doubts on the part of environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a much greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are several options: Ocean Power uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is then sent to the coast via underwater pipelines.
So far, there are four planned installations of this type, which are only waiting for government approval. Part of the energy gained could also be used for military facilities.
Verdant Power, however, already produces energy for a department store and a parking lot using submarine turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drives the turbines, which feed the generator as a result of the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long line of potential clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, a particular interest deserves the potential that is present in the tides right now.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are better predictable than wind currents, sunlight and also waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
It is tidal energy in particular that led states like New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, to invest $7.5 million in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
