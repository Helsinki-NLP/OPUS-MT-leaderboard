Members of the National Assembly of Wales concerned that they ‘will be compared to Muppets’
There is turmoil among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales through a proposal that their title would be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a result of plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ to ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are concerned that the new name appears ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly of Wales said MWP “rides on Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside of Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the Plaid Party’s National Assembly of Wales said the group as a whole was “disapproved” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party is ‘open’ to the name change, but notes that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The Commission of the National Assembly of Wales, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: “It is of course the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave members of the National Assembly of Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
Regarding the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
Currently, members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have a hard time reaching a consensus. She will have to submit a bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the system of committees.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when debating the legislation.
People of Macedonia vote in a referendum on changing their country’s name
On Sunday, voters will vote to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia.”
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a persistent dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to applications from Macedonia to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said that he will not take into account the outcome of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint Martin's silence, those of Harlem have a hard time
“The older people I talked to said that there was a cafe and a church here at every corner in the past,” Mr. Adams said.
Today there is neither a cafe nor a church to be found here.”
He said it's understandable that cafes have disappeared.
“People are now socially connected in a different way,” he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the neighborhood, where people regularly visit.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of the Church’s assets will last less long than the leaders expect, “and sooner or later they will stand back at the beginning.”
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats where the kind of people would live that won’t help in the remaining refuges of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,” he says, “which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to these flats will become members of the church community.”
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolitan community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church of white methodists left in the 1930s.
A nearby black church took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black parish led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers in 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939, the building was severely damaged by fire, but when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the church, they also bought a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin’s, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July referred to the instrument in a different way: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The University of Michigan expert, Tiffany Ng, also noted that this was the first carillon in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon of the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's hadn't replaced him.
The events of the last months at Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July to express its concern that the diocese “would like to pass on the costs” to the diocese, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors who had sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dived to lobsters in California
On Saturday, on the first day of the lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy who dived into lobsters in California. The boy suffered injuries, it says.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he paddled to the boy to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was crying because he had caught a lobster, but then he realized “that the boy was crying, ‘I’m bitten!
I'm bitten!"
His keybone was completely open,” Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
“I shouted that everyone should get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in danger of life.
It is not known which species of shark is responsible for the attack.
Beach guard captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted nearby, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
Authorities closed access to Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for research and safety.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's wants to break through the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and establishes beauty departments where specialist assistants work, such as in grocery stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the UK beauty market, which is worth 2.8 billion pounds and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household items continue to decline. The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country. If they turn out to be a success, they will be introduced in even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the shelves where TVs, microwaves and interior items once stood with other products.
Sainsbury’s wants to double its beauty offering and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees is also getting more space, with showrooms by brand, such as in stores such as Boots.
The grocery store is also releasing its Boutique makeup, as most products are vegan-friendly, something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the fragrance shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores. The first was opened earlier in Croydon, in southern London, and the second will open later this year in Selly Oak, in Birmingham.
As more and more people shop online and increasingly buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Sainsbury’s chief executive, says the stores will look more like grocery stores as the supermarket chain takes on discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury’s has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since both chains were acquired two years ago. According to the company, this has increased food sales and has led to more returns on acquisitions.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its Beauty and Pharmacy departments a makeover, that became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose about distributing revenue from the pharmacy department into supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury’s 281 pharmacy departments in stores sold three years ago to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have completely changed the design of our beauty department to make it more pleasurable for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we ensure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop in the old way.
Peter Jones 'Angered' After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From  Pound 11 Million Deal
Peter Jones, one of Dragons Den’s stars, is “furious” as TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a 11 million-pound deal with his lifestyle business. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
Jones and Willoughby's company is sometimes compared to the brand Goop by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning announced on Instagram that she is leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby for having pulled out of their profitable lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “furious” when Willoughby announced Tuesday during a difficult meeting at the company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire that her new contracts (worth as much as a million and a half pounds) did not give her enough time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand, and is expected to double Willoughby’s fortune of an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave Truly, Jones left for one of his vacation rentals abroad.
A source said, “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would secure her long-term future, and yield enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to retire.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for shortly.
The warehouse of the headquarters in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now be further delayed.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two couples often go on vacation together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones’s entourage said last night: “We don’t have any commentary on his business affairs.”
“Hard language, and then it was love between us.”
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a comment he made that some people would find “unfit for a president,” and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the dismantling of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
Negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” by the United States following North Korea’s first disarmament initiatives.
Meanwhile, the United States is continuing its sanctions to keep pressure on the kettle, he said.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
“We are doing very well in North Korea,” he said.
“We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to positive results, the missile tests have ended, hostages have been liberated, and the material surpluses of American soldiers have returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach regarding his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this busy arena, about 200 people would stand here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok no longer had a home, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for initiating international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they are not seeking international help, which is difficult for us,” Mrs. Sumbung said.
Save the Children is compiling a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain whether the relief workers from abroad can work on site.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the Agency for National Disaster Assistance, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would get permission to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh shelters were built to hide from tsunamis, but along other coasts you rarely see them.
That there was no warning siren for tsunamis in Palu, even though a warning was in effect, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal conditions, it can be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship landed in Lombok to treat victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia’s haveless infrastructure was one of the key points of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko’s government is struggling with a shortage of funding, while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are now following a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic gangs were fighting on the streets, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool makes an impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was at a distance of about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team was 1-0 behind.
He tipped left against the ball and then kicked in the direction of the farthest pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, in the direction of the upper right corner of the net.
He evaded the jump of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
‘I saw Kante approaching and dared to try. I didn’t really think about it, I just kicked on the ball.’
Chelsea was 1-0 ahead of the rest, after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, after which he rushed through the midfield to the Liverpool half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two on the midfield.
Then he gave a nice pass, which allowed Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alisson Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League against Napoli on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will compete in London on Thursday at 3 p.m. against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the debris of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the 7.5-strong earthquake last Friday, which also resulted in waves of 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after wife stabbed to death
This morning, the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m. The body was stabbed and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking local residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation has just begun, but I want to ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact if they have possibly filmed something via a dashcam, because they can have information that is essential for our research.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the place to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have confirmed that they are currently informing the victim’s family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one is allowed into or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared crying on the spot.
She keeps repeating, “How bad!”
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the deposition and a third was just outside.
Within the deposition, a number of officers watched the apartment building.
If you have any information, you will be asked to send a message to MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, stating log 247 of September 30.
Statue of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history' riot
The exile of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s suggestion as “foolish” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the sighting of Oliver Cromwell’s figure just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful statue of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to the opinion that prevailed in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many still believe should be recognized today.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that gap.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be acknowledged and remembered.”
Pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China, according to reports in the local media.
The man, whose surname is only known, was found dead at a market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. His artery was pierced and he was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares for the vaccination of pigs at a pig stable, on 30 May 2005, in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and a door to a neighboring pigsty appeared to be open.
According to the cousin, there was a big male pig with blood on his mouth in the pig house.
A forensic investigation revealed that the pig weighing 250 kg had killed the farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and mutilated,” the cousin with the surname “who” said, according to the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
Footage from surveillance cameras shows that Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not from Yuan or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others while police gathered evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and market authorities are reportedly currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It rarely happens, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer at CBC News testified that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
“They are just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... They're not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa's tail brings heavy rain to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted, hurricane Rosa is weakening now that she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
Rosa, however, will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
With a wind speed of 135 km/h, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time, located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form above the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed northward, to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Subsequently, tropical moisture that responds to the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Tropical moisture will result in precipitation of 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rain is expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in parts of the southwest, especially above most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, as the tropical rain can fall very scattered.
It is strongly advised not to walk into the desert when tropical rains threaten.
The heavy rainfall can transform ravines into ferocious rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local winds and dust.
The approaching trough brings some heavy rain locally to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rain of 1.5 cm is possible, which could lead to small debris flows and smooth roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in the rainy season.
Distributed tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening to Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more on Monday late in the day and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall until Wednesday.
In October, temperatures in the U.S. can fluctuate greatly, as the North Pole gets cooler, but the tropics stay quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sundays.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the continued summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the middle and eastern U.S., October is expected to start warm, with temperatures fluctuating anywhere around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York it can be 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chances are high at above-average temperatures in the eastern United States until mid-October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched one of the six television networks on Thursday for the poignant testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued, while broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday’s surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona senator Jeff Flake to investigate the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh was tasting her and trying to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an inspired testimony that he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
More than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen watched on Friday.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were not immediately figures available for the other networks broadcasting the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
For comparison, that’s about like a play-off of a football game or for the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers during the day of the hearing: an average of 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the audience remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras recorded Friday morning that protesters shouted at him when he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Commission hearing.
He stayed for a few minutes with eyes knocked down while he was being scolded, live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various channels broadcast everything live when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favour on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee by next week, something the Democrats of the minority are pushing for.
Flake was convinced by his friend Chris Coons, a senator and a Democrat.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of “a political game” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on the same front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying her proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s taxes was “absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for the shooting in which Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
Police interrogated Simpson and later stated that he had known that he had shot Wayde with the result of his death.
His security deposit is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The municipal coroner in East Baton Rouge published a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound in the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
Sports Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his “engagement and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was “broken” and “in shock” by Waydes.
“This is an event you always hope will never happen,” Wade says.
Volcano spit like in Mexico City
The ashes spit out by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater was picked up and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected rumble and vibrations several times.
On social media, photos of a thin layer of axle appeared on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity in the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, for the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale hit central Mexico.
The volcano, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists beat the riot police, while thousands took part in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote in Catalonia that split the region into two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists stopped by the riot police beating the agents with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later in the day, skirmishes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled up their bats to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sang: “Don’t forget, don’t forgive,” while their opponents shouted “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions continue to rise in the independence-minded region, one year after the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters expressed overwhelming independence, although the turnout was low and the people who opposed secession boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to stop the vote in the region’s polling stations, resulting in violent skirmishes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on site on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia’s prospects for independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties achieved an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was brief, it was difficult for them to build on their success this year, because many of their best-known leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in prison pending a trial over their role in organizing the referendum and proclaiming independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tensions are getting higher,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in detention since late last year, declared that he will take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
“A candidacy for the European elections is the best way to sue the decline of democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house rammed with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a Londonderry home.
The incident occurred Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
At some point, a crossbow may have been fired on the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers with Menga goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 games since he became manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team got on par with Hibernian.
Gerrard's team failed this season to win an off-match during the Premiership. They have to take on Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points ahead of them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston remains undefeated. The team has already won six games in a row in his division, and coach Holt has not suffered any defeat since he had Kenny Miler replaced last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
The team of Holt had long been able to achieve a lead before the first goal. After all, their direct way of playing caused all kinds of problems with the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halkett's headball, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team had the Rangers play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and confidently.
And that ultimately led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston created an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
At that time, the Rangers had been in possession for a long time, but the defense of the home team was unstoppable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had not yet had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had to avoid a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball to the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a push from his colleagues from Livingston.
Continuing advances reached Livingston's penalty area, but they were denied each time. Twice a penalty kick was denied, one after Halkett's attack on raider Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's 'Phenomenal' - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played without exception excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their playing style and the composition of their team has barely changed since their return to the highest regions, but especially Holt deserves a lot of recognition for the way he has swept the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall walked on the tops of their toes throughout the game.
However, the Rangers did not break through.
Even though they have often played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase wasn’t good enough (they only succeeded once to squander the home team) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better, because they are somewhere in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan is welcomed with mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a shining blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went to breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday (September 29).
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police invoked security reasons when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering for the mosque, but many sympathizers came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s policy and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died on the spot.
A few months ago, another cyclist died in a flight crime accident on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were in the process of identifying the man and informing his close family.
The road is closed in several places, buses are diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Prison of Long Lartin: Six guards wounded in order disorder
Six guards have been injured in a disturbance in a heavily secured prison for men, according to the prison agency.
The riots erupted Sunday at about 9.30 local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ guards have been deployed to resolve the situation, involving eight prisoners in one department.
The guards were treated there for minor injuries in the face.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed for an up-to-date incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We don’t tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible are referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had been treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were summoned to prison for a serious disruption of order in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Sudden Floods (With Potentially Positive Consequences for Drought Areas)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen at the beginning of next week. That's because the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is moving over the southwest of the desert area, bringing with it risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden flooding for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang just above Phoenix on Tuesday. Monday night it will already start to rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other parts of the southwestern desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 3 to 5 cm of rain, and here and there 10 cm are possible.
For those areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is very worrying, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map indicating current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa's trajectory reaches the mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 140 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening it.
Therefore, she is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday in the afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
There may be heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico, which entails a significant risk of flooding.
“Precipitation of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, up to 25 cm possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border Tuesday in the early morning hours as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The biggest danger expected of Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest of Sonora, and southwest of the desert area,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden flooding and debris flows in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stabbing wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured at about 4 o'clock local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition was “stable.”
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police ask anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered under the meanness, the anger” of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said during his nomination process, Kavanaugh has constantly “suffered under the meanness, the anger” of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the “American people saw the brilliant and incredible character, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that recognizes one of the most accomplished legal opinions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent track record,” he told the crowd of advocates in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“One of the most important elections in our lives will take place in five weeks.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part," he said.
"That's why I'm standing up for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats are on a mission to “oppose and impede us.”
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place by Friday, a top GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and toll is getting higher
In a major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many of the ground being wiped out when giant waves crashed on the beach, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a beach festival in the city of Palu, when waves of up to six meters high landed at the time it began to dawn. Many people fell and the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not immediately walk away and thus became victims of the tsunami,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Assistance (BNPB) during a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami also led to other dangers: it dragged cars, tree trunks, houses, hit everything on land,” said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami had traveled at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed into a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been twisted and collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to tremble with aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that had fallen on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has even increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some of the dead were trapped under the ruins of collapsed buildings, he said, about 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be even greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Donggala “is completely flat, we have no information at all,” Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement. The staff and volunteers of the Red Cross are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,” the Red Cross said.
The organization received a lot of criticism on Saturday for not saying that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
In amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the upper floor of a building crying out in panic at people on the street downstairs to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
Minutes later, a wall of water crashes on the coast and buildings and cars are dragged along.
Reuters was unable to verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military is currently dispatching relief aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is only reopened for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami Dodentol rises above 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala have safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees in the courtyard of their office seek shelter in tents of tarpaulin, but passed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses that had been destroyed,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups began the difficult task of initiating emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid workers with great expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, goods and personnel from abroad can only be admitted if the location of a disaster is declared a national natural disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can provide international assistance, but that status has still not been declared.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing people continued to hope that they would find their loved ones’ lives again, as in the miracles that people so eagerly hear about horrible natural disasters like this one.
A boy was taken out of a sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, relief workers liberated a woman who had been stuck under the rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students were also imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread to the paragliding community and that in the hours that followed, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who participated in the beach festival.
In his messages, however, only one grey tick appeared instead of two blue ticks.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 During ATM Supply in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport police.
The driver had just emptied an ATM into the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
While he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's co-worker and stole a bag of money ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects flee, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: “The creature that is formally known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been called Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced in the run-up to his performance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her performance during the show for “emotional reasons,” the show’s creator says.
Ye is not just an abbreviation of his current stage name. Earlier West said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I think “yes” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means “you,” West said earlier this year, when he told Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I am you, I am us, it is us.
I have switched from Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously worked with West, has already worked with and without the hyphen and the capital letters.
Mexican President Promises Not to Use Forces Against Citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, has promised never to use military power against civilians. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, military forces fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing as many as 300 people, during which time leftist student movements emerged throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often join criminal gangs due to unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
United States to double funding for A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount it spends on research from A.I., says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements about A.I. coming from various departments of the U.S. government, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for A.I.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030, the country wants to be the number one in the field of AI innovations.
“Doubling the budget for research on AI would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could lead to a doubling of the chances of the next major achievement for A.I. taking place in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s most important AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated American Othello's best player, and later he was manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese department.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology contests organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next contest would take place as it would help discover the next visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“China isn’t picking up on our best academics, the companies are doing that,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited the best powers from universities to work on A.I.
Lee said U.S. A.I. efforts would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“Anyone who holds a doctorate in the field of A.I. should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation of Natural Sciences gives financial support to staff from academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industry and academia partners in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, U.S. legislation that should lead to the creation of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has been on the decline for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia” to resolve a dispute with Greece that has been ongoing for decades and would no longer hamper Macedonia’s application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province that is also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country claims Greek territory. Consequently, Greece vetoed the inclusion of Macedonia in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalists believe that the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not sure that the required turnout of at least 50 percent will be achieved, so the referendum may not be valid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: ‘Do you support membership of NATO and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
“Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join agencies like the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that arose when the former Yugoslavia collapsed.
“I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have indicated that they will respect the outcome, making it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at the time was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of the registered voters came to vote.
“I come to vote because it’s important to my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
Before parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents placed by people boycotting the referendum.
“We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, and not through a backdoor,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that the vast majority of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said that a “yes” as a result would be “a confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70% would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came to power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes full defense of Brighton and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling shortened Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It seemed like a whistle of a penny, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was first handed the ball to the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, straight into the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He managed to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then gave a pass to the left, where Sterling waited.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
“Aguero has problems with his feet,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told the press.
“We decided to let him play for 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he stood deep in the playing field of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball with him for a while and then sent Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues player ticked the ball in just before it was too far.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League on Tuesday at 12.55 hrs. The match will take place in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Joker wants to play along and not make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated for the playoff, there was not much reason to force a new start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still consequences for the Rockies' participation in the play-off. They are currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies got at least one wildcard for the playoff thanks to their 5-2 victory against the Nationals last Friday, but now want to do everything possible to secure their first division title.
“Although there’s nothing left for us, we can at least pitch with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team will probably play at the highest level I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play into that?”
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be moving on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to put Scherzer on as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the pitching field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although that is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher stands on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to hold meeting in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
One of the most important elections in our lives will take place in five weeks.
This is one of the really big elections. I don't take part, but actually I do take part. That's why I stand up for great candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: “We see a terrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take power back, no matter what they're supposed to do, you see the meanness, the crap.
It doesn’t matter who they hurt, who they have to push away to gain power and control, that’s what they want: power and control, but we won’t give them that.”
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “oppose and hinder us.”
“And we’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad and mean and false and lying.”
He named the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Committee on Justice, which led to loud bullying from the public.
“Do you remember what she answered?
Did you read the document?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, that was no surprise.
After all, I’m the latest in a whole series of Labour MPs to get us to not be welcome just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received a similar treatment because she stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motion for censorship because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it stated: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
And that was the case during most of the GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I am already a local Labour Member of Parliament.
Unfortunately, today is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a “kinder, softer” politics has long been forgotten, if it had ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had a similar political outlook to me suddenly expected me to make a change and take a position that I would not otherwise have agreed to, from topics such as national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak in front of an audience, whatever I say, there are social media harassments that call for the rejection of my candidacy for the next election, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made to my address are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are dealing with a flood of sexist or racist reactions every day, but do not let themselves be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that severe harassment is apparently considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church, and with every “motion of mistrust” or change of selection rules, the party becomes more petty-minded.
For the past two years, I have often been advised to keep quiet, not just to speak my opinion loudly and then I would ‘not get in trouble’.
But I didn't go into politics for that.
Since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a schoolchild, provoked by the neglect of Thatcher’s government that literally collapsed my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a municipal councillor and in my role as a minister.
I have never kept my politics hidden, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clarity about my policy stances and my disputes with the current leadership.
To those who propagated the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country is dragging on towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, and it is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy for the next elections will not prevent me from acting according to what I believe is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unsuccessful Ayr on its way to the summit
Two late try's may have skewed the end result somewhat, but there's no doubt Ayr is rightly triumphing in this delightful game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated team of the ten.
Ultimately, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that gave the home team the victory, and coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied.
“We’ve had a hard time in our matches so far and we’re still unbeaten, so I’m a happy man,” he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: “All honour to Ayr, they have used their chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to a lead for Ayr, but due to a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (whom he got during the match of the Warriors) Melrose could speak the numbers and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
Climo gave Ayr an extra lead with a penalty and scored a conversion after a solotry just before the rest. So it was 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, followed by a conversion of Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match stopped for a long time for a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on a stretcher, and as soon as the match was restarted, Ayr could continue through a try from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion from Climo.
Then captain Blair Macpherson of Ayr got a yellow card, and again Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed a try of Bruce Colvine at the end of a game where the pressure was very high.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he tacked Climo without the ball, MacPherson after the advancing Ayr-maul provided a touch-down to the penalty-lineout.
Climo made the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's box kick and halfbacked Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran is from Still Game in the hospitality industry, apparently appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official data, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the “blowing restaurant business” in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia enclosed by country hopes the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a rigged naval office in La Paz.
Public buildings have an ocean-blue flag.
On all marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It is a duty to win them back.”
Throughout Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that the country has had to give to Chile after a bloody nineteenth-century commodity conflict is still alive, as is the desire to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may have reached its highest point in recent decades, as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the outcome with positive prospects,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the ruling of the Tribunal on large screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will plead in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of lively talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is facing a controversial battle for re-election next year, much is at stake with Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to allocate the Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible conversations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice falls only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And Bolivia’s prospects for a positive result have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have gotten worse over the past four years.
“The matter of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government,” Zárate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has completely undermined all the goodwill that Chile might still have, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to continue talking afterwards.
The two countries have not had ambassadors in each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court’s decision has been taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, uses the maritime issue as a political stool.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at a summit between rival leaders in Singapore.
He said this at the time that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart stagnating nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
Ri says it’s a “utopy” that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. objections to a statement ending the Korean war will one day bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the area of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and doubt that Pyongyang is serious when he says he would refrain from an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgear, for sale soon near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or keep the sun completely out of your eyes, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking move during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were indispensable from Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their dazzling creations on the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a gigantic beige hat decorated with a feather-like wide edge, which hung up over the models’ eyes.
Other oversized accessories were watermelon set with gems, a wizard hat and even a pineapple, but those are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
The lips of many of the colourful masks were sewn down, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like diving gear, complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow this daring fashion, you are lucky.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats are perhaps inspired by 'La Bomba', the scattered hat with a two-metre-wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared everywhere on social media also created another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost the size of the model in bathing suit that the bag was sailing with.
The red-orange raffia bag, lined with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather handle, was the most striking piece in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the stores next summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for extra big accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent track record in academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we can’t only rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest pass rates within independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
The data, collected from 74 schools affiliated with SCIS, shows that 72 percent of students achieved a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students German, 69 percent of students French and 63 percent of students Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now valued as much as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of the obstacles to filling out vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are becoming increasingly important to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more job vacancies requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, in the future he will have a real advantage with such a skill for life.
Communicating directly with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation. French was the only language that stood above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for today’s children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
Schools in Scotland choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be different languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, regardless of the future.
It cannot be denied at the moment that languages remain vital to the future of the country in a global business environment, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should actually be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It is very fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting for LeBron James’s first game at the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the six races prior to the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season matches to prepare,” he said.
Period of Trump’s election rallyes in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a long series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia
It’s Trump’s first of five planned rallies in the coming week, including stops in places he’s fond of, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote on the appointment of the candidate he elects for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been suspended, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump’s rally in West Virginia start tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online via the livestream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be talking about this week’s hearings for Supreme Justice Brett Kavanaugh. These were extra charged now that Kavanaugh is being charged with sexual misconduct and the Senate may be waiting for a week to vote on his appointment while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans who are candidates for the November elections to get more energy.
President Trump’s campaign leadership said these five rallies next week are meant to “stimulate volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters said.
“Congress control is so important to his program that the president travels to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman who did not want to be named told Reuters.
The rally tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is left behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive in the run-up to Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon were perhaps just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging sling of chances is a completely invented sport concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
So who gets the best chances right now?
“They had a six-point lead at first, and now that’s just four more, so we think luck is on our side right now,” Jordan Spieth said before he left at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of being in favour of four points, while there are still twelve in the game.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each scored three points of the four.
Spieth has been a fearful opponent of tea to green and he sets a good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well became louder as his round progressed and he achieved a crucial pit with which match four became a success when he and Thomas were two points behind after two matches.
His putt with which they won the game at 15, was followed by a similar scream, the kind of one that you can infer that he believes the American team has not yet been defeated.
“You have to dig deep and only worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delicious European duo has four in four and can do nothing wrong.
'Moliwood' was the only duo that didn't play a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of that series, and the way they seem to exchange energy with their noisy audience, they are the players to be defeated on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will be the most popular player ever to make a European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time with different holes.
However, it is premature to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short cuts with Sergio Garcia, the four-ball hero of that morning, when he formed a duo with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine led to a backlog for the Spaniard and the Swede who could no longer overcome them.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duos, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
The European team has played the best so far and has a nice lead in the run-up to the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to go into the fight, something that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a nice lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they are 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspiring duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two wins more than Tiger Woods, who had a hard time, leading them up to four points ahead in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, that wants the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine back, was stronger than the blunt Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two games, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points during Sunday’s 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed ‘Molliwood’ after a sensational weekend, are only the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup to win four points in their four opening matches.
After finishing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully matched and defeated a disappointing Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed a brilliant move, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world, with 2&1.
Yet it wasn’t like a sloping roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who already won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won 2&1 with Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch a four-point backlog at the beginning of the singles, although Furyk’s team has enough draws, as they currently hold the trophy in their hands.
But now that they have been in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high.
North Korea Says It Will ‘Never Unilaterally Disarm Without Confidence’
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are leading to increasing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could under no circumstances give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” over the past year, such as cessation of nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the site for nuclear tests, and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a similar response from the United States,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, rewarding North Korea as it moves forward, it noted that he did not a priori disapprove of unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang once did.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the very first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work toward the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is aiming for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to ease harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way and even by objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of war,’ Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of the people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions only reinforce our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the U.S. leader suggested at the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister instead emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other party to this issue of denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a deadlock.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was significantly different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles should be targeted on the U.S. mainland after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to completely destroy North Korea last year, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there is still much to be done and that the sanctions must continue until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable: “Whether it’s two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council’s sanctions must be continued vigorously and firmly until we have achieved the complete, definitive, verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously sanctioned North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Just hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea promised during a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take “corresponding measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had pledged in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year will help all students get more sleep, in an effort to combat the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night while drinking a lot of caffeine.
One professor found that the students of the world’s largest university often have no idea of the basics to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, prepared the course. As far as he knows, it is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a speech about the influence of lack of sleep on learning.
“At the end of my speech, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why can’t I hear this until my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is organized for the first time this year, explains to the students the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, students see an image of a dormitory, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise equipment and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and the way sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know what impact cigarettes have on their health, Czeisler added.
Continuing the culture of pride on a night-time basis still exists, he says, and due to modern technology and increasing pressure on students, sleep deprivation is an ever-increasing problem.
Ensuring enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes the brain to give them a constant sense of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from Calfornia who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to prepare the course, after all, he had taken lessons with the professor last year when he was studying at Harvard in his first year.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study program before they come to the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for their bedtime, not just an alarm to get up. They also need to be aware of the damaging effects of the ‘blue light’ of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which can make you have trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal destroys Gerrard's men
The Rangers saw their exit match again disappointing when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team beat 1-0 in Livingston.
Ibrox’s team hoped for a first win in an off-match since defeating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt’s team lost, barely Gerrard’s second as manager in 18 matches. His team is now eight points behind Hearts, which are further out at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third, with only a difference in number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could get even more trouble, since border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound after apparently an object was thrown at him by the fans of the visitor team.
Gerrard made eight changes to his team. They passed Ayr and went to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt stayed with the same team for Livingston, who managed to beat the Hearts a point last week. He would have been thrilled with the way his well-trained team managed to block off the opponents on each move.
The Rangers may have had the most ball possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in sight, but the midfielder couldn't finish it.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the back pole.
The Rangers managed to take control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than really believing in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos thought he was entitled to a penalty when he and Steven Lawless clashed after a quarter of an hour, but referee Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's request.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who used to be a goalkeeper at the Ibrox, could easily stop the headball of Lassana Coulibaly and the tame shot of Ovie Ejaria.
The opener of Livingston in the 34th minute may not be in line with the overall game history, no one can deny that they deserved this, even if it was just for their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were not able to cope with Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher handed the ball over to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who easily kicked the ball into the goal.
Gerrard interrupted Coulibaly/Ryan Kent, which had almost immediate consequences when the grand piano player passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston continued to force visitors to play a game the kind Livingston prefers, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased its lead in the final stage of the match, but McGregor stood well and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Invader Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked for a penalty kick at the end of the match after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson looked the other way.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from the almanac of our ‘Sunday Morning’: September 30, 1882, today exactly 136 years ago, for whom well can TELL... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm ‘Hans’ Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
The Geigerteller has since become an icon in pop culture as well, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the at first sight unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
He said, “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: ‘That’s a geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set up these headphones, you hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “It’s really popping now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malignant cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells in the context of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a lab.
They can then ‘see’ a protein that is common in many types of cancer and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine produces promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months
In the method, immune cells are removed in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted in such a way that they can ‘see’ the protein HER2, which often occurs in all types of cancer, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar way of removing immune cells from patients and ‘learning’ these cells to tackle cancer cells has already been shown to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.

It didn't go as he had hoped.
Kanye West was cast during a broadcast of Saturday Night Live after an incoherent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would become a presidential candidate in 2020.
After bringing his third issue of the evening, Ghost Town, with a cap on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he set a tirade against the Democrats and repeated that he supports Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump? He’s a racist!’
“If I was concerned about racism, I had long left America,” he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon hit the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony in the Senate Justice Committee in connection with the alleged assault Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
West's tirade wasn't broadcast, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock wants to take on West with his post.
West also complained to the public that he had been fired backstage for his cap.
“They kicked me backstage.
They said, “Don’t get on the stage with that cap.”
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm apathetic," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Would you like to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said that he would attract her superman-cape, ‘because that means you can’t command me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love.”
From the audience came at least twice bullshit and the castled of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety. The magazine was told by a attendee: ‘The whole studio was suddenly silent.’
West was guest as last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of our bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR THE MASSA.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was “just himself, and that’s beautiful.”
But I choose not to reward someone who supports and exposes an ideology that hurts my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We too,” she added.
Before the show began, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and from now on he is, he says, “the creature formally known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name. He was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg also carried the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The artist formerly known as Prince.
Allegations of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was stabbed Friday in a restaurant in eastern Belfast.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington takes on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor takes on the macho hero’s stereotype and says that when young boys see such roles on the screen, they often think they need to be tough to get respect.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and asked himself how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the epoch of “MeToo.”
Kit, who recently married his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted he is strongly convinced that the problem needs to be addressed.
“This is a really important question for me personally at the moment: where did our masculinity go wrong?” he said.
“What did we teach men when they grew up, which is why we are now facing this problem?”
Kit thinks that television might be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to his very masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is learned?”
What is taught on TV and on the street that makes young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that’s one of today’s big questions: how do we change that?
“There’s obviously something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones after the series ends next summer, because he is “ready with battlefields and horses.”
Starting in November, Kit plays in a revival of True West by Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he believes his meeting with his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife during the series, so that’s how I’ve kept my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the fantasy series that was awarded an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say it has affected more than 820,000 people in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not previously the case.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
According to the conservative values of land, an estimated 70 to 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted due to inadequate protection in the sexual relations in these relationships.
The Chinese government has been promising universal access to HIV medication since 2003 as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and pulls out into ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiracy theories’
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters denies allegations that one of her staff members has posted the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers’ Wikipedia page.
The Democrat from Los Angeles claims that the allegations are spread by “extreme right” contenders and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more mean lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and telephone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate commission hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct to Brett Kavanaugh, Supreme Court candidate.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicating the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office and contained the information of a Waters employee, Hill said.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and a blatant lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly came across criticism online, including by former White House press officer Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds angry,’ Fleischer wrote.
“You can see from this that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a congressman.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He shouldn't be rebellious.
He shouldn't question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of exaggerated anger at Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take Waters’ place in the midterm elections, also gave his opinion on Twitter.
“After all, if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are made known and that they are legally held liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.”
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to Brexit, and that does indeed seem to apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comic action films with a sluggish spy in the lead, which started with Johnny English in 2003 and was revived with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Is this airy self-atire about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English with bulging eyes and flexible facial features manages at least to send everything in a hundred, even with his second comeback. From his name you can already deduce that he is a general comic character that was conceived for cinemagoers in countries where one speaks a different language than English.
He is obviously the foolish secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr Bean and a touch of that guy who contributed one note to the theme song of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s TV spots (whom everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain chaos behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved how Johnny English approached a helicopter in his medieval armor and ticked the rotor blades against his helmet.
Atkinson can well show how much talent he has for physical comedy in this film, but the humor is rather weak and crazyly excessive, especially now that the "serious" movie series like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor seems to be meant for children rather than adults, and the mad disaster of Johnny English seems to me less original and focused than the non-text jokes of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, revealing the identity of all Britain’s active secret agents, to the great dismay of the agent in office, an unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That’s the drop that makes the bucket run over from the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson does her utmost with this character that reminds of Teresa May, but the script doesn’t offer much material to work with.
According to her intelligence advisors, she must use a retired spy, since every active spy is compromised.
And that means the stumbling Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic setting, but unofficially teaches undercover work. Here are fun jokes in the story, because English's espionage lessons remind us of School of Rock.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pitiful helper Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is captain of a submarine, a tumultuous and jovial role that lies below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
So the Batman and Robin of the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's blood-beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their odyssey of whimsical mad fun: dressed as waiters, they set a flashy French restaurant on fire, kick noise aboard Volta’s luxury yacht and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
For the latter, all registers are pulled open, but no matter how well-intentioned and turbulent the scene is, she is reminiscent of children's television.
It's not all very original.
And like the other Johnny English films, I ask myself: can the British film industry really not think of a role that honors Rowan Atkinson’s talent?
Labour denies that the party is devising a plan in which Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party would consider a radical plan in which Britons work four days a week but get paid for five days.
The party would reportedly want corporate bosses to pass on the savings they make as a result of the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day off.
This way, employees can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn the same amount.
According to sources, the idea “fits” into the party’s economic agenda and plans to overturn the country’s balance in the direction of the workers.
The transition to a four-day working week was already approved by the Federation of Trade Unions, which considers it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy revision is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not take place from one time to the next, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits within the party’s ambition to make the balance in the economy more beneficial to the workers and that also fits within the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given the fact that the Green Party has already promised a four-day week of work in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day work week is not a political intention of the party, nor is it considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to make his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy clear.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the “faceless drivers” and the “profiteers” at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get the full value of their shares back, as a Labour government could apply “discounts” based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees on corporate boards and to establish inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) that give 10 percent of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to 500 pounds a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question of whether the FBI’s findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview broadcast Sunday at 60 Minutes, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that could cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said before the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous."
However, Graham’s voice seems to be wall-mounted.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the accusation should contain dynamite," he said.
“As for Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has strongly denied,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see any new developments.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up of stars will perform and which has an equally impressive mission: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international advocates who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
Concertgoers who wanted to get a free ticket for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise generating awareness for the purpose of: ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with another 12 years to go to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another form of ‘clicktivism’, making people feel that they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, according to Global Citizen, more than 19 million “actions” of supporters have been registered, targeting a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have contributed to global leaders making more than $37 billion worth of policy proposals that need to change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had an impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK investors and executives, has pledged $35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, other national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice that is malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the UK government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced to support a project, the Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen’s website, which asked, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The group replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, where we will sometimes fall and fail.
But, just like civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will ultimately be successful because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are a few of the artists who will perform this year at the New York event hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may deploy the Navy for a 'blockade' to hinder Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
“Washington can resort to the navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East,” said Ryan Zinke, U.S. Home Secretary, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe they are only in the Middle East to trade in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counter this.
“The United States has that opportunity, with the Navy, to ensure that the sailing routes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not come to market,” he said.
Zinke spoke for guests at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that postulates itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approach to Russia with that of Iran, noting that these are not essentially different.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less using and replacing fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a country that knows only a ‘magic’, with an economy that relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to pull back vision from the “unfit” pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum of Berlin, has made Moscow’s “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double its current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we agree with the view that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industry organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'really thinks about it' to take part in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she is “thinking seriously” about taking part in the presidential elections after the midterm elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering taking part in the election.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington to restore the damaged government, and this also means a woman in the top position,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will start seriously thinking about electing myself as president.”
Warren acted against President Donald Trump at the town hall meeting and said he was “steering this country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is accomplishing in our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been frank in her criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said “of course we have to wait for an investigation by the FBI before we vote on this.”
However, a poll published on Thursday found that a majority of Warren’s own supporters do not think they should be elected by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not stand for election, according to an opinion poll from Suffolk University’s Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent agreed that she would be elected.
The study showed that there was more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent ahead of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with a possible participation in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin Talks About Track Palin's PTSD At Donald Trump's Election Meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after he entered service in September.
He was arrested and charged after a report of domestic violence Monday night.
"By what my own son is going through, what he's going through now that he's back, I have understanding for other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with," she told the audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said about her son and other veterans “they come back a little differently, they come back and have become harder, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military have given to the homeland.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and has been charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, interference in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 States Support Protest Against New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the US that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. filed a statement as “friend-of-the-court” to Washington’s court last Friday in support of an asylum seeker challenging this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case that the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August has not been disclosed.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" have abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The lawyers of the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people who apply for asylum in the US, as countries with major problems in terms of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals, which made it possible for undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine said Friday in a statement that the new policy “ignores tens of years of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle” is stated in the statement of the “friend-of-the-court”.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the U.S. harms the U.S. economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and provide the country with the necessary workforce.
Jeff Sessions, the minister of justice, ordered judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
“Asyl is available to those fleeing their country for persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political view,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems, even if these are serious problems that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she tried to comfort her feverish baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce.”
Residents returned to their ruined homes and searched for valuables in their wet possessions that they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overpopulated, as long as they have not been damaged by the 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside because of the risk of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed against the remains of a wall,” Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they are safe.”
US ambassador accuses China of ‘intimidation’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily touting the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump recently referred to the paid annex of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the most-selling newspaper in Iowa, after he accused China of interference in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, an accusation denied by China.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, according to U.S. officials quoted by Reuters, marked a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed ever higher import tariffs on each other.
China’s retaliation rates early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states like Iowa, who support Trump’s Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and previously long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had affected American workers, farmers and businesses.
“China,” Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now doubles the harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading this propaganda, the government of China makes use of freedom of expression and of a free press, a long-cherished tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at a kiosk in central Beijing, you will find in vain divergent voices and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic process, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has refused to publish its article,” if he didn’t say to which newspaper this was.
Through the Kavanaugh debacle, Republicans alienated female voters just before the midterm elections, analysts warn
With many leading Republicans flocking around Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court candidate, and defending him against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts warn that they will experience a setback, especially among women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this topic have grown enormous and most Republicans have already indicated that they want to continue the vote.
“These things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered if Senator Jeff Flake’s (Republican, Arizona) attempt to plead for an FBI investigation at the last minute would be enough to satisfy the angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted “November is coming!” during their demonstration in the Senate hall while the Republicans who controlled the Justice Commission chose to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high," Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go even further, especially among floating female voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who often don’t vote even though they disagree with the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, further elucidating her allegation of sexual harassment against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that there could be a setback if the Republicans pushed through the nomination.
“This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former Republican Party president, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in the committee, or the final vote or Kavanaugh taking place in court, but it’s also about the way the Republicans handled this and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats be elected, told the news channel.
However, the Americans turn out to be divided on who they believe after Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with a small majority standing out for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are sure or likely to believe Ford’s testimony and that 35 percent are sure or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh certainly or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s lead, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford said last week before the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals at a party during the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new internet to tackle Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the technology legend’s latest project, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that “world domination” is the guiding thought behind Inrupt.
“We have to do this now,” he said of the start-up.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology to enable people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can store lists of contacts, activity lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not going to have conversations with “Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that will completely upset all their business models at once.”
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the “mission [of Inrupt] is to deliver the commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
After the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and bearer of the Victoria Cross from World War I honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross as a soldier during World War I is honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann received the award following the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and thus never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the fact for which his grandfather had been distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under fierce fire of field guns and machine guns" on September 29, 1918.
He later stormed to the line of fire and led the line forward before running alone to a field gun and shutting down three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a real hero is evidenced by the support he receives from a large number of people."
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine, you stayed awake all night to watch a full-blown Bellator 206 and you don't get to see the most important moment.
The San Jose billboard featured 13 battles, including six in the main section, and this was broadcast all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, viewers in the UK were unpleasantly surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were indignant because they had stayed awake all night especially for this fight.
A fan described the transition to the children’s program on Twitter as “a bad joke.”
“According to government regulations, content that is not suitable for children should no longer be shown after 6:00 a.m., so we had to switch to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yesss."
Bellator company chairman Scott Coker said they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that viewers in the UK will also have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the back game, that we can solve this problem," Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can’t discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of texts went back and forth and believe me, these weren’t all equally friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can promise that this will not happen a second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' Because of His Sexual Orientation
Olympic incubator Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his sexual orientation during his youth, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to secondary school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In a conversation on Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that parenting had contributed to less value to winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Apparently as an outcast on Laverne’s first show, Daley said he felt “less” than others during his childhood because it was “socially unacceptable to like both girls and boys.”
“To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful.”
He wanted to prove that he was "someone" so that he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally found out about his nature.
The winner of two bronze Olympic medals has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said the fact that he fell in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you have to endure so much at a young age,” he participated in his first Olympics at the age of fourteen and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone in your own age group who has experienced the same highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his “whole perspective” had changed.
“If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had already gotten the tickets for London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, you won't be there to sit in the first row, pa," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stabbed and he died, I could finally acknowledge that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had been dreaming about this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first choice of music, Proud by Heather Small, which had taken a strong hold of him on his way to the games and which he still got chicken skin from.
Desert Island Discs can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his form again to avoid making it a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was placed on the bench by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, in an attempt to figure out what it lacks.
Because he was never even known for his straight drives at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the narrow fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs routinely punishes wandering balls.
And if the track in itself isn’t deterrent enough, Mickelson will face the ever-accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, who has been paired with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week in the ninth match on Sunday.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at the start of the 12 single matches, start well, Mickelson’s match can be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, even though it was hard to do otherwise.
“He fully understood the role he had today, hit me on the back, put his arm around me, and said he’s ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He has been included in the Hall of Fame and has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play only two matches.
I expected more of it, but it’s as it is and it’s the way we think we should act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will be able to improve Nick Faldo’s record for the highest number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never fully matched the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has won 18 matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal matches, but Furyk said his presence had a certain intangible impact on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he likes to make jokes with people and he’s a great guy to have on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players liked to fool him from time to time last week, that was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game.”
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that big lead can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead before the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup, can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dane made his debut in the game at Valderrama in 1997, where the team with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually passed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141-2-131-2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just,” Bjorn said.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not a match played yet.
Everyone will have to make a full effort tomorrow.
Get started and execute the plan on the right one.
It is not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and we need to keep our focus on that.
I keep saying, I’m focusing on the 12 players we have available, but we’re also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world.”
Rejoicing at the performance of his players on a tricky golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never anticipate the business in this area.
Another challenge awaits tomorrow.
Tomorrow the individual achievements will be discussed, and that is another very different discipline.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on your own, your abilities as a golfer are really tested.
That’s the message you have to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he must also get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform individually better than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas who won three of the four points.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this kind of turnaround on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miracle of Medinah'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had beeped his players for the last day.
“We have 12 important matches ahead of us tomorrow, but let’s try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medina.
When we have the momentum, there is a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We’ve aligned our line-up with this and we’re sending the men on the road in the order that we think is best and, you know, we’re going to try and get something out of the hat tomorrow.”
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the counter-offensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle order.
"I chose this group in this order because I think we are so constantly covered," Bjorn said from his selection of single players.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should have come into service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships of the Cold War era, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The vessel should have been part of the navy in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, which the Navy ordered in 2007, are used to replace the obsolete frigates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates up to two years in a row, far away from the home ports.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the advanced warships, which are intended to allow Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are commissioned, Die Zeit notes.
The fatal frigate F125 already made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial “software and hardware defects” that would render the warship useless if deployed in a combat mission.
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It also became clear that the ship is suffering from severe overweight, which will reduce its performance and limit the navy's ability to carry out further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as ships of a similar class deployed by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag for the entire project, including the training of the crew, is already a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering € 3.1 billion, compared to the original € 2.2 billion.
The problems that the latest frigates have in their grip are becoming extra important due to the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defence committee in Germany, acknowledged that the navy is actually “lacking employable ships.”
The official said the problem grew over time as a snowball because old ships were taken out of service but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were available to be included in the Navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bats
New research being conducted on an estate in the Scottish highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their quest for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, follows the common and small dwarf bat, the brown large-eared bat, and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the estate to monitor the activities of the bats throughout the season.
NTS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's cries and what kind does what.
A map of the habitat and a report are then produced to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser at the NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as making meadows and how best to maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and in the rest of the UK have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect sleeping places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, just like fly catchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not blind in reality.
However, their night hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
At the NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, bats are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, sleeper inspections, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve for bats in Scotland at the estate Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of Scotland’s ten species of bats live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for bats.
"Here in Threave we have a great environment for bats," he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But so much is not yet known about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of controlling bats before maintenance work is carried out, because the potentially unconscious destruction of a sleeping place can lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially eradicating a full local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and of many of our species, we simply don’t know yet how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault as his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo's allegations of sexual assault are classified as "fake news" and said that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the allegations have been published.
Portugal and Juventus are accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Via a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news” hours after the allegations were reported.
"No, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
“They want to promote themselves by calling my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by naming my name, but that’s part of the profession.
I'm a happy man, and by and by good," the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit in which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the allegations they called “inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the “moral damage for an amount corresponding to the severity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped her anally, as can be seen in the indictment filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was “99 percent a good guy,” but that he is sometimes abandoned that “one percent.”
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she was “afraid of the consequences” and worried about the “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old now says she wants to have the scheme invalidated because she has been permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and left to the Italian giant Juventus this summer in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret it' as car manufacturers leave
The UK “will forever regret it” if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily shut down production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis are manufactured by Toyota, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries in the European Union.
“My vision is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory shut down,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed their fears about the consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the car manufacturers are concerned about risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line runs on the ‘just-in-time’ principle, with parts arriving from suppliers in the UK and the EU every 37 minutes for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, turmoil can break out at the borders that the industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota could not store more than one day of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be shut down in that case.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relationship with the EU is “exactly aligned to avoid those border checks.”
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also seize this opportunity," he told listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be shut down, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would undermine the company’s competitive position and that this would eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and who is the representative of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, White House says
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred another week” as the fight over the Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian influence on the elections, links between Trump’s assistants and Russia, and possible impediments to the president’s process.
The question of whether Trump is going to dismiss Deputy Attorney General and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has kept the Washington gossip machine going for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to capture talks with Trump and to depose the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors circulated that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he “didn’t like” dismissing Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a Senate Justice Commission hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, would both testify.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, slowing down the vote in the entire Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's press chief, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There is no date yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I always want to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters had difficulty with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the scarcity of press conferences was not caused by an aversion to the “attentive” TV journalists, though, she added, “I will not deny that they are trying to attract attention.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any president does for him,” she said, without providing evidence: “We looked at the figures.”
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, “but if the press has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do that a lot and you’ve seen us do that a lot in recent weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, he made a frank and at times bizarre appearance for the gathered reporters.
Health Minister writes a letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland employees from other EU countries
The health minister has written a letter to the EU staff working in the NHS Scotland to express the country’s gratitude and wish for them to continue working at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for the decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
But at the same time, the UK government has also increased preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know these are uncertain times for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the NHS and provide benefits to the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering head injury
The line baker of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, underwent an emergency operation yesterday after suffering a head injury in the 31-27 lost game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of the Tennessean reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly before rest.
"He came to the sideline and fell down there more or less," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet about the type/size of the injury” and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was tackled a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, which made him tackled a total of 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when buying a home in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher taxes when they buy a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless according to new plans by the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in fees will be levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a home in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s success that attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable homes and narrate this on earners.
The increase in taxes is levied on individuals and firms that do not pay taxes in the UK, putting the extra proceeds in an attempt by the government to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which comes on top of the current charges, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and homes purchased for the rental, could be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to 120 million pounds per year in this way.
An estimated 13 percent of the new building in London is bought by people who do not live in the UK. This increases prices and makes it difficult for starters to get a foot on the house ladder.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have practically become "ghost cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson pleaded for a reduction in the fees to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it, and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable homes in order to restore the “housing shame” in Britain.
Corbyn has announced a striking series of housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to expulsion “without negligence.”
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the ‘British Dream’, that life will be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be repaired.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be as easy for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, to buy homes here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of ever owning a house has become too vague a dream, and the humiliation of living without a roof overhead has become too real.
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the boss of Sunderland, says it’s his “ultimate ambition” to ever become manager of Scotland.
De Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from northeast England, which currently ranks third in League One, at three points of first place.
He went to the Stadium of Light last summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“As a footballer, I wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B-team and the stocking was off," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“When I was a child, I often saw Scotland playing with my father at Hampden Park and it’s something that keeps attracting me.
However, that opportunity would only come if I was successful in managing a club.”
The predecessors of Ross as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to become the successor to these established names at a major club, previously he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me is currently measured by ‘Can I let this club return to the Premier League?’
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League,” he says.
“It’s not an easy task to achieve this, but I can’t see myself as successful until I bring the club back there.”
Ross has only been working for three years as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from on the brink of degradation to winning the Championship in the next season.
And Ross says he is now more comfortable than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a crossroads," he recalled from the moment he took over at Alloa.
“I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than just playing.
It sounds bizarre, because I did quite well, I earned pretty well and had some reasonable highlights.
But playing football can be tough.
There are many things that you face every week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the profession, but management just feels good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I’m real, I’m as good on my skin as I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, research reveals
The summer heatwave has increased revenues from British pubs that struggle to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw revenues rise by 2.7 percent in July, but revenues in restaurants were 4.8 percent lower, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consulting firm CGA, which has collected the figures, said: “Continuing sunshine and the fact that England took part in the World Championships longer than expected meant that July showed a similar pattern to June, when pubs had 2.8 percent more sales, with the difference that restaurants were now hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on beverage sales performed by far the best, with better LFL growth (like-for-like) than restaurants were down.
Pubs that are also aimed at selling food also suffered from the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people were just trying to drink.
In managed pubs and bars, beverage sales were 6.6% higher for the month, while food sales were 3% lower.”
Paul Newman, RSM analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since late April.
The weather and impact of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for revenue in the nightlife market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent decline in turnover year-on-year is particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the food-focused operators and only time will tell if the more temperate temperatures of August can give it so necessary rest.”
Total revenue growth in the pub and restaurant industry, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the UK’s revenue monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sectors, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operational groups, with a combined turnover of .9 billion, which is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some not over 11 years old, have a secret social media account, which they keep hidden from parents and teachers, reveals a survey
Survey of 20,000 High School Students Revealed Growth in ‘False Insta Pages’
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a ‘main account’ that they also show their parents
One in five children, fewer than 11 years of age, create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in “false Insta accounts,” a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
This news has heightened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean ‘main account’ that they show to their parents while also having personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally landed on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site discovered a teenager there who asked others to “rape” her.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and half admitted to having personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: “It’s troubling that so many teens are lured to create online spaces where they’re not found by their parents and teachers.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' in the Scottish Board of Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics, as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the track and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sports executives to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
“Eilidh enjoys a lot of respect in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election to the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help to govern the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could not walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "Today, a month ago, I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It has been terribly hard work, but I am now fully recovered, I have learned to walk again and do my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the support!”
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has shared online opinion with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the introduction of what’s called “the world’s most silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology producer Elvie has released an ironic, music-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump has to offer to battering mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn on a song that contains lyrics like, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see anything of it” and “In case you didn’t notice, these aren’t udders, these are my breasts.”
The chorus then continues, "Pumps, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's."
However, the ad, which was published on the company’s Facebook page, immediately caused an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has provoked hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say it condones the ‘horror’ of the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but in their case, the babies are taken away within a few days of childbirth."
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else remarked, “Of course, this is traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don’t we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another added, "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and one woman admitted that she found the song "hilarious."
“I think this is a genius idea.
I would buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit weird, but I didn’t look too much for it.
This is a genius product,” someone wrote.
Someone else had the following remark: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who suck (often in the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they're just 'cows'.
This advertisement is not positive or negative about the dairy industry at all."
At the end of the video you will see the group of women all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who flake sometimes feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes, and discreetly fits into a feeding bra, so women have the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are on flasks.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing flailing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to put the flasks and the associated challenges in the spotlight and at the same time show in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has hit the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Marta Jakubowski’s catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently relocated to tent camp on Texas border
The number of incarcerated migrant children has peaked, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policy introduced by the Trump administration makes it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country by signing up for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and the other adult members of their household would have to hand out their fingerprints and that this data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, stated in a testimony to Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
We are prosecuting these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials have introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of the start of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was previously the standard, according to the staff at the shelter.
Many of them will stand in court through a videoconference, rather than in person, to advocate their application for legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to the shelter staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child is struggling are ignored more often, because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the ‘occupying power’ of the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called on Syrian refugees to return, even as the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that “this will be dealt with accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred struggle until we have liberated all Syrian territories” from terror groups and from a “possible illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the conditions are favorable for their return and he accused “some Western countries of spreading irrational fears” leaving most refugees away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return,” he said.
“They are politicising a matter that should only be a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be available to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a large-scale attack from Russia-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that this agreement has “clear deadlines” and said he hoped the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who “will be wiped out.”
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate, hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee and said the panel’s work should be limited “to revising the articles of the current constitution” and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many ‘liberal’ viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely by an impeachment procedure and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever.”
At the moment, however, there are no signs of watch fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s prime-time viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during “prime-time,” compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of reviews for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers on nights with important news.
“This is a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, the director behind the ABC drama Designated Survivor, a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
There is entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the narratives coming from Washington can influence Roe v. Wade’s future or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or affect the status of the global economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond wanting to be a well-informed citizen, when you notice that you’ve been looking for six hours at a panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the “deep background” by Bob Woodward in his book “Fear,” which talks about Paul Manafort’s peacock leather jacket that has cost $15,000 (“a garment full of overconfidence” by Daniel Woodward) according to Washington.
I will never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
“What he’s doing to give you the idea that it’s a reality show is in part that he’s stuffing you something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, about the Trump show’s rotating role-sharing and daily plot changes (getting into a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un tonez).
You can’t afford to miss an episode or you have the idea that you’re walking behind.

"I remember doing all those weird shows, not so long ago, and people saying 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows into the most exciting midterm elections for the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th district sees an influx of money, thanks to a reorganization of a constituency that requires two sitting representatives to fight for the same seat.
The recently reclassified district of Pittsburg meets Democratic representative Conor Lamb, who acquired his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb must face another incumbent popular representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania’s old 12th district, which has a lot of overlap with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally classified (“gerrymandering”) in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a squad of campaign funding between the financial arms of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nipple victory in a well-looking special election for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump had conquered this district by 20 percentage points difference.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The U.S. is considering punishing El Salvador for aid to China and has abandoned it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with Panama’s President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs officials have decided to recall U.S. Heads of Diplomatic Missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the “recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” the ministry’s spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have become painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference that would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving to the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials announced that they wanted the conference to continue, making all possible penalties against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan is now for Vice President Mike Pence to give a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the government confers on the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three U.S. envoys have returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further ado, without harsh messages about Washington’s penalties.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who have agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who is also close to the government and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible opposition to the justice system, for which compelling evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller is also likely to focus his investigation on conspiracy between Trump and Russia in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If Congress changes color, Trump must justify himself before that institution, just as he is getting ready to turn back to the voters, and maybe he must justify himself before a jury in a court.
That’s a lot to say, and I don’t want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
Choices will have to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a "coup d'état" against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and therefore missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points and this accelerates or slows the inexorable advance of democracy.
Americans are currently facing several of these types of bend points.
What will we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the moment this magazine reported that he, last year, had suggested recording conversations with the president in secret and that he had speculated about the president’s suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
“How will we react if the FBI’s new inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and an unfair testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a very long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail by the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away 60 years later to light candles for the Sabbath on the table depicting a swastika.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers will visit Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first match of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use those results as a springboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal really has a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the game with the idea that there was something to win and came out of the game with a point.
Maybe we could even have won in the end, but seen throughout the game, an equal match is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half but when we came out in the second half we were the better team.
Next Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can score three points, but it is going to be a difficult game because they also had a good result in their last game. But if the audience stands behind us, I am sure that we can push through and that we can achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, from everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a feel-good factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. The training is good.
Hopefully we can push now, leave the last season behind and be successful again.”
Women can’t sleep because of fear of retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of participants in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about this.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps necessary to conduct this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not make your wishes known on time.
Work with your adviser and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Engage a financial advisor: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay for these expenses.
Your long-term care funding choices may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or deploy equity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles when insurance needs to be deployed.
Provide a health care proxy so you can appoint a trusted person who can oversee your medical care and can ensure that the professionals adhere to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Also consider a proxy for your financial matters.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure the invoices are paid if you can no longer do so yourself.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Capture these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
“It’s not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“Which medications are used?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes through.”

The victim, over forty, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, belly and hand.
Agents described the shooting, which took place at 2:30 BST, as a "random act."
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to continue to rise.
Since the means of communication have been turned off, the official authorities have not yet received any information from the regency of Donggala, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-strong earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Celebs and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km along the coast of northwestern Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the most important activities in the economy of the province of Central Celebs, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mostly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past hundred years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Fighting Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the heaviest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-scale Richter earthquake took place south of Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, causing a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 on the Richter scale struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of over 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed around 300 lives.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by crashing buildings.
2018: Several earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to temporarily strand.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-presidentship, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and offering opposition during the verdict, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took the phone from her.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su detention house with a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself “innocent, for sure” when asked about it, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, which is punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not the first time that Palin has been charged with crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of abusing his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case is now before the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016 after linking her son’s violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly left to his service in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale has led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been turned off while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place right next to the center of Celebes, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspect of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York demand the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, killing eight people, a rare punishment that has not been executed in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, used a hired truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who came on his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the intent statement demanding the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document submitted to the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for the sake of a racket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and preparation,” according to the prosecutors, and they described the way Sajpov carried out the attack as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sajfoello Habiboellaevich Sajpov has inflicted injury, damage and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the declaration of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been more than a decade since a case in the Southern District of New York called for the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been executed after being convicted two years earlier of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by means of the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to the court documents.
He let the detectives know that he felt good about his deed, be it the police.
Sajpov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room at the hospital, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the indictment of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was “of course disappointed” with the prosecutors’ decision.
“We think the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Sajpov’s defense had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to “mobilize a people’s army” during a protest at the Conservative Party’s conference today.
Ukip’s former leader said politicians should feel the “heat” of the Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested giving him the lead in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told participants at the Birmingham march that the UK would have “already been out” if Mr. Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling the highly divided ranks is underlined by two conservatives who are pro-Remain and who participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise on the run while being attacked by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Supporters insisted that she would continue and try to make a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to “throw chequers in the trash.”
He suggested that Farage should be knighted and should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he quit the service, we’d be out now,” Bone said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we need to throw chequers in the trash.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone pointed out suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Drop Chequers and listen to me."
In a targeted message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the “heat” if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with this.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic masses, he added: “I want you to light up our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has given us victory in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom again.”
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a two-hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists waved with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after the founding of this group on the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the House of Lords for Labour, joked about the security issues of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Think Well’ About Candidates for President
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “well-think about her candidacy for the presidency” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in west Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, Republican delegate who was co-chair of Trum’s campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been at the center of speculation that she might be fighting Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came to power.
An attendee asked her if she would stand for the presidency.
Warren responded that it is time for women to go to Washington to repair our defective government and that includes a woman at the top.”
Arrest after shooting Wayde Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the shooting of Wayde Sims, LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who was seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in the head and died from the consequences,” police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and is known to have been present at the crime scene, to be in possession of a firearm and to have shot down Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is held in detention at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him victory after orders from team
When Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that team orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost in the cold as he defended his position and Vettel invited his teammate to attack.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton ride in the crowds in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went a lap later in the pits and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on top after a wheel-on-wheel action that forced the Ferrari driver to reluctantly release space on the inside after a double movement in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was the leader of the race for a while, because he stayed with his race choice and aimed at a fast finish, so that he could catch up with Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth place.
In the end, he went to the pits in the 44th lap, after which he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen came fourth.
It's a hard day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me by.
The team has done their best for places one and two,” Hamilton said.
That was not a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday about the fact that she persisted not to be the source of Christine Blasey Ford’s leaked letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president wasn’t talking directly about the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Justice Committee. Instead, he let it be known that what happened in the Senate showed that people can be “meaningful, unkind, and untrue.”
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful show that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue,” he said.
“When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Do you remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't leak," he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter mentioning Kavanaugh’s allegations was sent to Feinstein by Ford and it was leaked in September, but Feinstein has denied her agency was the leak.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the commission.
“She asked me to be confidential and I treated it confidentially, as she had asked.”
But the president turned out to be disbelieving her denial and commented on it at the Saturday night meeting: “I’ll tell you something, that wasn’t a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all necessary means.
You see the meanness, the unkindness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to take power and get back control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have made up for the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had names with two goals leading by scores of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team side by side, before Dwyer brought the Giants back to command.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make up for a backlog on Friday night to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assist from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford gave the assist with which Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt took the lead for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants entered the first rest with a lead, when he made his second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team repackaged and Bouchard put them back on par with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game, late in the second period. He ensured the victory with the fifth goal for his team, halfway in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies as he makes sure hundreds can escape the earthquake in an airplane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died for ensuring that an airplane with hundreds of people on board could take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that subsequently caused a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks still plague the area and many are buried below the point in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild-moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was ready on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, before the helicopter had reached Palu.
“It breaks your heart when you hear it,” he added.
In the meantime, the authorities fear that the death toll could rise to a thousand, and the disaster control agency of the country announced that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is assumed that the death toll is still rising because many bodies were under the debris and have not yet been reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral ceremony will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a mother of 35, told Sky News: “Every minute bodies are brought in by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is involved in a race to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and he said to the soldiers present: “I call on all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation are completed.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline carrying out the flight that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one more man is missing after they previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger is missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members, after the plane hit the water during the landing at the Chuuk Islands airport.
Authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that everyone’s condition was stable.
What caused the crash and what the exact sequence of events is, remains unclear for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot across the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was approaching the airport very low.
"That's good news," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and some others managed to wade through the water that came to their feet to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he had a non-serious head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors who were working nearby on a shipyard also helped with the rescue work by taking people to the shore with an inflatable boat, before the plane continued to sink in the approximately 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that in the last twenty years 111 people have been killed in crashes of airlines registered with the PNG, but none of these relate to Air Niugini.
An analyst records the timeline of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor closed his requisition on Friday in the reopening trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used cell phone call data to capture the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received the location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police started talking to Sanford again.
Sanford stood in the witness bench on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he told him he was at Sanford in his truck that night, Sanford said he was “living because my truck was in Nashville at the time.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone data indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted his phone's texts, calls, and contact details some time after Chambers' death.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense begins on Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expects the jury to start deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is ‘conscious hiphop’?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip-hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and addressing social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make ‘conscious hip hop’ popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in Britain by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
A New York child mistress sues a couple for a 'racist' text
A New York child mistress sues a couple for resignation for discriminatory reasons after receiving a missent text in which the mother complained of “again such a black one.”
The couple denied being racist and called the lawsuit “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a negro woman when she met her on her first working day in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post newspaper, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman, Mrs. Maurice, dismissed when she realized her blunder, stating that her previous childhood wife, who was African-American, had done bad work, and that she therefore expected a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent home with a taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple to get $350 a day compensation for the 6 months she was hired to bake internally with the family, albeit without a contract.
“I want them to feel that you just don’t do something like that,” Maurice told the New York Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple bit off on the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they were afraid, insulted by her, that they could not trust her anymore.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Shut up.'
Comparing the lawsuit to “extortion,” Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was “in a very difficult situation.”
"Are you going to prosecute someone like that?
That is not so sympathetic,” the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to capitulate the couple on social media, where they are denounced for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared that the public would not have much interest in a talking bear, reveals newly emerged letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: "It's hard to get in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, before the first publication.
With what we now know about Paddington’s huge success, it’s very entertaining.”
She said that her father, who, before he was inspired to write the children’s book about a small toy bear, worked as a cameraman at the British BBC, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book felt “bitter sweet” after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very prominent member of the family," she said, her father was secretly proud of the eventual success.
She said, "He was a quiet, humble man."
“But because Paddington was so lifelike to him, it almost seemed like a child’s achievement; you’re proud when you haven’t done anything for it yourself.
I think he was about to experience Paddington's success.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he honored the bear himself for its success.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was taken to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
"Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was expected not to make it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad’s call came to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly working out and leaving her body.
She had died some time before and this process turned everything off.
I could only sit there knowing what was going on.
I couldn’t cry, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all sorts of people and families.
I had to be really big.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what trial she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I got an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Robbing women stick messages on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make a strong commitment to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys paste inspiring messages and phone numbers that people in need can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old and living in Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, tells us that her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.
“He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile illuminated every room.”
Still, he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after robbing himself of his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried about a chain reaction."
Mrs. Davis made the cards; "to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't be silent - talk about it."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davies for years, lost Mark who was her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt gloomy or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was sitting all the way to the ground on Christmas Day - when the kids took out their gifts, he didn't look at them at all or anything.
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to deal with it: “It tears the whole family apart.
It drives us apart.
But we all have to go ahead and keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Uncertain as FBI Investigation Begins
"I thought that if we could indeed get what he asked for; an investigation limited in time and size, we might be able to create a little more unity," Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was 'distinguishing' in the midst of a firmly anchored stalemate within the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are already in five weeks, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are doing badly, their attempts to get their husbands elected in the country’s highest court are seriously complicated.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus got to know his wife Ashley, who the Bush was his personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI gets the report done?
Then there will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the defining vote to confirm Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean robbers to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-sug, which quotes from data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, states that last year there were 1,127 robbers, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for smugglers, are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
In the end, the vast majority of North Koreans are offered the South Korean nationality.
According to Seoul sources, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which has the longest outer border with North Korea and where it is easier to cross than in the heavily demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers the migrants more illegal than refugees and often expels them by force.
Relations between North and South, which are formally still in a state of war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, mainly talking about the stagnant negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, broadly agreeing to work towards the nuclear dismantling of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of lack of progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
“Without faith in US action, confidence in our national security is also lacking, and under those circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him incapable of serving in Supreme Court
House President Nancy Pelosi called U.S. Supreme Court Candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and finds him incapable of serving in Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotive; he sometimes almost screamed and was especially upset when he told about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him “grotesque and coordinated character murder” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was unfit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,” Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when she was asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth in Congress, or against the FBI, he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for the court he’s serving now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District of Columbia District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democrat that Kavanaugh would go against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade because Kavanaugh is known as a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh circumvented questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to stand and cheer if a hysterical, biased person is now appointed to the Supreme Court," Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit it.
It’s a just tirade of months and years of uprooted anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
“We’re going to cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s weird, do you?”
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a leader somewhere and who said that she too would cry when she got angry. She developed a method, where she would cry every time she got angry. To the one she spoke to, she said: 'You may think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are partially permitted as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best kept memories from a former job, in a male-dominated office, was when I had to cry terribly because I was so angry. An older woman, a cool businesswoman that everyone was a little scared of, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and are glad they got you on the closet.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart on his candidacy for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called 'Monkey Business' (formally meaning 'cats' or 'apenstretching') and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt that there was no reason why she would not run for a candidate.
“It wasn’t an informed decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race, and the last they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign was already advanced, she lagged behind with fundraising, so she solemnly promised not to join if she could not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, wanted to give her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not start a formal campaign anyway, she was so overwhelmed by feelings – of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger over sexism – that she suffocated into it.
“It would have been thought that I had a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the media reacted to her.
“They probably thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my tombstone?
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Can Benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a gap between the two countries could, according to experts, be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by raising taxes on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was announced this week when new effective, increased tax rates were unveiled for 200 billion dollars (150 billion euros) of goods; half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has taken reprisals in kind every time, most recently by raising rates from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the US every time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to blink quickly.
In order for Washington to bow, requests must be granted, but publicly bowing to the US is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays it smart, the trade war with the US could positively support China in the longer term, as the reciprocal dependence of the two economies decreases.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could put either country in economic freefall is actually far more dangerous than spectators have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues that focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war lasting more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that conditions in his country were improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, and to normalize the situation on the spot.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still about six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course Le Golf National southwest of Paris in France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn achieved the required number of 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was struggling almost the whole tournament, landed his long blow from the tee in the water at par 3, hole 16, and admitted his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shined in all his laps and became one of four players who ever scored 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest scoring of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, playing with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest ranked player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole playing by Ian Poulter from Great Britain, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Segrio Garcia, veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
“I’m not crying so fast, but today I can’t do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas that he chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It’s about the team, and I’m glad I could help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot, John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole to go in the game for singles on Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel because I beat Tiger Woods, and I followed that guy as I grew up," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic of one of the greatest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level throughout the tournament.
The American captain, Jim Furyk, said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they’ve fought.
This morning we made Europe a little more difficult.
We resisted.
All respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup. I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to the opponent.
We're overplayed."
