"As a state based on the 'Winner takes all' principle, Florida gave all fifty electoral votes to Romney, thus pushing him to the top of the Republican Party's nomination race."
Organizers of the protest said that in German cities such as Berlin, Cologne, Hamburg and Hanover about 100,000 people participated.
In Berlin, police estimated the number of protesters at 6,500.
There were also protests in Paris, Sofia in Bulgaria, Vilnius in Lithuania, Valletta in Malta, Tallinn in Estonia and Edinburgh and Glasgow in Scotland.
About 200 people protested in London in front of the offices of several major copyright holders.
Last month there were major protests in Poland when the country signed the ACTA, which led the Polish government to decide not to ratify the agreement for the time being.
Both Latvia and Slovakia have postponed the ACTA accession process.
Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are calling for surveillance cameras to be installed in all Australian slaughterhouses.
RSPCA New South Wales Chief Inspector David O’Shannessy told ABC that monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses in Australia should be on the agenda.
“Video surveillance would certainly send a clear message to the people who work with animals that their well-being is most important.”
The U.S. Geological Survey’s international earthquake map showed no earthquakes in Iceland the week before.
The Icelandic weather service has also not detected any earthquake activity in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours.
The significant earthquake activity that led to the phase transition took place on March 10 on the northeast side of the volcano’s summit crater.
Dark clouds unrelated to any volcanic activity were reported at the foot of the mountain.
The clouds made it unclear whether there had been an eruption.
“The Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel on board when they got into distress and the strong winds and waves pushed them against the wavebreakers.”
The twelve crew members were rescued with helicopters and the only injury was a broken nose.
The 100-meter-long ship was on its way to pick up its usual cargo of fertilizer, and the authorities had originally feared that a cargo might leak.
The proposed amendment was approved by both chambers in 2011.
A change occurred during this legislature, when the second sentence was first removed from the House of Representatives and then passed by the Senate in a similar form on Monday.
The failure of the second sentence, which proposes to ban same-sex registered partnerships, could potentially open the door to registered partnerships in the future.
Following the process, HJR-3 will be reviewed by the next elected legislator either in 2015 or 2016 to remain in the process.
Vautier’s achievements apart from filmmaking include a hunger strike in 1973 against events that he regarded as political censorship.
French law was changed, and his activism began in World War II when he was 15 years old and joined the French resistance.
He has documented himself in a book from 1998.
In the 1960s, he returned to Algeria, which had just become independent, to teach directing.
Japanese Judoka Hitoshi Saito, a double Olympic gold medalist, has died at the age of 54.
The cause of death was intrahepatic gall cancer.
He died Tuesday in Osaka.
Saito was not only a former Olympic and world champion, but also the chairman of the training committee of the All Japan Judo Association until his death.
At least 100 people had attended the celebration to celebrate the first wedding anniversary of a couple whose wedding took place last year.
A formal anniversary event is planned for a later date, officials said.
The couple had married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.
The 30-year-old husband, who was born in Buffalo, was one of four killed in the shooting, but his wife was not injured.
Karno is a well-known but controversial English teacher who taught Modern Education and King's Glory and is said to have had 9,000 students at the height of his career.
In his notes, he used words that some parents thought were derb, and in class, he allegedly used swear words.
Modern education accused him of having big advertisements put on buses without permission and lying when he said he was the presiding English tutor.
He had already been accused of a copyright infringement, but was not sued.
One former student said that he “used colloquial language in class, taught flirting techniques in comments, and was simply a buddy of the students.”
Over the past three decades, China has developed a market economy, although it has officially remained a communist state.
First economic reforms were carried out under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China’s economic power has increased by ninety times.
China exported more cars for the first time last year than Germany and replaced the United States as the largest market for this industry.
China’s gross domestic product could surpass that of the United States within two decades.
Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth named storm of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed in the eastern Atlantic.
In the storm, about 3000 miles from Miami, Florida, maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (64 km/h) are measured.
Scientists at the National Hurricane Center predict that Danielle will rise to a hurricane by Wednesday.
As the storm is still far from invading the country, it is still difficult to estimate the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean.
Bobek, born in the Croatian capital Zagreb, quickly became known while playing for Partizan Belgrade.
He joined it in 1945 and remained there until 1958.
During his time in the team he scored 403 goals with 468 stakes.
No one else has ever made more stakes or scored more goals for the club than Bobek.
He was named the best player in Partizan's history in 1995.
The celebrations began with a special show by the world-famous group Cirque du Soleil.
This was followed by the State Symphony Orchestra Istanbul, a Janitscharenkapelle and the singers Fatih Erkoz and Müslüm Gürses.
Then there were turning dervishes.
The Turkish diva Sezen Aksu performed with the Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
"Finally, the Turkish dance ensemble Fire of Anatolia offered the demonstration of 'Troya'."
Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old motorcycle racer, died after being involved in an accident on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
During his warm-up lap, Lenz fell off his motorcycle and was then run over by his racing colleague Xavier Zayat.
He was immediately taken care of by the medical staff at the racetrack and transferred to a local hospital, where he later died.
Zayat was not injured in the accident.
Concerning the global financial situation, Zapatero added that “the financial system is a part of the economy, a vital part.
“We have a one-year financial crisis that has had its most intense moment in the past two months and I think the financial markets are starting to recover.”
Naked News announced last week that it would significantly expand its international mandate for foreign language reporting with three new programs.
The global organization, which already reports in English and Japanese, starts broadcasting programs in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, internet and mobile devices.
“Fortunately, nothing happened to me, but I saw horrible scenes when people tried to knock windows to get out.
People hit the glass panes with chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.
One of the slices eventually broke and then they began to climb through the window,” said survivor Franciszek Kowal.
Through the energy produced when hydrogen atoms are fused (or fused) to form heavier elements, stars emit light and heat.
Scientists are working to develop a reactor that can generate energy in the same way.
However, this is an extremely difficult task, so it will take many years before actually usable fusion reactors are built.
Because of the surface tension, the steel needle floats on the water.
Surface tension arises because the water molecules on the water surface attract each other more than they are attracted by the air molecules located above them.
The water molecules form an invisible layer on the water surface, allowing objects like the needle to float on the water.
The runner on a modern skate has a double edge with a concave indentation in between. The two edges allow a better hold on the ice, even if tilted.
Because the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, the edge that is in contact with the ice also curves when the blade tilts from one side to the other.
When the skates tilt to the right, the skate turns to the right, and when the skates tilt to the left, the skate turns to the left.
To return to their previous level of energy, they must get rid of the extra energy they have received through the Light.
They do this by emitting a tiny particle of light called a “photon.”
"Scientists call this process 'stimulated emission of radiation' because the atoms are stimulated by bright light, thereby leaving a photon, and light is a kind of radiation."
The next picture shows how the atoms emit photons. Of course, the photons are actually much smaller than in the picture.
Photons are even smaller than the stuff that atoms are made of!
After hundreds of hours of operation, the filament in the light bulb burns out at some point and the light bulb no longer works.
The light bulb must then be replaced. It is necessary to be careful when replacing the bulb.
First, the switch of the lamp must be switched off or the cable connection must be interrupted.
The reason for this is that the current that flows into the holder for the metal part of the light bulb can give you a strong surge of current when you touch the inside of the holder or the metal base of the light bulb while it is still partially in the holder.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which pumps the blood.
Blood flows from the heart into vessels called arteries and returns to the heart in vessels called veins, the smallest vessels called capillaries.
The teeth of a triceratops were able to crush not only leaves, but even very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists think that Triceratops ate palm ferns, a plant species that was common in the Cretaceous period.
These plants look like small palm trees with a crown of pointed, sharp leaves.
A triceratops might have used its strong beak to remove the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists argue that these plants were very toxic and therefore probably not a dinosaur would have eaten them, although today the sloth and other animals, such as parrots (which are descended from the dinosaurs), can quite eat toxic leaves and fruits.
If you were on the surface of Io, you would weigh less than on Earth.
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on Io, so gravity naturally draws less on one.
Unlike the earth, the sun does not have a crust to stand on. The entire sun consists of gases, fire and plasma.
The farther away from the center of the sun, the thinner the gas becomes.
"The outer area we see when we look into the sun is called the photosphere, which means 'ball of light'."
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope and observed that Venus, like the moon, has phases.
Phases occur because only the side of Venus (or the moon) facing the sun is illuminated. The phases of Venus support the theory of Copernicus that the planets orbit the sun.
A few years later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks observed a Venus transit.
England had experienced a long period of peace after the reconquest of the Danelag.
In 991, however, Ethelred faced a Viking fleet larger than any other since Guthrim's a century earlier.
This fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian with the ambition to regain his land from Danish rule.
After initial military setbacks, he was able to agree on conditions with Olaf, the latter returning to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with alternate success.
Hangeul is the only deliberately invented alphabet used by many people today. The alphabet was invented in 1444, during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450).
King Sejong was the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty and is one of the most revered.
Originally, he called the Hangeul alphabet Hunmin Jeongeum, which means “the right sounds for teaching people.”
There are many theories about the origins of Sanskrit, one of which is about the immigration of the Aryans from the West to India, who brought their language with them.
Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to Latin spoken in Europe.
The oldest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. According to the collection of the Upanishads, Sanskrit withdrew for hierarchical reasons.
Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language that served as a source for many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages such as French and Spanish.
After the battle for France ended, Germany prepared for the invasion of the British island.
Germany gave the attack the nickname "Company of Sea lions". The majority of the heavy weapons and supplies of the British army had been lost in the evacuation from Dunkirk, so the army was rather weakened.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy and could have destroyed any invasion fleet that would have been sent over the English Channel.
However, very few Royal Navy ships were stationed near the likely invasion routes, as the admirals feared that they might be sunk in a German airstrike.
Let us begin with an explanation of the Italian plans: Italy was first and foremost the 'little brother' of Germany and Japan.
It had a weaker army and a weaker navy, although four new ships were built just before the war began.
The main targets of Italy were African countries. To conquer these countries, they needed a starting point for the troops to sail across the Mediterranean and invade Africa.
They had to eliminate British bases and ships in Egypt, but Italy’s battleships had no further role to play.
Now to Japan. Japan was an island state, just like Britain.
Submarines are ships designed to sail underwater and stay there for a longer period of time.
Submarines were used in the First and Second World Wars, when they were very slow and had a very limited shooting range.
At the beginning of the war, they mostly moved on the surface of the sea, but as the radar evolved and became more accurate, the submarines were forced to dive in order not to be seen.
The word submarine was also used in the version "U-Boat" in English, which meant specifically German submarines. The Germans were very good at navigating and controlling their submarines.
Due to their success with submarines, the Germans after the war were not trusted to own many of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamun, sometimes referred to as “King Tut” or “The Boy King”, is today one of the most famous ancient Egyptian kings.
Interestingly, it was not considered very important in antiquity and was not listed on the oldest royal lists.
However, the discovery of his burial chamber in 1922 made him a celebrity. While many ancient tombs were robbed, his tomb remained almost untouched.
Most of the objects with which Tutankhamen was buried are well preserved, as well as thousands of artifacts made from precious metals and rare stones.
With the invention of the spoke wheel, the Assyrian chariots became lighter, faster and better able to overtake soldiers and other chariots.
Arrows from their deadly crossbows could pierce the armor of enemy soldiers. About 1000 BC, the Assyrians introduced the cavalry.
A cavalry is a force that fights on horseback. Since the saddle was not yet invented, the Assyrian cavalry fought from the bare back of their horses.
We know many Greek politicians, scientists and artists. Perhaps the most famous person of this culture is the legendary blind poet Homer, who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey".
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still popular dramatists, and their plays are among the greatest works in world literature.
Another well-known Greek is the mathematician Pythagoras, who is mainly known for his famous teaching on the aspect ratios of rectangular triangles.
There are different estimates of how many people speak Hindi, and it is estimated that Hindi is the second to fourth most spoken language in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether or not very closely related dialects are counted.
Estimates range from 340 to 500 million speakers. Up to 800 million people understand the language.
Hindi and Urdu have a similar vocabulary, but a different script; in everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.
Around the 15th century, North Estonia was under great cultural influence from Germany.
Some German monks wanted to bring God closer to the native people and thus developed the Estonian written language.
It was based on the German alphabet and a letter was added, namely ''/''.
Over time, many words that had been borrowed from German merged, which was the beginning of the Enlightenment.
Traditionally, the heir to the throne went directly to the military after the end of school.
Charles, however, studied anthropology and archaeology, later also history, at Trinity College in Cambridge and graduated at 2:2 (a degree without special distinction).
Charles was the first member of the British royal family to receive a university degree.
The European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula) accounts for 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey with a length of more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) and a width of 800 kilometers (500 miles) resembles a rectangle in its shape.
Turkey's territory, including the lakes, covers 783,562 square kilometers (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are located in Southwest Asia and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey’s area makes it the 37th-largest country in the world and is about the size of the European part of France and the United Kingdom combined.
Turkey is surrounded on three sides by seas – the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean Sea to the south.
Luxembourg has a long history, but it has only been independent since 1839.
Today's parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s.
Although Luxembourg had always tried to remain a neutral country, it was occupied by Germany during both World War I and World War II.
Luxembourg became a founding member of the organization in 1957, now known as the European Union.
The Drukyel-Dzong is a fortress ruin and Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the Paro district (in the village of Phondey).
It is said that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress in 1649 to commemorate his victory against the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
In 1951, a fire caused only a few remnants of the Drukyel Dzong to survive, including the image of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.
After the fire, the fortress has been preserved and protected and remains one of Bhutan’s most sensational attractions.
During the 18th century, Cambodia was ensnared between two powerful neighbors – Thailand and Vietnam.
The Thais invaded Cambodia several times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.
The Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia in the last years of the 18th century.
Eighteen percent of Venezuelans are unemployed and most of the workers work in the shadow economy.
Two-thirds of working Venezuelans work in the service sector, almost a quarter in industry and a fifth in agriculture.
Petroleum is an important industry for Venezuelans. Although only one percent of the workers work in the oil industry, the country is a net exporter.
Early in the nation’s independence, Singapore’s botanical garden expertise helped transform the island into a tropical garden city.
Vanda Miss Joaquim, an orchid cross, was named the national flower of the country in 1981.
Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores move into the southern plains and cross the Mara River from the northern hills due to the rainfall.
And then back to the north through the west, with a new crossing of the Mara River after the rains in April.
Serengeti includes Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Reserve and Maswe Wild Park in Tanzania, as well as Maasai Mara National Park in Kenya.
To learn how to create interactive media, conventional and traditional skills are required as well as tools learned in interactive courses (storyboarding, audio and video editing, storytelling, etc.).
Interactive design requires you to question your assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
An interactive design requires that the components of a project connect with each other, but that they also make sense as separate units.
The disadvantage of zoom lenses is that the focusing and the number of lens elements required for a focal length range are much greater than for lenses with a fixed focal length.
This problem is becoming increasingly insignificant as lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in lens production.
As a result, zoom lenses were able to produce images in a quality comparable to that of fixed focal length lenses.
A further disadvantage of telephoto lenses is that the maximum aperture (the speed) of the lens is usually lower.
Therefore, cheap zoom lenses are difficult to use in situations with little light without flash.
One of the most common problems with converting a movie to DVD format is tapping.
Most televisions are made to please the general public.
Therefore, in everything you see on the TV, the edge is cut off at the top, bottom and sides.
This is to ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This is called an overscan.
Unfortunately, the margins are most likely cut off when you make a DVD, and if the video shows the subtitles too close to the bottom, they won’t appear completely.
The traditional medieval castle has long inspired the imagination and evokes images of tournaments, banquets and Artus knighthood.
Even standing between a thousand-year-old ruins, it is easy to imagine the sounds and smells of long-past battles, to almost hear the horseshoe on the cobblestone and to smell the growing fear in the dungeons.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why were castles built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
As was typical of the time, Kirby Muxloe Castle is more of a fortified house than a real castle.
Its large glazed windows and thin walls would not have been able to withstand a targeted attack for long.
In the 1480s, when Lord Hastings began to erect it, the country was quite peaceful and defense was needed only against small bands of roaming marauders.
The balance of power was a system in which the European nations sought to maintain the national sovereignty of all European states.
The concept was that all European nations had to try to prevent a nation from becoming powerful, so the national governments changed their alliances to maintain balance.
The Spanish Succession War was the first war whose main problem was the balance of power.
This marked an important change, since the European powers could no longer use the excuse of fighting religious wars, so the Thirty Years’ War was the last war labelled as a religious war.
The Artemis Temple in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C. in an act of arson by Herodstratus.
According to history, his motivation was in fame at all costs. The angry Ephesians declared that Herostratos' name would never be recorded.
The Greek historian Strabo later wrote down the name, which is why we know it today. The temple was destroyed the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander offered to pay for a new temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.
Make sure your hand is as relaxed as possible and you can still hit all the sounds correctly. Also, try not to make unnecessarily large movements with your fingers.
Remember that it is not necessary to hit the keys with a lot of force to achieve additional volume, as is the case with the piano.
To increase the volume on the accordion, use the bellows with more pressure or speed.
Mysticism is the pursuit of communion, identity, or conscious mindfulness related to a ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God.
The believer strives for a direct experience, intuition, or insight into divine reality/deity or deities.
The followers pursue certain lifestyles or practices that are intended to promote such experiences.
Mysticism differs from other forms of religious belief and worship in that the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness is in the foreground. This is especially true for those forms with a peaceful, insightful, blissful or even ecstatic character.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent. It originated in the 15th century in the Panjab from a secession of Hinduism.
Sikhs regard their faith as an independent religion of Hinduism, although they acknowledge its Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which means “the path of the Guru” in Panjabi. The Guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it has taken on a meaning that is at the core of the Sikh faith.
The religion was founded in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539).
In June 1956, however, Khrushchev's promise was put to the test when riots in Poland, where workers protested against food shortages and wage cuts, developed into a general protest against communism.
Although Krushkov eventually sent tanks to restore order, he gave in to some economic demands and agreed to appoint popular Vladyslaw Gomulka as the new prime minister.
The Indus Valley Civilization is a Bronze Age civilization in the northwestern Indian subcontinent that encompassed most of present-day Pakistan and some regions in northwestern India as well as northeastern Afghanistan.
This civilization flourished in the basin of the Indus, from which its name is derived.
Although some scholars believe that civilization should be called Indus Sarasvati civilization, as it also existed in the basin of the now dried-out Sarasvati River, while others call it Harappan civilization – after Harappa, the first of its sites excavated in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire helped to develop medical advances.
Doctors were recruited by Emperor Augustus and even formed the first Roman medical force for use after battles.
The Roman surgeons knew several sedatives, including morphine from poppy seeds and scopolamine from the seeds of nightshade plants.
They mastered amputations to save patients from wound burns, as well as pressure bandages and artery clamps to contain blood flow.
Over several centuries, the Roman Empire enabled great advances in medicine and shaped much of our current knowledge.
Pureland Origami is an origami with the restriction that it can only be folded once. More complex folds such as reverse folding are not allowed and all folds have simple positions.
It was developed by John Smith in the 1970s to help people who are inexperienced in wrinkling or have limited motor skills.
Children develop racial consciousness and racial stereotypes quite early on, and these racial stereotypes affect behavior.
For example, children who identify with an ethnic minority who are said to not perform well in school tend to be poor in school once they become aware of the stereotype associated with their ethnicity.
MySpace is the third most popular website in the United States and currently includes 54 million profiles.
These websites have caused a lot of interest, especially in the education sector.
There are positive aspects to these sites, including the ability to easily set up a class page that can include blogs, videos, photos, and other features.
This page can be easily accessed by simply providing a web address, making it easy for students who may have difficulty using the keyboard or spelling to remember and type in.
It can be adapted so that it is easy to read, and also with as much or as little color as desired.
Attention deficit syndrome “is a neurological syndrome whose classically descriptive symptom trio includes impulsivity, distractibility and hyperactivity or excess energy.”
"It's not a learning disability, it's a learning disability; it's "involving 3 to 5 percent of all children, maybe as many as 2 million American children."
Children with ADHD have difficulty focusing on things like schoolwork, but they can focus on things they enjoy, such as playing games, watching their favorite cartoon series, or writing sentences without drawing.
These children tend to get in a lot of trouble because they “behave risky, get into fights, and challenge authority persons” to stimulate their brains, as their brains cannot be stimulated with normal methods.
ADHD affects relationships with peers because other children cannot understand why they behave in this way, why they spell so or why their degree of maturity is different.
As the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn changed as described above, the basic rate of knowledge acquisition also changed.
The approach to obtaining information was different. The pressure was no longer in individual memory. Rather, the ability to remember texts came into focus.
At its core, the Renaissance caused a significant change in the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, hominids no longer use their hands to move around, carry loads, or swing through trees.
The hand and foot of the chimpanzee are of similar size and length, which reflects the use of the hand for weight loading during ankle gait.
In humans, the hand is shorter than the foot, with the phalangs being straighter.
Fossilized hand bones, whose age is two to three million years, show this change in the specialization of the hand from means of transport to the gripping tool.
Some people believe that the experience of many artificially generated lucid dreams can often be very tiring.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that the clarification dreams lead to longer time intervals between the REM phases.
With fewer REM phases per night, the state in which you experience real sleep and your body recovers becomes so rare that it becomes a problem.
This is just as exhausting as waking up and watching TV every twenty or thirty minutes.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to dream lucidly every night.
Within a week of Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the 11th Husar regiment of the British captured Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
In an attack in the east of Bardia, the British seized the chief engineer of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.
On June 28, Marshall Italo Balbo, the governor-general of Libya and alleged successor of Mussolini, was accidentally killed by shelling his own troops while he landed in Tobruk.
Modern martial arts is practiced on many levels, from university students to professional and Olympic competitions.
The sport is performed primarily as a duel by one fencer fighting with another.
Golf is a game where players use rackets to carry balls into holes.
During an ordinary round, eighteen holes are played, with players usually starting at the first hole of the course and stopping at the eighteenth.
The player who needs the fewest strokes or turns with the racket to complete the course wins.
The game is played on a lawn. The grass around the hole is cut shorter and called the green.
Perhaps the most common type of tourism is what most people associate with travel: recreational tourism.
This is the case when people go to a place for relaxation and pleasure that is very different from their normal everyday life.
Beaches, amusement parks and campsites are among the places most visited by leisure tourists.
If the goal of visiting a particular place is to learn its history and culture, then this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different attractions of a country or they can simply choose to focus on just one region.
The colonists had also called for reinforcement when they observed this activity.
The troops that reinforced the defensive positions included the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments with 200 men under the Colonels John Stark and James Reed (who later became both generals).
Stark's men stood along the fence at the north end of the position of the colonists.
When the ebb created a gap along the Mystic River in the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence northwards with a short stone wall that ended at a small beach on the edge of the water.
Gridley or Stark placed a stake about 100 feet (30 m) in front of the fence and ordered that no one should fire before the regular soldiers had walked past it.
The American plan relied on the implementation of coordinated attacks from three different directions.
General John Cadwalder carried out a distraction attack on the British garrison in Bordentown to block any further troops.
General James Ewing would lead 700 militias across the river at Trenton Ferry, seizing the bridge over Assunpink Creek and preventing all enemy troops from escaping.
The main attack force of 2,400 men was to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and then split into two groups, one under Greene and one under Sullivan, to launch an attack before dawn.
Due to the change from a quarter mile to a half mile race, the pace is far less important and endurance is an absolute necessity.
Of course, a first-class 800m runner running under two minutes must be fast, but in any case endurance must be trained.
A bit of cross-country skiing in winter combined with a training of the upper body in the sports hall is the best preparation for the running season.
Good nutrition alone does not guarantee top performance, but it significantly improves the overall well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, effective drinking habits, and understanding the different aspects of taking supplements can help athletes improve their performance and increase their enjoyment of sports.
Mid-range running is a relatively inexpensive sport; however, there are many misconceptions about the few equipment items you need for it.
The products can be purchased as needed, but most will have little or no real impact on performance.
Athletes may feel that they prefer a product, even if it offers no real benefits.
The atom can be regarded as one of the fundamental building blocks of all matter.
It is a very complex unit that, according to a simplified drilling model, consists of a central core orbited by electrons, similar to the Sun of the planets – see Figure 1.1.
The atomic nucleus consists of two particles – neutrons and protons.
Protons have a positive electrical charge, while neutrons have no charge. The electrons have a negative electrical charge.
To check the opera, you first need to get an overview of the venue to guarantee your safety.
You need to pay attention to the position of the victim as you approach him, as well as any automatic warning signs.
If you hurt yourself while trying to help, you only make things worse.
The study found that depression, anxiety, and disaster thinking in witch-shot patients have an impact on the connection between pain and activity restriction.
Only the effects of catastrophization, not depression and anxiety, were a prerequisite for regular weekly structured sessions with physical activity.
Those who participated in regular activities needed more support in terms of negative pain perception when it came to distinguishing chronic pain and discomfort from normal physical exercise.
Vision, that is, the ability to see, depends on the sensory organs of the visual system or the eyes.
Eyes can be constructed in many ways, the complexity of which differs from the requirements of the life form.
The different designs have different capabilities, are receptive to different wavelengths and have different visual acuity. They also require different types of processing of the recorded material for a meaningful impression, and the number of eyes associated with the respective design type, which is necessary for optimal functioning, is different.
A population is the accumulation of organisms of a particular species within a particular geographical area.
If all individuals of a population are similar in relation to a particular phenotypic characteristic, then they are called monomorphic.
If the individuals have different variations of a particular property, they are polymorphic.
Ant peoples also march and nest in different phases.
In the nomadic phase, wandering ants march at night and rest during the day.
The colony begins a nomadic phase when the available food has decreased. During this phase, the colony builds temporary nests, which are changed daily.
Each of these nomadic moves or marches lasts about 17 days.
"What is a cell? The word cell comes from the Latin word "cella", which means "small space", and it was first coined by a microscopic observer who observed the structure of cork."
The cell is the basic unit of all living beings and all organisms consist of one or more cells.
Cells are considered so fundamental and crucial in the exploration of life that they are often referred to as building blocks of life.
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body to keep blood flow moving unhindered.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly throughout the body to protect it from a potential threat.
Tornadoes hit a rather small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy anything that stands in their way.
Tornadoes uproot trees, tear boards of buildings, and throw cars through the air. The strongest 2 percent of tornadoes last more than three hours.
These monster storms have winds reaching speeds of up to 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 MPH).
People have been producing and using magnifying lenses for thousands of years.
However, the first true telescopes were built in Europe in the late 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects appear both closer and larger.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us and it is in the nature of cooperation that there is more and more to gain with selfish behavior as long as the majority benefits.
It remains to be hoped that most people realize that their long-term best option is to work with others.
Many people dream of the day when people can travel to other stars and explore other worlds. Some people worry about what is out there. Some believe that aliens or other life forms might exist on other planets.
But if this ever happens, it will take a very long time until then. The stars are scattered so far that even between "neighbor stars" there are trillions of kilometers.
Perhaps one day your great-grandchildren will stand at the top of an alien world and wonder who their ancestors were?
Animals consist of numerous cells. They eat things and digest them inside them. Most animals can move.
Only the animals have a brain (even if not all animals have one; for example, jellyfish do not have one).
Animals can be found all over the world. They crawl through the ground, swim in the oceans and fly in the air.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
Cell comes from the Latin word cella, which means small space.
If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see that they are made of smaller squares or balls.
Robert Hooke, a biologist from England, discovered small squares in the cork under a microscope.
They looked like spaces, he was the first person to observe dead cells.
Elements and connections can pass from one state to another and not change.
Nitrogen as a gas still has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser, but the molecules are the same.
The compound water consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
It has the same molecular structure, whether it is gaseous, liquid or solid.
Although its aggregate state may change, the chemical state remains the same.
Time is something that surrounds us everywhere and affects everything we do, yet is hard to understand.
Time has been explored for thousands of years by religious, philosophical and scientific thinkers.
We experience time as a sequence of events that run from the future through the present to the past.
Time is also the way we compare the duration (length) of events.
One can mark the passing of time itself by observing the repetition of a cyclic event. A cyclic event is something that happens regularly.
Computers are used today to manipulate images and videos.
Demanding animations can be constructed on the computer and are increasingly used in television and movies.
Music is often recorded with the help of sophisticated computers to process sounds and mix together.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was long thought that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maoris, who hunted giant birds called Moa.
The theory then led to the idea that the Maoris emigrated from Polynesia with a large fleet, taking away the Moriori from New Zealand and thus establishing a society based on agriculture.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori were a group of Maori from the mainland who migrated from New Zealand to the Chatham Islands and developed their own peaceful culture there.
There was another tribe in the Chatham Islands, the Maori who emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, there were some snipers and in the end the Moriori were destroyed.
Individuals who have been involved for several decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions, while difficulties and even failures were sincerely appreciated.
By listening to individuals who have shared their personal, family, and organizational stories, we have gained valuable insights into the past and into some personalities who have influenced the organization’s culture for good and bad.
Understanding one’s own history does not require an understanding of the culture, but at least it helps people to get a sense of where they are in the history of the organization.
As they evaluate the successes and notice the failures, individuals and all participants as a whole internalize the values, mission and driving forces of the organization more strongly.
In this case, the memory of previous cases of entrepreneurial behavior and the resulting successes helped people to be open to change and a new orientation of the parish.
Success stories like these reduced the fear of change and at the same time generated a positive attitude towards upcoming changes.
Converged thought patterns are problem-solving methods that bring together different ideas or areas to find a solution.
In this way of thinking, the focus is on speed, logic and accuracy, including the identification of facts, the re-application of existing techniques, the collection of information.
The most important factor of this attitude is this: there is only one correct answer. One thinks of only two possible answers, namely right or wrong.
This type of thinking is associated with certain scientific or standard procedures.
People with this mindset think logical, can memorize patterns, solve problems and work on scientific tests.
People are by far the most gifted way of reading other people’s thoughts.
This means that we are able to correctly assess what other people perceive, plan, think, know or want to do.
In addition to these abilities, it is crucial to understand the intentions of others. It allows us to clear out possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone smashing a car window, you’d probably assume they’re trying to steal a stranger’s car.
He would have to be judged differently if he had lost his car keys and it had been his own car that he tried to break into.
The MR is based on a physical phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (KMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (Harvard University).
In this resonance, the magnetic field and radio waves cause atoms to give tiny radio signals of themselves.
In 1970, the physician and researcher Raymond Damadian discovered the basis for the use of magnetic resonance imaging as an aid for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the world’s first patent in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first "whole body" MRI scanner, which he called the "invincible."
Asynchronous communication gives time for reflection and the reaction to others.
It allows students to work at their own speed and control the pace in dealing with the teaching content.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints and the possibility to work at flexible times. (Bremer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to have access to information at any time.
Students can also ask lecturers questions at any time of the day and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next personal meeting.
The postmodern approach of learning offers the freedom of the absolute. There is not only a good way to learn.
In fact, there is no good thing to learn. The learning takes place in the experience between the learner and the knowledge offered.
Our current experience with the many TV shows that focus on do-it-yourself approaches, information sharing and learning underlines this observation.
So many of us get caught watching a TV show that tells us about a process or experience, although we will never share it or apply that knowledge.
We will never overtake a car, build a fountain in our backyard, travel to Peru to investigate ancient ruins, or remodel our neighbor’s house.
Thanks to underwater fibre optic cable connections to Europe and broadband satellites, Greenland is well connected and 93% of the population has internet access.
Your hotel or hosts (if you are staying in an inn or a private apartment) probably have Wi-Fi or a PC connected to the Internet, and all settlements have an Internet café or a place with publicly accessible Wi-Fi.
“As already mentioned, while the word ‘Eskimo’ is still acceptable in the United States, it is considered degrading by many Arctic peoples outside the United States, especially in Canada.”
You may hear this word among the indigenous people of Greenland, but foreigners should avoid it.
The indigenous people of Greenland call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq in Greenland (many Kalaallits), i.e. Greenlanders.
Crime and displeasure towards foreigners in general are virtually unknown in Greenland, and even in the cities there are no "problem areas".
Cold weather is perhaps the only real danger that the unprepared could face.
If you are visiting Greenland in a cold season (because it gets colder the farther north you travel), it is essential to bring clothes that are warm enough.
The very long summer days can lead to insufficient sleep and associated health problems.
During the summer, also pay attention to the Nordic mosquitoes. Even if they do not transmit diseases, they are very annoying.
Although San Francisco’s economy is associated with the fact that the city is a world-class tourist attraction, it is nevertheless diversified.
The largest employment areas are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Her frequent portrayal in music, films, literature and pop culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known around the world.
San Francisco has built a comprehensive tourist infrastructure with numerous hotels, restaurants and first-class convention facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the nation’s best places for other Asian cuisine: Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
A trip to Walt Disney World is a great pilgrimage for many American families.
The "typical" visit includes the flight to Orlando International Airport, then the bus ride to a Disney hotel on site, then a week-long stay there without leaving the Disney site, and then the return trip.
There are countless variations possible, but this is what most people mean when they talk about a “travel to Disney World.”
Many tickets sold online via auction sites such as eBay or Craigslist are park-hopper tickets that have already been used for several days.
Although this is often handled this way, it is forbidden by Disney: the tickets are not transferable.
To camp below the edge of the Grand Canyon, you need a permit for the hinterland.
Licenses are limited to protect the canyon and are available from the first of the month, four months before the start of the month.
Thus, an approval for the hinterland is available on 1 January for any start date in May.
The space for the most popular areas, such as the Bright Angel Campground next to the Phantom Ranch, is usually filled by those requests received on the first day when reservations are possible for them.
There is a limited number of permits that are reserved for occasional requests and are awarded according to the principle "Who comes first, grinds first".
Getting into southern Africa by car is an amazing way to see all the beauty of the region and get to places off the beaten track.
This can be done with careful planning in a normal car. However, it is strongly recommended a four-wheel drive, as many places can only be reached with four-wheel drive and high wheelbase.
When planning, remember that while the South of Africa is stable, the neighboring countries are not always stable.
Requirements and costs for a visa vary with each country and depend on the country you are from.
Each country also has specific laws dictating which items must be in the car for emergencies.
Victoria Falls is a city in the western part of Zimbabwe, on the other side of the border of Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is right next to the waterfalls and they are the main attraction, but this popular tourist destination offers both adventurers and tourists, numerous opportunities for a longer stay.
In the rainy season (November to March), the amount of water will be higher and the cases will be more dramatic.
You can firmly assume that you will get wet as you cross the bridge or take advantage of the winding paths that lead along the waterfalls.
On the other hand, precisely because of the high volume of water, your view of the actual waterfall is obscured – by the whole water!
The tomb of Tutankhamun (KV62). KV62 is probably the most famous tomb in the valley. The tomb of the young king was discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter in almost intact condition.
However, compared to most other royal tombs, the tomb of Tutankhamen is hardly worth a visit, as it is much smaller and has few decorations.
Anyone interested in seeing evidence of the damage inflicted on the mummy in the attempts to take it out of the coffin will be disappointed, as only the head and shoulders are visible.
The fabulous riches of the tomb are no longer in it, but were brought to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Visitors who have limited time should spend it elsewhere.
Phnom Krom, 12 km southwest of Siem Reap, was built at the end of the 9th century during the reign of King Yasovarman.
The dark atmosphere of the temple and the view over the Tonle sap lake are worth climbing the hill.
A visit to the attraction can be conveniently connected with a boat trip on the lake.
Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple, so don’t forget to take your passport with you when you travel to Tonle Sap.
Jerusalem is Israel’s capital and largest city, but most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize the city as Israel’s capital.
The ancient city on the hills of Judea has a fascinating history that spans thousands of years.
The city is considered sacred in the three monotheistic religions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam – and serves as a spiritual, religious and cultural center.
Given the religious significance of the city and especially due to the many sights within the old town, Jerusalem is one of Israel’s most important tourist destinations.
Jerusalem offers many historical, archaeological and cultural sites in addition to dynamic and bustling shopping malls, cafes and restaurants.
Ecuador requires that Cuban citizens receive an invitation letter before entering Ecuador via international airports or border crossing points.
This letter must be declared legal by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet certain requirements.
These requirements are designed to ensure a regulated flow of migration between the two countries.
Cuban citizens who hold a U.S. Green Card should seek an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond the period of your trip. A return or onward flight ticket is required to prove the length of your stay.
Tours are cheaper for larger groups. If you are traveling alone or just with a friend or friend, then you should team up with others and try to start a group of four to six people to get a cheaper rate for the individual.
But you shouldn’t worry about that, because tourists are often combined to get the vehicles full.
This seems to be more of a trick to make people think they have to pay more.
High above the northern edge of Machu Picchu towers this steep mountain, which often represents the backdrop of many photos of the ruins.
From below it looks a bit daunting and it’s a steep and difficult climb, but most reasonably fit individuals should be able to cope with it in about 45 minutes.
Most of the path is covered with stone steps, and in the steeper sections steel ropes form a supporting railing.
However, count on being out of breath and be careful in the steeper sections, especially when it’s wet, as it can quickly become dangerous there.
Near the summit is a tiny cave to cross, which is quite low and very narrow.
The sights and wildlife of the Galapagos Islands are best visited by boat, as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
More than 60 cruise ships are in the waters around the Galapagos Islands – the size of which can range from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place long in advance (as the boats are usually full during high season).
Make sure you book through an intermediary specialized in the Galapagos Islands who knows a wide range of ships.
This way you can make sure that the ship is best suited to your specific wishes and/or limitations.
Before the Spanish reached Chile in the 16th century, the north of the country was under the rule of the Incas, while the middle and south of the country were inhabited by the native Araucans.
The Mapuche were also one of the last independent indigenous groups in America that were not fully absorbed into Spanish-speaking rule until the independence of Chile.
Although Chile declared its independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic Wars, through which Spain did not have a functioning central government for several years), the final victory could not be won until 1818.
The Dominican Republic is a country in the Caribbean that includes the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, which it shares with Haiti.
In addition to white sandy beaches and mountain landscapes, the country is also home to the oldest European city in America, which now belongs to Santo Domingo.
The island was originally inhabited by the Tainos and Caribbean, and the Caribbean spoke Arawak and arrived there about 10,000 years BC.
Within a few years of the arrival of the European explorers, the population of the Taino had experienced a significant decline due to the Spanish conquistadors.
According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias), the Spanish conquistadors killed about 100,000 Tainos between 1492 and 1498.
This complex was built as an atrium for a 17th-century monastery, the only building of which is the Templo de San Diego.
Now it serves as a central place, where numerous events take place during the day and night.
There are numerous restaurants around the garden, where in the afternoons and evenings often free concerts are held in the central pavilion.
Callejon del Beso (Kussgasse). Two balconies, which are only 69 cm away, are the place of an old love story.
For some small money, a few children will tell you about the story.
Bowen Island is a popular day or weekend getaway with kayaking, hiking, shops, restaurants and much more.
This authentic community is located in Howe Sound near Vancouver and is easily accessible with regular water taxis departing from Granville Island in downtown Vancouver.
For those who like to be active outdoors, a hike up to the sea-to-sky corridor is essential.
Whistler (1.5 hours drive from Vancouver) is expensive but well known due to the 2010 Winter Olympics.
Enjoy winter on some of North America’s top ski resorts, and during the summer you should try real mountain biking.
Permits must be ordered in advance. You need a permit to stay in La Sirena.
Sirena is the only ranger station that offers not only tents but also overnight stays in the dormitory and hot meals. La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos only offer camping without meals.
It is possible to get a parking license directly at the ranger station in Puerto Jiménez, but they do not accept credit cards
The park administration (MINAE) will issue permits for the park no earlier than one month before the scheduled arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of $30 or $10 for day passes. Details can be found on their Corcovado page.
The Cook Islands are an island state freely associated with New Zealand, and they are located in Polynesia in the middle of the South Pacific.
It is an archipelago of 15 islands spreading over 2.2 million square kilometers of ocean area.
With the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as "Hawaii Down Under".
Although smaller, it reminds some older visitors of Hawaii before it became a state without all the major tourist hotels and other developments.
The Cook Islands do not have any cities, but consist of 15 different islands, the most important being Rarotonga and Aitutaki.
In developed countries today, the offer of luxury guest houses has been raised to a kind of art form.
At the top of the scale, the B&Bs naturally compete for two main points: beds and breakfast.
Consequently, among the best of these accommodations, you can find the most opulent bedding, possibly a handmade duvet or an antique duvet frame.
At breakfast there may be seasonal delicacies from the region or the special dish of the host.
The frame can be a historic old building with an ancient furnishing, a beautifully prepared terrain and a swimming pool.
Getting into your own car and embarking on a long journey has an immanent appeal due to its simplicity.
Unlike larger vehicles, you are probably already familiar with driving your car and know its limitations.
Setting up a tent on a private property or in any large city can quickly lead to undesirable reactions.
In short, using your own car is a great option for a road trip, but not for camping.
Camping with a car is a possibility, provided you have a spacious minivan, an SUV, a sedan or a combination car with folding seats.
The heritage of some hotels dates back to the golden age of steam railways and ocean liners, the period before the Second World War, the 19th or early 20th century.
In these hotels, the rich and famous used to spend the night enjoying good food and nightlife.
The antique facilities, the absence of modern conveniences and a certain elegant ageing also characterize their character.
Although they are usually privately owned, they sometimes house heads of state and other dignitaries visiting.
Very wealthy travelers could opt for an air travel around the world, alternating with visits to many of these hotels.
A so-called Hospitality Exchange Network is the organization that connects travelers in the cities they visit with locals.
Joining such a network usually only requires filling out an online form; although some networks offer or require additional checks.
A list of available accommodation is now available either in print or online, and sometimes includes recommendations and reports from other travellers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004 because computer programmer Casey Fenton had found a cheap flight to Iceland, but no place to stay.
He sent emails to students of the local university and received an overwhelming number of offers for free accommodation.
Hostels are primarily aimed at young people – a typical guest is in his twenties – but you can often find older travelers there.
Families with children are a rare sight, but some hostels allow their accommodation in private rooms.
The city of Beijing in China will host the 2022 Winter Olympics, making it the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremony as well as the indoor ice cream events.
Further skiing events take place in the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.
Most temples have an annual festival between the end of November and mid-May, which varies depending on the annual calendar of the respective temple.
Most temple festivals are celebrated as part of the Temple Jubilee, the birthday of the Supreme Deity, or other important events related to the Temple.
The temple festivals in Kerala with regular moves of decorated elephants, temple orchestras and other festivities are very interesting to watch,
A world exhibition (often called World Expo or simply Expo) is a major international festival of arts and sciences.
Participating countries exhibit artistic and educational exhibits in national pavilions to present global concerns or the culture and history of the respective country.
International horticultural exhibitions are special events in which flower shows, botanical gardens and everything else related to plants are presented.
Although they may theoretically take place annually (as long as they are in different countries), this is different in practice.
These events usually last for three to six months and are held in places that cover at least 50 hectares.
Over the years, many different film formats have been used. The normal 35 mm film (negative with dimensions of 36 x 24 mm) is most common.
It can usually be retraced quite easily when you are out of it, and it has a resolution roughly equivalent to that of current digital SLR cameras.
Some medium format film cameras use a format of 6 x 6 cm, more precisely, a 56 x 56 mm negative.
This results in a nearly four times higher resolution than a 35 mm negative (3,136 mm2 compared to 864).
The wildlife is one of the most difficult motifs for a photographer. You need both luck and patience, experience and good equipment for this type of photography.
Wildlife photography is often accepted as given, but as with other photography, an image says more than a thousand words.
Wildlife photography often requires long telephoto lenses, although other lenses are required for subjects such as a bird's flock or a small creature.
Many exotic animals are hard to spot and in some parks there are regulations for photographing for commercial purposes.
Wildlife can be either shy or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or otherwise hostile.
There are over 5,000 different languages in the world, including more than twenty with 50 million or more speakers.
Written words are often easier to understand than spoken words, especially addresses where pronounced pronunciation is often difficult to understand.
Many entire nations speak fluent English, and in even more countries you can expect limited English skills, especially among younger people.
Imagine a person from Manchester, one from Boston, one from Jamaica and one from Sydney sitting together in a Toronto restaurant eating.
They enjoy each other’s stories from their home towns, presented in their distinctive accents and local jargons.
Buying food at the supermarket is usually the cheapest way to get full, but without cooking facilities, the choice is limited to ready-made dishes.
Supermarkets are receiving an increasing variety of ready-to-eat dishes, some even offering microwaves and other methods of warming up the food.
In some countries or store types, there is at least one local restaurant that is often more casual and affordable.
Make copies of your policy and your insurer’s contact details and carry them with you.
For consultations/authorizations and application, you must provide the insurer’s e-mail address and international telephone numbers.
Keep another copy in your baggage and online (e-mail to yourself with attachment or stored in the “Cloud”).
If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, create a copy in memory or on hard drive (which is available without the internet).
Also provide copies of insurance/contact details to fellow travelers and relatives or friends at home who are willing to help.
Elves are not inherently aggressive, but defend themselves when they perceive a threat.
People who don’t see the moose as a possible threat can get too close to it and endanger themselves.
Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation. Alcohol affects everyone differently and it is very important to know your own limit.
The potential long-term health problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption may include liver damage and even blindness and death. The potential danger is increased by the consumption of illegally produced alcohol.
Illegal spirits can contain various hazardous impurities, including methanol, which can lead to blindness or death even in small doses.
Glasses can be cheaper in other countries, especially in low-income countries where labor costs are lower.
Consider taking an eye exam in your home country, especially if it is covered by insurance, and then redeeming the prescription in another country.
High-quality brand versions available in such areas can have two problems - some may be counterfeits, the real ones imported may be more expensive than in their own country.
Coffee is one of the most traded goods in the world and you can probably find many different varieties in your home region.
Still, there are many different ways to drink coffee around the world that you should experience.
Canyoning (also called canyons) is about getting to the bottom of a canyon that is either dry or full of water.
Elements of canyoning are swimming, climbing and jumping – but it has relatively low demands on training and physical fitness for beginners (for example, compared to rock climbing, sports diving and alpine skiing).
Hiking is an outdoor activity that consists of walking in nature, often on hiking trails.
Day hikes include distances from less than a mile to longer distances that can be covered in a single day.
It doesn’t take much preparation for a day hike on a simple route and anyone who is reasonably fit can enjoy it.
Families with young children may need more preparations, but an outdoor day is also easy to do with babies and preschoolers.
There are almost 200 running tour organizations worldwide. Most of them work independently.
Go Running Tours, the successor to Global Running Tours, connects dozens of sightseeing providers on four continents.
With roots in Barcelona’s Running Tours Barcelona and Copenhagen’s Running Copenhagen, it quickly grew through Running Tours Prague in Prague and more.
There are many things to consider before and during a trip.
Don’t expect things to be just like “at home” when traveling; manners, laws, food, traffic, accommodations, standards, spakes, and so on will be to some extent different from where you live.
This is something you should always keep in mind to avoid disappointment or even dislike of local practices.
Travel agencies have been around since the 19th century. A travel advisor is usually a good choice for travel that goes beyond the traveler’s previous experience in terms of nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies are willing to take on most regular bookings, many representatives specialize in specific types of travel, price ranges, or destinations.
It may make more sense to use a travel advisor who often books similar trips to yours.
Take a look at the travels that the travel agent advertises on the website or in a shop window.
If you want to see the world inexpensively, because of your lifestyle, or as a challenge, there are some ways to do so.
You can essentially be divided into two categories: either work while you travel or try to reduce your expenses. This article focuses on the latter.
For those who are willing to forego comfort, time, and predictability in order to reduce spending almost to zero, see Traveling on a minimal budget.
The advice presupposes that travelers do not steal, commit breaches of peace, engage in black market activities, beg or otherwise exploit other people for their own benefit.
An immigration checkpoint is usually the first stop when you get out of an airplane, ship, or other vehicle.
Some cross-border trains carry out checks on the moving train and you should have a valid ID when boarding one of these trains.
In night trains, the passports can be collected by the shepherd so that your sleep is not interrupted.
Registration is another requirement in the visa process. In some countries, you must report your presence and residence address to the local authorities.
This means, for example, filling out a form with the local police or becoming present with the immigration authority.
In many countries with such a law, local hotels take care of registration (do not forget to ask for it).
If necessary, only travelers who do not live in tourist accommodation must register. However, this makes the law much more unclear, so you should inform yourself before starting the trip.
The architecture is concerned with the design and construction of buildings. The architecture of a place is often a tourist attraction in itself.
Many buildings are very beautiful to look at and the view from a tall building or from a skillfully positioned window can turn out to be beautiful.
Architecture largely overlaps with other areas of expertise, including urban planning, construction, decorative art, spatial design and landscape design.
Considering how remote many of the Pueblos are, you won’t find any significant nightlife if you don’t travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe.
However, almost all of the casinos listed above serve drinks and some of them invite renowned entertainers (mainly the large casinos in the immediate vicinity of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
Caution: The small-town pubs in this area are not always suitable for guests from outside.
On the one hand, Northern New Mexico has significant problems with driving under the influence of alcohol, and in the vicinity of small-town bars, the concentration of drunk drivers is particularly high.
Unwanted wall paintings or lubrications are known as graffiti.
Although it is anything but a modern phenomenon, most people probably associate it with adolescents who destroy public and private property with spray paint.
"Nowadays, however, there are established graffiti artists, graffiti events, and 'legal' walls. In this context, graffiti paintings are more common than unreadable scribbles."
Boomerang throwing is a popular skill that many tourists want to learn.
If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang back to your hand, make sure you have a suitable boomerang.
Most boomerangs that are available in Australia don’t actually return. Beginners should try not to throw in windy weather if possible.
A hungi dish is cooked in a hot hole in the ground.
The pit is heated with hot stones from a fire or in some places by geothermal heat, where the soil is naturally hot.
Hangi is often used to prepare a traditionally fried dinner.
Several locations in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi, while other hangi can be tasted in Christchurch, Wellington and elsewhere.
MetroRail has two classes of commuter trains in and around Cape Town: MetroPlus (also referred to as the first class) and Metro (called the third class).
MetroPlus is more comfortable and less crowded, but a bit more expensive – although still cheaper than normal metro tickets in Europe.
Each train has both MetroPlus and MetroWagens. The MetroPlus cars are always at the end that is Cape Town's closest.
Carry for others – Never lose sight of your luggage, especially if you cross international borders.
You could be used as a drug messenger without knowing it, which brings you a lot of trouble.
This also includes waiting in the queue, as drug tracking dogs could be used at any time and without notice.
In some countries, even for first-time offenses, there are draconian penalties, which may include prison sentences of over 10 years or the death penalty.
Unattended bags are a target for thieves and can also attract the attention of authorities who fear bomb threats.
At home, you are likely to be immune to local germs because you are constantly exposed to them.
However, in other parts of the world, where bacterial fauna is new to you, you will be much more likely to encounter problems.
In warmer climates, bacteria also grow faster and survive longer outside the body.
Hence the scourges of Delhi Belly, the pharaoh's curse, Montezuma's revenge and her many friends.
Like breathing problems in cold climates, intestinal problems are quite widespread in hot climates, and in most cases they are very annoying, but rather harmless.
When you first travel to a developing country – or a new part of the world – you should not underestimate how strong the culture shock can be.
Many stable, capable travelers have already been overwhelmed by the differentiation of travel in developing countries, where the many small cultural differences can quickly add up.
Especially in the first few days, you should consider using hotels, food and services with Western character and quality to facilitate acclimatization.
Sleep in areas where you don’t know the local wildlife, not on a mattress or mat on the floor.
If you are camping outdoors, you should bring a folding bed or hammock to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions, etc.
Fill your home with a delicious morning coffee and some relaxing chamomile tea in the evening.
If you’re on vacation at home, you’ll have the time to let it go well and invest a few more minutes to brew something special.
If you want a little more adventure, take the chance to make or mix smoothies more juicy:
You may find a simple drink that you can prepare for breakfast when you return to your daily routine.
If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, go to bars or pubs in neighborhoods you don’t visit often.
For those who know little about medical jargon: the terms infectious and contagious have different meanings.
An infectious disease is a disease caused by a pathogen, such as a virus, bacterium, fungus, or other parasites.
A contagious disease is a disease that is easily transmitted when you are in the vicinity of an infected person.
Many governments require incoming visitors or outgoing residents in their countries to be vaccinated against a number of diseases.
These requirements often depend on which countries a holidaymaker has already visited or which he wants to visit.
One of the strengths of Charlotte (North Carolina) is that there is a wealth of high-quality offers for families.
Residents from other areas often state family-friendliness as the main reason for their move, and visitors with children feel very comfortable in the city.
Over the last 20 years, the selection of child-friendly options in Uptown Charlotte has grown exponentially.
Taxis are usually not used by families in Charlotte, although they can be useful in certain circumstances.
There is an additional fee for more than 2 passengers, which may make this choice more expensive than necessary.
Antarctica, which surrounds the South Pole, is the coldest place on Earth.
Tourist visits are expensive, require physical fitness, can only take place in the summer (Nov-Feb) and are largely limited to the peninsula, the islands and the Ross Sea.
A few thousand employees live here in about four dozen bases during the summer, mainly in these areas; a small number remain over the winter.
The interior of Antarctica is a secluded plateau covered with 2-3 km of ice.
Occasional specialized flight tours lead inland, to mountaineering or to the pole, where there is a large research station.
The South Pole Traverse (also known as Highway) is a 1600 km road from McMurdo station on the Ross Sea to the Pole.
The road surface is covered with snow. The columns are filled with snow and marked with flags. The road can only be driven by special tractors that pull sledges with fuel and supplies.
These are not very maneuverable, so the road around the Transantarctic Mountains has to make a wide arc to get to the plateau.
The most common cause of accidents in winter are slippery roads, walkways (tramps) and above all steps.
At least you need shoes with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, even some winter boots are insufficient.
The profile should be deep enough, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material soft enough even at low temperatures.
Some boots have studs and for slippery conditions there is additional equipment with studs for the heels or heels and soles that are suitable for most shoes and boots.
The heels should be low and wide. Sand, gravel or salt (calcium chloride) are often scattered on roads or pathways to improve soil adhesion.
Avalanches are not an anomaly; steep slopes can only hold a certain amount of snow and the excess amount comes down as avalanches.
The problem is that the snow sticks, so it takes a trigger for the snow to come down. A little snow falling down can be the triggering event for the rest.
Sometimes the original trigger is the sun that warms the snow, sometimes it is further snowfall, sometimes other natural events, often a human being.
A tornado is a swirling column of air with very low pressure, which allows the surrounding air to suck in and ascend.
They generate strong winds (often 100-200 miles/hour) and can lift and swirl heavy objects into the air.
They start as funnels that sink from thunderstorm clouds and become “tornadoes” when they touch the ground.
Personal VPN providers (virtual private network) are an excellent way to bypass both political censorship and commercial IP geofilters.
They are superior to web proxies for various reasons: they redirect all internet traffic, not just http.
Usually, they offer higher bandwidths and better performance quality. They are encrypted and therefore more difficult to spy on.
The media companies regularly lie about the intent behind it, claiming that it serves to “prevent piracy.”
Rather, the regional code has no effect on the pirated copy. The bit-by-bit copy of a CD runs without problems on all devices on which the original runs.
The real purpose is to give these companies more control over their markets; it’s all about profit.
Since the calls are routed over the internet, you do not need to use a telephone company located at your place of residence or destination.
It is also not required that you receive a local number from the community you live in. You can get an Internet connection via satellite in the wilderness of Chicken in Alaska and select a number that pretends to be in sunny Arizona.
In many cases, you have to buy a global number separately that you can call on via the public telephone network. Where the number comes from makes a difference to the people you call.
Real-time text translation apps – apps that are capable of automatically translating entire sections of a text from one language to another.
Some of the applications in this category can even translate foreign-language texts to signs or other objects in the real world when the user directs the smartphone to these objects.
Translation machines have dramatically improved your performance and now often provide more or less accurate translations (and less caudal), but caution is needed, as they may still misunderstand everything.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translate, which allows offline translation after downloading the data of the desired language.
Using GPS navigation apps on your smartphone is probably the easiest and most practical way to find your way outside your home country.
This can save money because you do not have to buy new maps for a navigation device or a standalone navigation device or rent one from a rental car company.
Your performance may be limited or unavailable if you do not have a data connection to your phone or if it is out of reach.
Each corner store is filled with a confusing selection of prepaid phone cards that can be used for coin phones or regular phones.
While you can call anywhere with most cards, some only serve to provide favorable rates for certain groups of countries.
These services are often accessible via a free phone number, which can be called from most phones at no charge.
The rules for normal photography also apply to video recording, perhaps even more so.
If you’re not allowed to take a picture, you shouldn’t even think about taking a video of it.
If you are using a drone, you should check well in advance what you are allowed to film and what permits or additional licenses are required.
Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd is almost always a bad idea, even if it’s not illegal in their area.
Nowadays, air travel is rarely booked directly with the airline without prior search and price comparisons.
Sometimes the same flight can have extremely different prices on different booking sites, so it pays to compare search results before booking and also check the airline's website itself.
Even if you don’t need a visa for short visits to certain countries as a tourist or for business, entry as an international student usually requires a longer stay than if you were to travel only as an ordinary tourist.
In general, a long-term stay in a foreign country requires the prior application of a visa.
Student visas generally have different requirements and application procedures than normal tourist or business visas.
For most countries, you will need a written offer from the institution you want to study at and proof that you have the means to keep yourself above water at least in your first year of study.
Find out about the individual requirements at the institution as well as at the immigration office of the country in which you want to study.
Unless you are a diplomat, when working abroad, you generally need to file your income tax return in the country where you reside.
Income tax is structured differently in different countries and tax rates and classes vary greatly from one country to another.
In some federally organized countries, such as the United States and Canada, income tax is levied both at the federal and local levels, so tax rates and groups may vary from region to region.
While there is usually no entry control on arrival in your home country or this is just a formality, customs control can be a nuisance.
Make sure you know what you can and can’t introduce and state everything that goes beyond the legal limits.
The easiest way to get an introduction to travel literature is to refine your skills on an established travel blog site.
Once you get used to formatting and editing online, you may also be able to create your own website later.
Volunteering while traveling is a great way to change, but it’s not just about giving.
Living in a foreign country and volunteering is a great way to get to know another culture, meet new people, learn about yourself, see things from a different perspective, and even learn new skills.
It can also be a good way to increase your budget to make a longer stay possible, as many volunteer services include food and lodging and some pay a low fee.
The Vikings used the Russian waterways to get to the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used today. Perhaps a special permit is required for use. Getting this is not always easy.
The White Sea-Baltic Sea waterway links the North Ocean with the Baltic Sea via Lake Onega, Lake Ladogase and Saint Petersburg, mostly via rivers and lakes.
Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga, so it is still possible to travel from the Caspian Sea through Russia.
Rest assured that everything will be pretty clear as soon as you reach the jetty. You will meet other boat trappers who will share their knowledge with you.
Basically, you will offer your help, walk around the docks, approach people cleaning their yachts, get in touch with sailors in the bar, etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible. After a while everyone knows you and you will get tips on which boat someone is looking for.
You should thoroughly select your frequent flyer airline in an alliance.
Even if you may think that you should instinctively take the airline you fly the most with, you should note that the benefits offered are often different. Frequent flyer points could be awarded more generously with another airline on the same route.
Airlines such as Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines have significantly expanded their flights to Africa and offer low-cost flights to numerous major African cities compared to European airlines.
As of 2014, Turkish Airlines flies to 39 destinations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, consider what your total travel expenses to Africa look like compared to the cost of a world trip.
Do not forget to charge the extra costs for further visas, departure fees, land transport, etc. for all places outside of Africa.
If you want to completely circle the world in the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is very limited due to the lack of transoceanic routes.
No aviation alliance covers all three ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere (and SkyTeam does not offer any of these connections).
However, Star Alliance covers everything outside the eastern South Pacific from Santiage de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.
This flight is not the only option if you want to skip the South Pacific and the South American West Coast. (see below)
In 1994, the ethnic Armenian region of Karabakh in Azerbaijan waged war against the Azerbaijanis.
With Armenian support, a new republic was founded, but it does not officially recognize any established country – not even Armenia.
Diplomatic disputes over the region continue to cloud relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
The Grachtengordel (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is the famous 17th-century district that encompasses the city centre of Amsterdam.
The entire district has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its unique cultural and historical value and its real estate values are among the highest in the country.
Cinque Terre, meaning as much as Five Countries, includes the five small coastal villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso in the Italian region of Liguria.
They are on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
Over the centuries, up to the cliffs that lie directly above the sea, carefully terraces were built into the rough, sloping terrain.
Its charm also includes that there are no visible business buildings. The villages are connected by roads, trains and boats and no cars come in from outside.
The variants of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the variant spoken in France, but are similar enough to be understandable for both sides.
In particular, counting in French-speaking Belgium and Switzerland has some minor peculiarities that differ from French spoken in France, and also the pronunciation of some words differs a little.
Nonetheless, it can be assumed that all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss students at school have learned standard French and understand you, even if you use the normal French counting system.
In many parts of the world, Winken is a friendly gesture that signals a “hello.”
“However, in Malaysia, or at least among the Malays in rural areas, it means ‘come here’, similar to curving the index finger toward the body, a gesture used in some Western countries, and should only be used for this purpose.”
Similarly, a British traveler in Spain may misunderstand a waving to say goodbye where the palm faces the waving (and not the person who is waving) as a gesture to come back.
Auxiliary languages are artificial or constructed languages created with the aim of facilitating communication between peoples that would otherwise be difficult to communicate.
They differ from the so-called Linguae Francae, natural or organic languages, which for various reasons become predominant as a means of communication between speakers of other languages.
In the daytime heat, travelers can experience fata morgans that convey the illusion of water (or other things).
These can be dangerous if the traveler tracks the air mirroring and wastes valuable energy and his remaining water.
Even in the hottest deserts it can get extremely cold at night. Without warm clothing, hypothermia poses a real danger.
Especially in the summer they have to be careful of mosquitoes if they want to wander through the rainforest.
Even if you drive through the subtropical rainforest by car, a few seconds with open doors on board are enough to take mosquitoes into the car.
Bird flu, or rather avian influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
There are fewer than a thousand documented cases in humans, but some of them were fatal.
Most cases affected people working with poultry, but there is also a certain risk for birdwatchers.
Steil fjords and valleys that unexpectedly merge into a high, more or less flat plateau are typical of Norway.
These plateaus are often referred to as "vidde", which means a wider, open, treeless space, a limitless space.
In Rogaland and Agder they are usually called "hei", which means a treeless moor landscape, often covered with heather.
The glaciers are not stable, but flow down the mountain, creating cracks and cracks that can be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and ceilings of ice caves can collapse and cracks close.
On the edge of glaciers, huge blocks break down, fall down, and may jump or roll further away from the edge.
The tourist season for the hill stations usually peaks during the Indian summer.
However, in winter they have a different kind of beauty and magic. Numerous mountain stations have plenty of snow and activities such as skiing and snowboarding on offer.
Few airlines still offer death rates with a slight discount on a last-minute trip to a funeral.
The airlines that offer them include Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa for flights from the USA or Canada, as well as Westjet.
In any case, you must book by phone through the airline.
