Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A mad institution where young people are supposed to meet today.
A tomb chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being dug.
Farmers cultivate the former land of farmers.
Munich’s oldest official map promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps are not up-to-date.
Everyone knows this, who has had to get upset, because the car navigation instead of a bypass indicated a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the state government’s geoportal Bavaria, are anything but current – but that is precisely why they are very revealing.
Especially when compared to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury since the 19th century.
The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognizable.
More detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first surveying of Bavaria.
Its owner: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical recording of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even though the French troops finally departed with the Peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, it was today’s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian map.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued the project, founding the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like all others, can be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.
The comparison Former/Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated.
Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich district.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The Untersendling houses are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered floor pieces from the so-called "overtake", from which the property tax was derived.
Today, small plots no longer occupy farmers there - but small farmers of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Luften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße people were once imprisoned with delusions.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich County Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created.
From 1872 onwards, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Louis II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called madmen.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has been involved with the institution for an exhibition.
At first, there was room for 280 patients, and later it was expanded to 500 seats.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinik München-Ost has been located there, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth shelter with training facilities.
To the west lies the football field of TSV Munich Ost, east of residential houses from the 1980s.
In 2015, the Children's House "Casa Don Bosco" was erected in an architectural way based on the original building of the madhouse, which had been destroyed during the Second World War during bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as "Hauptplatz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change to the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allies ripped many holes into the city center in December 1944.
One big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business buildings and a burial chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preparatory work is being carried out and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line takes place.
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to come into force on August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents have recently occurred across the state and are noted here,” the group said in a statement.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as state law enforcement agencies disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have civil rights violations that happen to people.
They are being stopped because of their skin color, they are being beaten or killed,” said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such a frequency that we haven’t heard yet.”
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under questionable circumstances early in the year after he had no more gasoline while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showing that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
“The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be ready whether they bring bail money or let their relatives know they’re traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which ranks the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Meadow fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher willow fence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
CDU MPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have obtained an image on the spot.
At the right graveyard of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his farm, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, feeds 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, the "Black Forest Milk" is the alternativeless marketing route for the milk of his cows, Schwendemann says.
On the table of the holiday guests comes only regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the willow fence project as "elementarily important".
I can't profit on such steep lands.
The grassland area ensures a lot of work, many things have to be processed with the motor sense.
“We are struggling with the conditions and the topography,” Schwendemann said.
In 2003 he took over the parental business and manages it without chemical crop protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the willow fence project and is happy about the Leader funding".
At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be extended for a long time.
“The biggest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how to continue their operations,” the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced over the willow fence funding.
The open holding area is thus 40 hectares, which cannot be reforested until at least 2023.
Half of the total costs of 71,500 euros were financed by Leader, while a quarter were financed by the municipality of Fischerbach.
As a result, the farmers were left with 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women you can not."
For Peter Weiß, it was also clear: "Best food is produced here".
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows state funding for grazing fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor frame designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be manageable with tractors (inclination above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher willow fence project 2018, the application is currently underway by eight participants with 24 plots that want to build just under 16 kilometers of fence.
The open-keeping area is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.
Is nothing sacred anymore?
Now Trump’s White House takes over the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 in Firdos Square in Baghdad.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key ideologues, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta about the president’s proposals to drastically curb legal immigration.
To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
As Miller told Acosta, “I don’t want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are referring to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller is factually correct, but as he himself put it, it’s not really about history.
It’s about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: “Your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts.”
There has never been a time when the “miserable garbage” could be seen better on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural controversy: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who were committed to putting their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were doing a high-political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting, in a worn-out classical pictorial representation, the feminine embodiment of freedom.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame to the enveloped world: “Lady Liberty is moving ahead.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States.”
Quite unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize.
Their torch should not illuminate the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship framework will “make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "evolved something special in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we’re trying to understand it, and we’re going to continue it until we figure it out,” Black said.
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain by the team.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain’s speech was incredible,” Black says.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally was great."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it’s “incredible” that 16 Scots are in the British team.
Scotland's best total athletes so far at the World Cup were seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The mid-range runner Muir is leading this path and has set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.
Chris O’Hare, who runs 1,500 meters, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included victory in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on Team Lee McConnell was.
The team captain says she is "very proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also be part of the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it something very special for me," she added.
“Obviously I’m very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we have come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it’s really important to rely on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic stadium.
I’m getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Apply for a Public Office if you can’t tolerate electoral heating
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn’t long before the newspapers beat him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He complained about the criticism, of course.
But he did not silence his critics.
In 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb and dumb, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor’s staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with “Well, what?”
“It’s just Facebook,” many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and playfully debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the side of the governor – which is a public forum called official and from employees paid with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not profane.
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the comments section of The Post.
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same issue, then they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor’s staff called a “concentrated spam attack” would likely be called “pronunciation.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It’s much cleaner than in the past if you’d done the same thing that employees were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this matter fell last week in Virginia.
Loudoun County’s Chairman of the Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letterwriters responded to his leadership.
Even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers that defeated Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his position on Amity’s treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected from the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, which last year led next door at Archerfield Links to the finals before losing to Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we’re seeing it gaining fame with this event,” Rafferty said.
"Players will see this course at its best, it's in great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place up.
He is a keen supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It feels really special,” said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to the action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that added pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m glad how it went so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission is free of charge, the parking space costs €5 per car with one occupant and €10 per car with two or more occupants.

Less lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this subject from 1994.
At the time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths per year due to passive smoking in Germany.
The study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections prove to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "is somewhat timely", according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of home connections, the situation is more complicated than expected, as there is much hidden underground that is not mentioned in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a big problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the drivers in front of red traffic lights and gateways is already enormous," Heinze reports.
The road is closed and only buses are allowed to pass.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days were hard.
But fortunately, our friend Fritz Matt supplied us with cool mineral water,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai regency in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavy, and there are the soldiers here.
“No one dares walk around the village after 5 p.m.,” she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was incorporated in Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were supposed to vote by a public hand raise before the occupation forces.
An existing movement that pushed for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from doing so.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encompassing the eastern part of the island.
The journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated roofs that have been converted into various yellowish tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes, too.
“We weren’t used to wearing those clothes,” says Degei, pointing to her vivid, hand-woven turban, dark shirt, and light skirt.
“We used to have only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of wood resources.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuan people, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We Will Lose Everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities of the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of casualties as incidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia’s researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have strengthened as Papua’s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning canteens sell fried chicken and gadado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to keep up.
“Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura.
"It cost the native Papua - the mother-mother [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokovi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You said.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low just two months after Jokovi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was out singing Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifle pistons, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting arches and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters started throwing stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: “If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead,” according to an official document from TIME that was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot into my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
“It was crowded, many shots were fired,” he adds.
The native man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
“I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, carries only one name, the TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
Papuan police chief inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to “secure” her station because she was being attacked.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Papuan police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings did not come to Jakarta until the next day.
For three weeks, Jokovi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical misfortunes in Papua.
“I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it won’t happen again in the future,” he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to settle historical human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
“Most injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through,” he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has accused of “crimes against humanity,” which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody independence vote of 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim disbelief.
“I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress,” Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid to be arrested by the military, I’m afraid to be shot.”
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai’s neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Excited villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
“We were so panicked, we’re afraid there will be revenge,” says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to TIME.
“I hid in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the mobile brigade of the police to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been an turmoil for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by instigating sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as “a tragic, forgotten place.”
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: notes and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the task of the women, who can each process four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They keep the majority of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten notes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities between the native Papuan and the new migrants have increased since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or skills to run its own businesses competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps the world’s eyes away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s campaign promises to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
“There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia’s most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua: visa denial and a blacklist,” he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “different and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group’s allegations and told journalists in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, a democratic system is still in place, and there are free media, so it’s difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases.”
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and pressed him “We want freedom”, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuan say they are unlikely to vote for Jokovi again.
“Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings,” says Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papuan people, see their vote for Jokovi as a “guilt” that he must pay back.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they don’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Yacobus with a lowered head.
"What else can we do?"
Fires capture Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire hit one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-storey building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the skyscraper in just two years, which happens to be called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and the people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” one resident told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said the firefighting units quenched the fire at around 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working on providing housing for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage came from the cladding, exterior cladding for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe that the system of panels for isolation and disguise at London’s Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Next best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed with his major Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single on only two winning sets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long, but also therefore highly appreciated five-set classics are thus preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted in favour of the reform, so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work on improving the competitions.
Not even to the vote, after many objections, had already come the proposal to take the final in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: In the future, the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host the first round in the following year.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training pitches etc. will be facilitated and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. Travelers Puts Prohibited Items on Airplane, a Survey Finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while inadvertently carrying forbidden knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had discovered late that they had traveled mistakenly with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people – conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – also found that younger travelers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted to knowingly carrying items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they intentionally brought banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many intentionally did it.
It’s no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggling goods – knowingly or unknowingly – through security were the ones who flew the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of it.
So it’s no surprise that the largest amount of items confiscated by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA could see books as smuggling goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far underlined that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the increasingly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed for the first time another, less glamorous figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: those of cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Musk admits that 63,000 of the 518,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will reimburse the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) “reservation deposit” in full.
Currently there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand but production.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, all models combined are expected to be 500,000, in 2020, one million.
The demand for it is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
However, if there are major delays, the non-binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws because of delaying Obama era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is about a deadline that expired on October 1st for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid “interfering in local decisions or hampering economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma State Attorney prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of strict environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly switched to blocking or delaying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his turnaround in ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement set the date for implementation,” Pruitt said, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in judicial regulation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and authority that exists to us seriously.”
However, the EPA’s opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use its “authority to delay and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the regulations are “based on sound policies and the best information available.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA - according to our lawsuits - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
“It’s disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable move from the person in charge of protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration’s ideological crusade to target polluters and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: To mark the anniversary of the mountain church, a Serenade will be held at the old cemetery site in Tumlingen on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the Sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini says, “It’s a unique village gem.”
In 1267, the St. Hilariu Chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergische Urkundenbuch: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen with the Vogtei" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Marks of silver.
According to the text of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, besides the former parish church, there was also a stately court, to which the church or the patronage belonged and not vice versa.
There were also people living there.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement center of the village.
Ancient maps from around 1600 underpin this historical situation.
The patronage law originated from early medieval church law.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a pastor, remained the owner of the church and was able to inherit it.
This was accompanied by the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The largest of the two burst at Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell was first sounded in 1692, but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942.
During the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648), the windows were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
In order to prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf that still exists today remains as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Sharp Retirees" as successors to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite to the St. Hilariu Chapel for the sixth Serenade on Sunday, July 16.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Hartmut Romans is the concluding speaker.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
Entrance is from 3.30 p.m.
At the end of the Serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius facility, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim resists" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the district council.
The association "Boisheim resists" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, since at the time in Viersen only a wind turbine concentration zone existed at the city border to Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier by changing the land use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a form defect.
"Due to the lack of planning requirements, the issued approval notice is still illegal and therefore can be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, Chairman of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of affairs: The city council has once again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "At this point, the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
“The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week,” a spokesman said.
The circle takes it as an opportunity to reconsider the matter.
However, they are not expected to stop the process.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim resists".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11,400 households can be met - this corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-sen households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersens Stadtrat gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg County.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in horrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The national road was closed for hours.
According to the police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich travelled with her car in the context of the accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and merchants plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents to the city center for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should make customers aware of what offers the own city has to offer away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional providers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city centre are to invite you to "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
Thus, the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attraktive Downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "active day" for the fountain festival including an open-sale Sunday, talks with all tradesmen and hosts to get them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be re-opened or re-exploited.
These include spa guests and tourists.
But many locals also lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help invigorate the city centre - up to landlords, the operations of the entire city and clubs.
It was important to overcome the lethargy with a network, which had partly broadened, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, said that five Thuringian cities participated for the first time in Germany’s third “home shopping” day.
Besides Bad Langensalza these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities," said Streich.
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment with his buying behaviour.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
Other people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department on Wednesday (local time) was still an injured person in critical condition.
One person died when a part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was also rescued later.
The dead were school employees.
As a cause of accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls over payment of border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been released by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall, and reportedly said to him, "You can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidential campaign promising to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to have Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take over refugees emigrating to Australia would be “ridiculous,” “bad,” and “stupid,” and that the insistence on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a “depp” after he proposed a ban on relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr. Turnbull, “This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day.”
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Relaunch Racist Lynch Act as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and bumped toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles stepped out to block his way.
The leader of the mob – a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit – took a long pull on his cigar and looked through the windshield examining.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man screamed.
“Take him out of the car!”
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this horrible scene played on July 22 is just a re-enactment.
But when a snare is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience is sighing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been returning to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
“It’s really inconceivable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years – even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reentry.
“It’s a dirt spot on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want law enforcement, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A court doctor lays a bedclothe over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files received from NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching process.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for the Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm farmer Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight – allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcom’s wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she wore wasn’t from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they moved away from the prison and approached Moore’s Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
“It turns out it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders,” an FBI report concluded.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence, and covered up the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks puts it even more concisely.
“It was a suffrage massacre,” he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you.'"
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual remake of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch Murders.
Her portrayal is vivid, poignant, and rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about lynching because we’re then confronted with its ugliness in all of us,” she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I’ve been through.”
The rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors – a dozen whites and the rest blacks – rushed into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-recorded overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom screaming at Hester and teasing him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get out of my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said a --- he."
“Yes,” one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that is where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a grief dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's mourning praise speech "Strange Fruit".
Your voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has arrived from Ithaca, New York, to watch the performance, many just come down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorseys tombs.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now that you are standing in the same country where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies, and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," a little boy murmured, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his fellow players and then cries in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through with him.
“It’s okay,” whispered one of the women.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excited about the re-enactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling the performance left behind.
“It’s hard to hear those horrible words and actions... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you,” she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on,” she added, “today it’s just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone holds Brooks's court at his table, he eats and reminds of civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
“The re-enactment is in a way inspiring because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history are condemned to repeat it.”
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful and frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The swivel stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) optionally shows a shabby street corner with a wall rest and a Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels reminiscent of Castorf's guiding motif - money, power and greed - that runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as they did in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drags a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
The scene is brutal when he strikes Siegfried.
Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe it later.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in a stormy way, who humbles himself and bows his hands to the Merkel rude.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat again in casual casual casual clothing.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
Had he had to give a valid whistle concert in 2013, there was a great jubilation five years later, in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Headwoman Katharina Wagner will be happy about this.
“You notice that the audience has grown together with the ‘ring’ in some way,” she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of his point of view.
I'm making a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
During their year of volunteering, they work in several places.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked at school all day.
What are your experiences with it?
Q: It’s a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, a late volunteer.
Why is that?
QUESTION: I did high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let’s say, successfully aborted.
I realized it was wrong for me and I wanted to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, as there is an insight, as you can see how it is on the ground, in the focal point maybe also, really.
And was it?
QUANTITY: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in social sciences in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training at the Herne Youth Office and study at the Hamm University of Applied Sciences.
Isn’t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
For me it was very varied.
I was also partially in the OGS, i.e. in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works.
Unlike in civil engineering?
QUANTITY: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people on your mind, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren't afraid of touch?
Q: I'm not the guy for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
There are times when there are negative moments, but life is just that.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program is launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cut announced by Director-General John Fallon, predominantly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to his previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in a third cost-cutting program in May a cost-cutting plan for another 300 million pounds (US$394 million) to revive a business made by the rapid move towards digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged, having grown from 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Soldier Killed in Suicide Attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the Qarabagh district incident.
The bombing is Afghanistan’s last violent attack this month – more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a “person-carried improvised explosive device.”
The statement states that all injured people are in stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people in the country’s deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led forces displaced the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump considers increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public trust in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay Obama’s government regulation requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced the decision late on Wednesday to advance the so-called “ozone regulations 2015,” saying it showed the agency’s commitment to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners,” said EPA CEO Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June the EPA’s intention to delay ozone regulations – which are to measure pollutant emissions in part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by one year by October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has tried to push back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the efforts have triggered the setback of democrats and nature conservation groups, who are concerned about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says that inhaling air that contains ozone “can reduce lung function and intensify respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
The City Council wants a common area
In the end, the decision was clear: In the event of two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future senior housing complex.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still be a long time before the area belonging to the parish is in municipal ownership, there is now no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be funded by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common area.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intends to provide such a common space not only as a meeting place for the residents of senior citizens, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "trickcafé" made the round.
The decision, which has already been taken by the provision of appropriations for the current budget last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is located in the renovation area.
The establishment of a common space would, according to Tjaden, be eligible with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that they do not want to throw clubs between their legs in this respect, the proposal provides for the determination that both the saddle - which is based on the surrounding construction - and the desk roof - which reduces the eaves height and makes the construction more economical.
Unnecessary, so does not only Wilfried Sohmer, be this addition.
If it helps, unanimously he passes the panel.
The common space is not that easy.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which you do not get very forward, but you now lean out of the window at the common room, she says: "I am having a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common space - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not so, because with the acquisition of the area one does not give a grant, but gets a real, marketable equivalent, in case of doubt, is the counter-speech.
Staiger’s request to split the draft decision accordingly has three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclist is thrown on the road
On Wednesday, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught and seriously injured by a car in Garath.
As the police announced, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been coming from Hilden with his bike on the bike path of the Schwarzer Weg.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the level of the Am Buchholzer Busch road.
A car driver in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove to the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the reverse traffic.
He crashed with a car that drove a 66-year-old Hilden.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich has to renounce David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without him: David Alaba has to make the game against Dortmund.
With personnel worries, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first compulsory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The staff worries at the German football record champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 am / ZDF and Eurosport) at the cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also renounce David Alaba in a duel with BVB.
The Italians confirmed this on Friday.
Also missing are the Munich players Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and the lack of balance in his team’s game.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding: “The most important point is the balance in the team.
It wasn’t good at last.”
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently,” said Ancelotti, who expects a “difficult, intense game.”
The duel of the two German football heavyweights attracts fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walking from star to star in the Harz
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the Sankt Andreasberg Observatory.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it said.
He combines nature, science, exercise and sporting performance.
Members want to set up boards along the planned route and then inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association is planning "reachable installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber would be in question.
The information on the boards should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of interesting things, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars have different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, although it is much further away.
It also tells us which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best seen.
The association has been operating the highest-located observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be seen with the naked eye.
Since 2003, on the initiative of the sponsoring association Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned star yard - the planetary path.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (Gemeinde Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimeters.
The total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
But the march to the next fixed star would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future below 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, up to Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, going down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck.”
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
As the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the “perfect magnitude.”
“I’m a former featherweight,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to make a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the forum on September 23.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it,” Garcia said, later openly expressing himself to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready...”
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as “an enormous fighter,” and he may be participating in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said he thinks the tri-battle champion from Riverside "looks very slow, I'm sorry Mikey...you wanted the co-off."
Garcia said the focus was to show impact strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum building up for their own struggle.
“This is the battle that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after Reifenplatzer
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira probably lost control of his vehicle around 4:30 p.m. shortly before the junction Marktbreit.
The car hurled to the right into the estuary, where it crossed over and then lay on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident.
During the first care of the injured by the ambulance service, the A7 was closed in the direction of the north for about an hour, after which the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2-2 season opener against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation brings in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season match, with the result too, if not the two opponents had been in the 2-2 against Braunschweig.
“Those were two goals too much, and we have to be even more careful in Aue,” says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the three-chain will also be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick the fortunes don't want to catch themselves anymore.
“For the future, it will be that no one will stand next to Michael (Rensing) on the line.”
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better with the three-way chain, even after the experience in the preparation, than with the four-way chain.
“I still don’t know how we’ll operate in Aue,” says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his point, “because we have players in the three-tier chain on the half-time positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well,” Hoffmann said.
"It's a prerequisite, but that we're even better at harmonizing and we don't afford to make so many playback mistakes."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can speak of a failed start after a tie, you don't know.
The performance could be okay,” Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand with four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper season start."
His coach didn’t want to know about it.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely due to a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said, believing that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher because they don't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a climbing favorite in the bones.
“But they don’t know 100% where they are at the moment,” says Fortuna’s internal defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland will go as an easy favorite on Sunday to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we have the claim to be in the first six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset,” explains Fortuna’s head coach.
“To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant.”
And so Funkel does not want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests published
Recent results from tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the subjects tested are over 18 years of age. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authority for forensic medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started to conduct the tests last year.
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was “possibly 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person “possibly under 18 years of age.”
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent in recent months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that “suggest that the person examined was 18 years of age or older.”
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly stated that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI shots of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing people’s biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
Evaluating biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t pretend we could,” he told Metro.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child incorrectly as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in this case that’s about 10 percent.”
Full of plan
Work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the department of roads and transport at the government headquarters in Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The construction is planned for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete arched bridge clad in red sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now grown into years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now being thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge fastening that is also used as an operating path.
On Friday, a 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap will be installed on the southern part of the bridge.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing about this is that they are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The installation of cables through the building in Lauterbach has required a special touch.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by means of leaflets.
In addition, fish and crustaceans had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The total cost of the three bridge renovations is 700,000 euros.
It is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to put together.
The parties (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) represented in the district day Vulkaneifel belong to a broad alliance that peacefully displays the flag on this day, because the AfD invites the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster "big campaign start".
And brings well-known names to the start - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland will be the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24, and Deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event, do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that offers itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the Forums A World and one of the leading organizers, really enjoys: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There is music and plenty of food, including an "urdeutscher Kartoffelsalat, which the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought it with her.
The police have ordered many officials to go to Gerolstein, and they are also present at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually get on Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has tried such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially inquired in Daun, but there received a rejection, because due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes there are not enough parking spaces.
So now the Rondell, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event at Rondellvorplatz, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
It also does this: around 8 p.m. a band will provide entertainment on Rondell’s square, and various speakers in the town hall, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the courtyard have a longer breath, but there is also the opportunity to tidy up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can escape - no special incidents.
Trumpet meets trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli will take place in the series Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is solo trombonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new costume, Daniel Schnyder's "world music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz echo prize winner Nils Woogram, classical music, jazz and free play blend into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core piece of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Woogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality.
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything,” Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
"When I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what's next?'"
Probably the Hollywood star's best-known relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ended up bitterly disintegrating.
Despite all this, the brunette actress reassures Harper’s Bazaar magazine: “I was seriously in love with everyone I’ve dated.
Do you think I played it?”
After her separation, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: “I have always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously.”
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered in particular, but in school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I was going to look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think, ‘Girl, be proud of you!’”
She doesn’t like to explain her love life to the public in particular: “People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And some may call me ungrateful, but I don’t like to have to justify myself in front of the public.”
The Governor of West Virginia Announces Changing the Party
Democratic Governor of West Virginia Jim Justice announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me,” Justice said.
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I will tell you, as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor.”
The rally erupted in jubilation.
“Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play another game.”
Mr. Trump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying, “Governor Justice’s change of party is another blow to a Democratic party that would rather hinder us than work to make our country great again.”
“With only 15 governors and the control of the fewest legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and unable to find a positive, unifying message,” RNC chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises “honest” Russian apology for doping scandal
World leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, on Thursday praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated into the sport.
Russia’s Athletics Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the Athletics World Championships that his country’s expulsion from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all athletes who were snatched gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of government-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.”
Coe said he was also “rejoiced” that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the time to reinstate Russia,” Coe said.
“We need to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which will begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
IAAF Task Force leader Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned coaches are still free to act, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Mourning act for soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, around 1,000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali have been remembered.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
On the unexplained cause of the crash, Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She described the two pilots as "cowards of her profession."
“We bow down to this highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany,” she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Hesse died on Wednesday a week ago in West African Mali.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death guard of the Bundeswehr to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter.
At noon only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid down roses, the relatives were arm in arm at the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Minister of Defence von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and deployed.
The chief of staff had also built up the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also stated: “If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to do it.”
Minister von der Leyen did not show doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the operation was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they were buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bj?rn N?rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two of them.
The Queen agrees with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear.
He did not intend to be buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title.
After his wife Margrethe ascended the throne in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also took the title "Prince's Husband".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family, explained.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be, is still unclear.
But he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for over 50 years.
Born Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
He worked at the Thames in the French embassy.
While his later wife always flew to the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult time with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of the first years in Denmark: “A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was volatile, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation here in Germany for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I couldn’t hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP face possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony’s Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick re-election of the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday, it was in favour of the dissolution of parliament.
Previously, the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state parliamentary elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in the parliament to the opposition from the CDU and the FDP.
The former Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
“I see my political future in the CDU,” she said in Hannover on Friday.
Björn Thümler, the head of the CDU group, wants to recommend his group to include them.
Thus, the CDU and the FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new Landtag will be elected on 14 January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to rule without a majority in this situation.
However, Stephan Weil considers it indispensable that the Landtag decides as quickly as possible on its own.
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility of the state parliament depriving the prime minister of trust and electing a successor.
“Our Constitution offers several options.
These options need to be checked legally cleanly,” Thümler said.
"All questions will be discussed in peace, if they are legally considered reasonable."
Thümler called Twesten’s move “something curious.”
The politician himself stressed, “I am not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She called herself a supporter of Black Green.
The Greens called on the apostate MPs to return their mandate to the Landtag.
“We assume, of course, that she returns her parliamentary mandate, which she has received via the green country list, with immediate effect,” state presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said.
Green Group leader Anja Piel said: “We are extremely sorry for Elke Twesten’s decision.”
She deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
"Even in the light of the fact that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the passage of the Lower Saxony Green Party member Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
“The behavior of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of red-green,” the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to have the Landtag re-elected quickly.
The exit of Twesten costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician put “in her hurt vanity and frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country,” SPD secretary-general Hubertus Heil criticized.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and tries to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The head of the SPD group in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a very thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is speaking and answering in an interview with the German editorial network (RND).
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp imprint.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states post the latest information about the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to what we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take on the best possible crisis response – all eggs out of the supply – because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of the concern of Germany.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are mobile and safe for health.
If the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg is exceeded for eggs, they are not mobile.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time it is not the company’s fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Rather, they are expected to suffer economic damage as a result of allegedly illegal practices by service providers.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is it just lacking in personnel or in conclusive competence?
It was the official controls that revealed the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent.
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences may exist are crucial.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect complete information from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and mobile food.
When an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
By means of the armored means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
Basically, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the holding of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and completely.
How Football’s Financial Rules Affect Neymar’s Moving to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending on European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences for Paris Saint-Germain will still come from UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of income that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA President in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs’ debt to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – was to become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP predisposition period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini’s disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to work to deter excessive spending.
"Surely, FFP is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer amount of 44.4 million euros can be reported in the annual financial statements for the next five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, along with Abu Dhabi owned by Manchester City, has hit PSG with the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of €60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial oversight by inflating their revenues through companies associated with the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
That’s exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come through payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will be a World Cup ambassador and that such a manoeuvre could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to every attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar’s transfer, said the people familiar with the situation on Thursday.
They spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best footballers go, and they tried to prevent Neymar’s departure by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP.
"It's a clear case of 'financial doping' with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that finances a club.
“It’s the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger said.
“As soon as a country has a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country.”
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggilieferant
In recent years, Chocolat has made Frey on-board chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: the airline is rewriting the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products are checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Approximately 17 million small red-white packaged chocolate boards at 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to disclose the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a Schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
The Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was unavailable for a statement.
The Swiss have been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug.
Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, customers of the First Class will be pampered with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi from Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short-haul route, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup and was only able to watch the discus competition from the stand.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters far, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80’s, for the 90’s Grunge era (when thought leaders David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy “The State” for MTV), and for themselves – that is, for 2001 before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler Paul went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By stiffening themselves to the core of the gag -- middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up -- they nevertheless managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults playing now adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more to the watering can principle, including a riff on the stalker movies of the 90s like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Rocks the Cradle").
At one point, a character roams through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates, and “a number of other things from 1991.”
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-evil plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon’s lower lip beard from “Singles”, whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive “Seven Up!” series until it reaches what I take as its logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” whose final scene the band will show as it will attend the film premiere of “Wet Hot American Summer.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon reminds of a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-to-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas as director, claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-hitting Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game 'Find the voice out'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama -- a murderer who wears a Reagan mask is involved -- that it often plays like a single one.
Six long episodes take place, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.
“Comrade Detective,” which was edited to a smaller length, could better deliver his agitprop satires as Gregor and Iosef keep visiting the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything the food for a brawl.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Strike against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor’s office Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 people between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects.
Both are likely to be delivered to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, there were over 300 police officers in action.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder, and robbery and blackmail.
Since summer 2016, the public prosecutor’s office has been investigating the organized drug trafficking in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large operation on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations focused mainly on Italian nationals with a close connection to the Italian mafia.
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen, in which several shots were fired at a restaurant in the early morning, is likely to go to the account of the gang.
Wise complains of major gaps in the foreigner register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to one report, the foreigner register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government’s Commissioner for Refugee Management, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partially serious wrong decisions" in asylum proceedings and deportations, warns way in an analysis available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
The register covers 10 million people with foreign nationality, including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data has not been maintained sufficiently, the data quality has not been good in some parts so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register."
“Faultful data inputs can significantly slow return processes,” the report said.
The statistics on people who are required to leave also cover EU citizens who do not have to leave at all.
Such false allocations, however, led to “a distorted debate about how to deal with people who are required to leave,” according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government apparently started sending refugee families with children under 16 back to Italy when they arrived from there.
This is according to an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
According to the paper, the BAMF has been carrying out such procedures "regarding families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, citing the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, the EU country that they first reach is responsible for refugees.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
The office now writes: “In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly.”
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, spokeswoman for the Left Party in the Bundestag, criticized this decision: “Families with children are threatened with inhumane reception conditions and a threat to the child’s well-being because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system.”
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already available to other people.
At least of the 12 people who were honored on Friday.
Above all, Jürgen Greule, who shared 50 liters of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, at the council meeting, the community recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood.
“It’s ingenious how our body is designed to do this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even more so, unselfishly,” Mayor Karlheinz Kistner said.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the circuit readiness manager of the German Red Cross (DRC), Holger Maisenbacher, because the cans are decomposed into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions being carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
“This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result,” said the DRC District Readiness Director.
Apparently, the change to the theater house led to higher attendances a few years ago.
Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were already among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half that number are Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave up ten times each 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation have dampened speculation about an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintains interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% for 2017 and 1.6% for 2018, warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn.
But it signaled that in the next few years, interest rate increases would be needed to curb inflation fuelled by Brexit, and it said that credit costs might need to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide  pounds 15 billion more under this system - with  pounds 115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term as the pressure on real incomes of households continues to burden consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "slightly greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be “step-by-step” and “limited”.
The Bank’s downwardly adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the forecasts in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and fell by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision does not change after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an interest rate hike and GDP has risen from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly towards the end of the year after the bank.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases, as the tightening first gets worse before it will improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot “prevent” income drop in the next few years, but she added that wages will “significantly” recover at the end of her three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods, due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to reach prices and the economy completely.
Prior to the Bank’s last ruling on interest rates, demand for an interest rate increase had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a 0.5% increase in July.
Inflation has fallen from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in the past month, although the bank said it was expected to do so and will attract it again in the coming months.
The bank said the overrun in relation to its target of 2% was “whole” attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders are looking for deals loudly and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who are running out of existing deals and taking out new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) to Prescribe Controversial HIV Drugs to 10,000 People
Patients will be given access to a “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September onwards after a fight in front of the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken prior to sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service through an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the appeals court confirmed a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an “important new intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be launched across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a sequence of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so as early as two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and individuals with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be worth 10 million pounds and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week after an international competitive sourcing.
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, absorbed and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted to people in need and at risk, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September onwards, people at high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority must now be that the study is conducted quickly across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Secretary, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it’s important that this study is conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.”
Living the Big Life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, narrowed down from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” Joanne says.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day.”
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
“The steelworks are quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.
It wasn't just about building a simple platform, it was about laying the steel so that it had the right height for the function up or down."
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other in full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window by Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not used.
Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’ll sell the floor space – or how your property is valued,” says Erfan.
“In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the land size.”
Here they have managed to increase the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard into something quite amazing through good design and increased square footage.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this.
Brothers fight over $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers find themselves in a quarrel four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to split their property and business assets.
Paul had wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers owned 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded Jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes city center offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development areas, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - described by Paul as the "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third.
According to a court case, this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.
“The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business, which Colin, as Paul claims, has ruled out.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages containing affidavits, emails, and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and both-sided law firms.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school when Paul was a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to give their property to their sons amicably.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke was paid $26 million.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says, “have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation.”
Colin has been very reluctant, despite being a former AFL board member and Eddie McGuire's best friend after a 2015 biography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say “I really can’t say much” because the case was in court.
“It’s very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father wouldn’t have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
This hope seemed to be over on Friday.
“Our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media abstinence.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in hopes of keeping the boss on a more uniform course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wants to fix: bad information coming into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow – whether on paper or in briefings – because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions that were to be persuaded,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes steady praise.”
Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know about others – that without their interventions, Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuel.
We’re probably never going to know about the tweets that Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have managed to keep him away from trouble a few times, then their efforts have been worth it.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from provoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world.
Politico - wholly busy with this story - reported in May about the advisers' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffened by where they come from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being “the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence, or that he has made false accusations and revoked them in the past.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter “attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives.”
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals receive mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not naturally known, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action that follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of the winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding from holiday destinations, Europol said.
They have compiled 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
The website www.eumostwanted has been around since 2016 and has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online requests have so far been detained, at least eleven of them on the basis of references made after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'millionaire series'
Some of the West Midlands’ wealthiest homeowners are again on war foot with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the “millionaires’ series.”
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May, but without being deterred by a trench excavated by the council to prevent their raids.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have oppressed Solihull’s council, which said it was “useless to deal with the problem.”
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passersby.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, because it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long lessons to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I’m not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can’t even stop that.”
A resident who didn’t want to be named said, “It’s ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you’ve even seen a horse in the parking lot.”
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: “We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihull Police and we are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they move on as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to examine when we are submitting our case.”
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
From the former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
This is good news for the city.
After all, with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and income was also lost by the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, given the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the county office as a collective accommodation, which led to controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed in the city council at the time.
But especially the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and already at that time spoke of serious interested parties in the house.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, there have been building debris containers in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovations are being carried out.
The floors were torn out, blankets partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should become "beautiful close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry."
Swimming pool, wellness area and meeting room are available.
They do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, Scherer emphasizes.
The Waldhotel Luise with its about 60 rooms wants to set up wide, Scherer explains further.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already had talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the amount of the investments, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Less than a million dollars, he said.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the forefront, this is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US special investigator appoints grand jury
In the Russia affair with US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the move to be a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas from the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of deliberately meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took a closer look at Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator had personally brought Trump to the center, investigating the accusation of the president possibly hindering the justice system in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine available evidence in possible crimes and decide whether to indict.
Grand Jurys are also called Chambers of Indictment.
Most of the time, they are turned on when there are major and controversial cases.
The process is always done behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called on by the public prosecutor’s office to summon persons for interrogation under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign chief Paul Manafort were also present.
Legal experts said Thursday evening on U.S. television that the deployment shows that Mueller is not intimidated by his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the indictment.
Nevertheless, the appointment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a chance to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special adviser Ty Cobb said in a statement that he did not know about the appointment of a grand jury.
They usually work in secret, he said.
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president will not be investigated.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
However, Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this eviction, allegations against Trump that he wanted to impede the justice system had come up.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump would like to release Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional Special Counsel, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position where he could be theoretically fired by the Department of Justice at the president’s insistence.
However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills Thursday that would make it difficult for the special investigator to be dismissed.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg floating in Antarctica
In Western Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the shellfish.
This was announced by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The colossus, weighing over a billion tons and 5,800 square kilometers, is now driving north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded over the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years, writes the U.S. Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) in a background of facts.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The colossus, which has now been broken down, has been part of the Larsen-C ice sheet so far.
Shellfish floats on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly.
The Larsen C ice sheet is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of growth and breaking was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shellfish had decayed there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C ice cream is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it currently is.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks down at a key point.
The melting of shellfish and iceberg does not raise sea level as it swims on the water and displaces ice as much water as it yields after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shelf ice means that the glaciers can open directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could potentially increase sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on Antarctica (Midas).
According to the AWI, the Larsen C shellfish is the fourth largest shellfish in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it regularly breaks down.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now in a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University.
“This is the furthest withdrawal since the beginning of the records,” he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen C shelf will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: “Our models say it will be less stable.”
But this development will take decades.
Although these researchers do not attribute the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature increase contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees over the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants house tariff for staff
As it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU demands to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the district day had 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work.
The teaching positions in the circle are obviously highly sought after.
There were approximately 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks staff in order to be able to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
There are currently 50 unoccupied positions in the Mettmann district.
Doctors and engineers are sought, among others, as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the district day and counter the lack of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration should, at the request of the parties, "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but also to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for lateral beginners and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.
That sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn’t know about in the past.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real “competition of public employers”.
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is time to take action so that no more positions remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, head of the CDU, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He recently caused a big surprise in the district when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cover and stunned the other parties.
Völker would like to see all possibilities for leaving the local employers’ association reviewed.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district-member cities," says Völker.
With this, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than the collective bargaining rules for the public service actually provide.
Salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you move to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up, where employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Land Councilor Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens tone to NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue to do so unless they follow new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs don’t sign a new code of conduct, it’s hard to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minnitis’ warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organization ‘Jugend Rettet’ because their team had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement to social media.
“We can only judge any accusations that are currently being made after we have gathered all the information and are able to judge the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take inflatable migrants on board, which will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting was said to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the file of the prosecutor, whose content was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard to monitor rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring “substantial changes or obstructions” to their rescue operations.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors have been fruitful.
“Over the last few days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Rise and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The Burg- und Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
There followed viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far beyond the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, the viewpoint ranked at the viewpoint, linked by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
Over the last two days, there have been a lot of heights.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed healing brine in the outdoor inhaler.
Neustadt was also driven.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - athletically and culturally.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga prepares for e-sports
Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of sweating over the stadium grass in the wind and weather?
The fact is: e-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags included.
The first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area, have recognized this as well.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, later FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there are still a lot of clubs on this train."
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Federation will be organizing the first Interactive Club World Cup in London, where the gamers from different clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
“Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future,” says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, you could be much more present on these markets online than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or even the football simulation FIFA are contested at the competitive level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have established themselves, in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the Asia Games 2022, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it really a sport?
For many, the idea is certainly in need of getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also dealt with the question for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress responses, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response ability.
Professional gamers should train not only on the console, but also their bodies and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were lacking.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
Players travel internationally, which is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales will be 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, that is little.
However, e-sports “is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” write the Deloitte consultants.
Many countries are still international.
Large markets are Asia and the USA, where former basketball player Shaquille O’Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, football leagues are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
“In European comparison, Germany is lagging behind,” explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
Just falling into nostalgia, and clarifying the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is about maintaining the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company in the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” says Dutt.
“You can’t hold on to the fact that only in football will everything stay the same as it always was.”
Poison eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
By now, almost all federal states have been affected by the scandal of poison-contaminated eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have responded and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown to contain no fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter sentenced for texts pushing Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is inconsolable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes facing down when she was convicted.
“Your actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility,” she said.
“She didn’t show regret.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “horrible circumstance that she totally regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find out that her “age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, stating that “there is no day when I don’t mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything, and I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would be "traced" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
“Not having that one person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter’s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
“Raise up, jump from a building, pee yourself, I don’t know there are many ways,” she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, “You have to do it, Conrad” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through Roy’s death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison.”
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from the new mini-lam from FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to compete as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner for a big season – extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer were to be seen, he stopped his hand at the tie assigned to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner told after his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the score could have been better than the 0-2 against SSC Naples.
But the coach’s sign could also interpret Kimmich that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the game leader in the C-Elf consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals just coming out of the holiday, but he.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those you trust a lot of people you want to keep in your mood.
So if you have been chosen to take on the legacy of lame, you can only use a little extra motivation.
Kimmich said, “This is what you want as a player: take responsibility.”
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flashed over the field as a mini-lam.
Right back, that is now his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest.
And in general, Kimmich looked like the one in this starting formation who can best take the rudder in his hand.
He gave instructions, trying to steer the undefeated force.
He had the eye for it all, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (barely worked); Renato Sanches with getting out on Teufel to the achievements of the Asia trip (worked even conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not getting negatively noticed in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked out quite well.
Süle ran next to Kimmich, Rudy up in front of the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried to build the game a few times successfully.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result “was not as we had hoped.”
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shift, pace change: "I was also brought for this style."
How unfamiliar this Bavarian world is for the newcomers was seen after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
In Bavaria, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he doesn’t have to teach the new.
Alaba motivates ÖFB women
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bavarian legionnaire is almost club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and fever with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Bayern-Dusel might also need our ladies well.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy was often unforgiving, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy on T V’s request – and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: The gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
The Ministry hopes to see a planning procedure later this year, and the construction law is set to stand by 2021.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the western circumvention of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport routes plan.
The aim is to commission the route in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
As suggested by Wissing, the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) in Trier is seeking a Rheinland-Pfalz label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sagging for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, the IHK praises.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young apprentices, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is envisaged for the master’s examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years after the master’s training.
The homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is quick to create facts, and at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, CEO of the IHK Trier.
Only 29 of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state-owned mobility company have so far been filled.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU Vice-President Christian Baldauf points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, as it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
Sobering is also the existing broadband expansion in the country.
In 2016, regional companies only rated the power supply with a rating of 3.4 in an IHK survey.
They complained about stagnant internet connections and demolitions.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and is still on the Supervisory Board of the wind turbine company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where they already cleared the field after four months due to disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - carmakers face a counter-reaction
A day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes “there are smarter options than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is based – to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the business as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install systems to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of hugging the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could control the use of so-called shut-off devices that regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested but declined under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi’s engine development in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded.
Involvement of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profits.
This message was sent to the raft on the Isar on Saturday.
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft runs through Munich tomorrow, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the building department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information transparent.
It shows a garbage dump.
The start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is . . ." the aim is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river.
Already last summer the raft crossed the Isar and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's Noses and the Laughing at Suffering
Mordillo was, at times, one of the most widely published cartoon drawings, the tuber noses of his characters are his trademark.
At the age of 85, the Argentinian is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: “Laughter, for there is too much suffering in the world.”
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his first years as an artist, he beat himself as a drawer for greeting cards, among other things - which frustrated him.
“The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job,” he said.
After stopping in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s with the release of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in Star and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found a lot of fans.
Time and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, rounded Mordillo figures roam in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he says he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his playful figures continue to be widely used worldwide.
For six years he has also worked on an animated film and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footer as an opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which will be released on the cinema screen in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s weird to me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he rather relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is wordlessly produced.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-borne insects, causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacteria that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said, “Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped, and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.”
Solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and developing varieties that are more resistant to dryness.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Merchants, guilds, merchants, vagantes or a landsknecht camp are to be experienced in the city centre on these days.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They were told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings are sufficient.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the government’s payroll or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and as the bodies pile up across the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the murders of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and even more treacherous now.
Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little use, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
"As long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot at him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and its extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
It doesn’t matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot in the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings larger than many houses for the living.
For a minute, forget that there is a state of “rest” when only a cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the blame for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First there was the release in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish rigorous research without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabo Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee for the Protection of Journalists’ International Press Freedom Award for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it took him.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
“You have to do the job you do as a journalist – either that or you’re playing the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn’t you say what was going on?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a harbor worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
He trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his ruin?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you engage with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, cell phones were suddenly not allowed. Days earlier, it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40°C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself called untrustworthy.
It’s been months since the reporters went to the mountain scenery, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group who carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it came time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
One reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have viewed the Valdez column as the best-informed source of the kidnapping.
"We used to know what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body shape.
“Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
Valdez’s office has been transformed into a repository for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because the staff have become something they never expected themselves: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the prosecutor’s office for a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by writing “SOS Press” in organized protests on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked that she be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, government officials involved in it, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only being killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under cover with the organized crime.
The media guard group Articulo 19 has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “Here I am because of my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it’s a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started buzzing.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region.
From the curb, they posted the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens were crying nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the policemen who were keeping watch to see if they were ready.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
“How can you even think of closing,” said Bojorquez, “when on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for coverage.”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though a terrifying one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner’s incredible rhino were so well preserved that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well-preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown – and they said she had had something of an “uneasy past.”
The report in the journal “Current Biology” described him as “the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He encountered something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) clums of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered with armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to mix better into its environment and dodge its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershade, a common method of defense in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although the countershade is common, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta far exceeds that of animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use counter-shading – think of deer, zebras, or shingles – are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodo-acid was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous era must have been," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he was thrown into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the seabed.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far further inland than they are today.
“This nodesaurus is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions, maintaining the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just peel a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that after death, Borealopelta was sunk in the sea and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from snout to hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that projected from his shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore was floated through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as 'rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
In the thunderstorm: mass carambolage on A8: many injured
A severe accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolic situation.
There are numerous injuries, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolation on Thursday afternoon.
According to the police, around 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen junctions (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were collided.
Initially, there was no information on the exact number of injuries.
These are minor to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the accident site.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre long backlog was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive handicaps on the back lane - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire brigade recorded the license plates of the vehicle drivers, which are now subject to sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the accident site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests 'comfort check-in'
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: you don’t know anything about sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you are immersed in your work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then, pufff.
Comes the creator and wakes up an unsympathetic one or tears the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unfit ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket.
Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.
“Come on offer, we’ll expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," said a railway spokesman.
"Comfort check-in" is the name of the train ticket devaluation without a driver.
However, in order to be able to use them, a number of conditions must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers already do.
You also need to use the app of the train that DB Navigator bought, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, call your ticket under "My tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear for the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is on the train and has taken up the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at the ticket checkpoint Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, keep working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without a ticket check by our train crew, simply check in in the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board Member of DB Fernverkehr.
“And our employees have more time than they have today to respond to individual customer needs.”
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need for devaluation of online tickets.
Either the credit card or identity card or any other document that you have to present is missing.
The result is endless discussions between train attendants and passengers, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in controlling your own ticket and the creator takes the time to take care of other concerns at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis-born was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
“The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it’s still in the street,” it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle :-) was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the St. Louis area was about to live tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“That’s wild,” Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new for them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police gang and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who wore a sign with the inscription, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unlocked his rifle and shouted, “I’m going to kill you... animals all.”
“That’s not common,” Ferrell recalled her statement.
“This isn’t the kind of murder we’ve gotten used to and can be called typical.”
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, Whose Streets?, in theaters from the 11th onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, which consists from the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition.”
“You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?” she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn’t take her with me,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see and be raised in it.
It must be well-developed, knowing not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to become free, to free ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn’t personally experience blatant racism, she’s no different from the next black woman child.
I feel like I would do her a disservice to keep her away from it.”
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department that became a camp area when activists were waiting for officer Darren Wilson’s possible non-indictment.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism changed completely after August 9th," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
Everything has come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can take advantage of?”
This skepticism was nurtured by countless cases of people, often whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, “We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn’t center their voices and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals, followed the team of Whose Streets in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or speaks to us, we're talking," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that’s how I’ll be portrayed.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – to show that the movement “is not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together,” Folayan said – it proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from “Whose Streets?” surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell’s life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that there must be some vulnerability to this work and to the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell’s story reiterates the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives matte movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the movie BlacklivesMatter on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall,” Ferrell said, “and that’s why we’re constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything.”
Folayan agreed to note that “the movement is really being upheld by black women and many black women.”
However, she insists that “this is not an affirmative type of action” where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
“She was the person who stirred up that energy,” she said.
“It’s not a coincidence, though she was at the forefront, because there’s so much at stake in a life at these crossroads as a black, gay woman.
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial ties between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell is on parole for 2 1/2 years for blocking a highway in a demonstration.
She describes the social-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: “Chaos.”
Still, she clings to a song and feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "dream" to "madness of size": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into proponents and opponents since its first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the topic barely one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), from the other side comes: "Don't need a person" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Great Madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While proponents rely on one gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the shops, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the Farmers Market Hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of construction work it will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the Farmers Market Hall almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always very much like.
We also discovered the butchery for us.
We would like to have a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities, there is also.
The small market hall in Frankfurt in particular is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery, depends on the amount of rent.
However, this is not likely to be very low for the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of this in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Unfortunately, there are almost no more special shops and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A mall with a market hall does not fit in for me.
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the Farmers Market Hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the spook of Bit-Galerie manage to drive all the shops out of Bitburg beforehand?”
George Marquet: “It just won’t work.
And a shopping center that is empty doesn’t need anyone either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery.
But thanks to the insanely many - in my opinion - pointless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no room for a farmers' market hall.
If the Farmers Market Hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again.”
An Appropriate Similarity: Artist Creates Portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces – white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly similar – hanging from cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the snippets from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after she made public classified diplomatic reports through the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg’s algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning, which created 30 portraits of what someone might look like with these genomic data, has created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data – the many ways in which it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations – but also on identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but has been openly talking about identifying as a woman since puberty, was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud, and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning was visibly uncomfortable in a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stub and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the trash to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
“They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article,” Dewey-Hagborg said in a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic “Suppressed Images” illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the President would transform Chelsea’s judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy encounter.
There is also something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition now that Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and transgender troops to find new, tweet-enabled ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that “things happen for a reason.”
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her oversized signature underneath (the “i” in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to “automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture.”
On the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a millipede of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all, by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon).
“What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome doesn’t care who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that's 30 of those stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own space, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning showing up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
“If they cold your speech, they won,” it says.
“Never stop your mouth.”
“It came straight from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
“I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.”
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as predictively anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do so, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacles, which assemble like hordes of protesters.
That was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, right up to the size (5' 2, Manning's stature) where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation.”
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Killing
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are being sought as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the files of Cook County District Court.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A joint warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stabs as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on leave and had been excluded from entering Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that “we are in touch with the police in the UK and ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way possible.”
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to face up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to confront the authorities.
“The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "The police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
“We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard,” Mutko said.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the criteria stated in the list states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged government-sponsored doping in Russian sports.
Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we won’t admit something that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Speaking with the Russian sales outlet RSport earlier this day, Smirnov admitted problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
In November 2015, in the wake of the doping scandal, RUSADA was excluded from carrying out doping checks in Russia.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be reinstated.
Aldi will not sell eggs for the time being.
This was shared by the company groups.
It is a mere precautionary measure that no further health impairment can be assumed, it said in the communication.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to be negatively tested for fipronil-containing anti-intoxicant.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency for its customers.
The Start-Ups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your employees at your e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or – even worse – fraudulent.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
“There was simply never consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called out people from the outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-suite executives and contact the board directly.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to snap surveys and surveys from specific teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results – so you can track why.
Companies come to realize that you need to stay at the top of the workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were penalized.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion in value by 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let’s Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, who helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber trap in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized “pulse” surveys, collect confidential answers in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Managing Director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has captured regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to treat its employees poorly or behave unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope he or she was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and inconvenient experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues previously hidden in offices in cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices – can be identified and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values, and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took time for the “social media to come to their right” that companies realized they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitteren secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices, and that the work they do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful,” said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies do well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee engagement and deployment, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data about employee engagement is important to the experts of the workplace culture.
But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on its way.
And if change doesn’t come fast enough, or at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies relying too much on data collection.
"Because if you don't follow staff members ask themselves, 'Have you really heard me?
You'll take care of it?
And who you don't care about, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to take action the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, the speed of decision making and the quality of communication enabled her to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is constantly getting new insights about its employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee retention in an industry known for high revenues.
“If you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people,” Vitrano said.
“If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It’s up to 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center at 6:30 the next morning.
“This is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday turned Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease players’ load, and it has actually extended its days – at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three UCLA training sessions should start at 19:15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and performed practical exercises for the first time during the summer school during Mora’s six seasons in Westwood.
They are expected to hold 18 exercises in the course of August, 20 before the formal game preparations begin for their start against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA’s rule change, even adding another point to the players’ busy routes.
“We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep plastering, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center, a superior-class hotel that has already been thrown with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
“We will use our security,” Mora said.
“This is a real problem, and it’s not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then getting ready to record an exercise.
If you have the videotape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news to third-party fact-checkers and then show their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible fake news and send them to fact reviewers who may display results of the fact review from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May, and Germany supports a plan to penalize social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to realizing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Comic-Roman: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, little Scotney Castle was featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent, and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophasque Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
“I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years,” he says.
“What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.”
A Castle in England spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not Rhodes’ first book based on an archive: he wrote ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’ in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
“I only responded to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins,” he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because then they lit a fire because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were there.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months (“To be honest: I overvalued my welcome a bit”), all this seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
Scotney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was not fully accessed until 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years when aristocrats said, 'Oh, throw it in the attic.'
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps showing who owned what: "One might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that fought for the two families.
“Guys, let everything go its course!”
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer' following a man leaving the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says.
“The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought a uprising was a good start.
“Maybe the two are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler' depicting 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made years later when his coffin was unearthed).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be pretty crooks, constantly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women – I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to recruit insides.”
After the end of his service at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences.
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämanmäki, the site of an early 20th-century sanatorium that has since been demanded back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marian Chapel in Rhöndorf
With the concealment of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new umbrella brand (Roundshow of Thursday).
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz still want to keep the logo and slogan a secret by Thursday.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?" the makers of the action have been asking since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website unlocked yesterday.
“But we use this measure to attract your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it continues.
“It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point.”
It is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef will be able to pay an average five-digit amount for its new umbrella brand and campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on retirements and promotions in the officers' corps.
So too this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as it used to be, but in the office of the Prime Minister.
The deliberations were also attended by the five Vice-Premiers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, chaired by the Head of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt are being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the attempt to overthrow a “gift of God” by giving him the opportunity to “cleanse the armed forces completely.”
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unpleasantness in Military Headquarters".
In the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
The cleanup of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered the firing of another 7395 officials by decree, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the real lords of the country.
Three times they cleansed, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the military’s power step by step, not least by citing the European Union’s reform requirements.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately advancing the Islamization of the armed forces.
In Vocal Europe magazine, an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be “full of extremists and salafists” in a few years.
If this is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” NATO diplomats say.
Washington Changes Green Card Rules
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
It envisages lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining visas for a temporary work permit, and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. issuing green cards to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to refurbish route for Rennsteigshuttle
Time and again, in recent months, there has been a debate about the future of the racesteigshuttle - now it should be done very quickly.
Before the end of the year, the marudous route on which the tourist railway runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteigshuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is to begin later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
“With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is especially important for tourism,” said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of repairing the route was estimated at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalised, Sühl said.
The Ministry and South Thuringia Railways as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
“This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated,” said Sühl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a particularly popular railway connection between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rennsteig.
In recent months, a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also in some parts highly congested.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought 2017 couldn’t get any more crazy, a new report comes on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, I do.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of them, and we’re going to see them much more often,” Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs, choosing everything from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it gets even more troubling, as many robots possess the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible,” says the website of True Companion.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn’t like what you don’t like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in mood"!
There are many troubling aspects to this rise of sex robots – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the submissive feminine traits, the allusions to rape when you take a step toward Frigid (this is called reluctant) Farrah worry you the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
“If women can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks out of the marginal zones can be very educational in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people aren’t weird or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat, when there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the swallowed-up bodies and the pricked-out eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (although with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their “personalities,” the robots don’t represent real women.
They cannot separate from their companion or simply go away.
They have no mediation or background story, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or, to put it in the words of 2017: Maid
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a perplexity of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-chosen relatives.
We are all supposedly trying to make our filter bubbles burst.
Less has been noticed the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has been dealing with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the republican kinship she’d been struggling with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite oddly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it strikes me in a further context that this also entails significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his antics will no longer repudiate us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness compared to his standards.
I find myself nowadays infested with an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the madman – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which in fact appear to be very mild offences compared to Trump.
If Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in town when you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are grumpy and the animals are twisted to look over their own shoulders with fear - extremely dark and the climbing music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage – the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a big roundabout in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as it is where two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to rate my "experience" of transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
At the coffee house on the corner of my street, it’s the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip – this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood grinning apologetically while I was tired of the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for the second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was hospitalized for treating cuts on his wrists, which he suffered according to prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors for a first manslaughter sentence.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against Pistorius’ six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius is in danger of raising his sentence to 15 years if the prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth-graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to secondary schools.
In the future, three of the discharge students will go to high school, four to secondary school.
School head Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
The 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm but was then released to freedom.
To this end, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken Farm".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched from his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken broke, the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
Afterwards, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s study.
The hens danced with the young gockels, the cylinders carried to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school principal Angelika Sitte.
The juvenile is different from the other juveniles (kitchens), but it is part of it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader would feel welcome in his new school.
This was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who keeps jumping in on school shortages, and the parents’ representatives.
The chick age is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She was very reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all students sang a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy among the children.
Eight first grade students have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, said.
On the morning of August 1, a group of illegal tenting people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day while an investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles: What Affected People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the campaign?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the emission behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt from this.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action compulsory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the coming months, but have not yet specified an exact date.
Daimler has advised to write to every person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, it will be done within its framework.
How long will the conversions take?
“It’s hard to say,” Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
“We have seen that car manufacturers have not yet acted voluntarily on the subject of the environment.”
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises you to wait.
Foreign manufacturers are likely to follow suit, Smetanin said.
Is there a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there has been no loss of value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the winners does not want to come – out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), as well as choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) will also be among the honored.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will hold a reception and participate in the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will refrain from participating in the gala.
“This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even depriving them of funds – and that weighs me down.”
59-year-old Estefan said she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
Named after former President John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city liveable
Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.
The job is already advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still a lot of fun for him, as he conveys in the press interview.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application so far meets the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
In this way, while respecting the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for training.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must have corresponding degrees.
This function is what the city wants to keep.
If she could no longer fill them, the citizens would have to drive to Offenburg for consultation.
But closeness to citizens is important to the city and to himself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working climate and a good mood between authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city liveable," he is sure about the construction office and his employees.
But there will also be varied projects on the agenda in the future: The redesign of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, has been initiated.
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, stadium renovation is still a topic.
The latter alone will pay about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
“All in all, great tasks await my successor.
Work here is fun.”
In terms of design, there is a great leeway for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own farm and nursery, many things can be reacted to quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is protected as a monument, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything is over my table."
In terms of support and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (construction) has been with him for ten years, Manfred Schöner (embedded construction) has been with him for 15 years.
Wacker also wants his successor to stay for a long time: “We are looking for someone who really wants to identify with the position and stay.”
Continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you would like to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to have a diploma in engineering or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good expertise in the field of building regulations and building planning law.
The municipal construction office is responsible for construction and civil engineering, building management planning, land acquisition, administration of urban properties, municipal farm with a building yard and urban gardening, as well as the Lower Building Law Authority including heritage protection.
Bicycle thrown on wires: South railway line closed
According to police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were damaged so badly that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours.
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed near the scene.
“This goes far beyond a lobster strike,” ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the minutes of delay and the costs of rail replacement traffic, ponals of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators.
Overall, it should be assumed that there is a “significant” sum, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the south railway line could be run without obstacles.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of them concerned long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million people in the U.S. and 300,000 in the U.K. causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
Lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal mucus, if the same system also works in humans.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequencing and six types of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells emerged.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid – without the bacteria – to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of the tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 milk acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, a “genius” has signed with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea’s 40-million-pound signature began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid began on Tuesday, and impressed in the Holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him get ready sooner than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted that the club had already done a “fantastic job” of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
“To get three out of four, I thank the club for that,” he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve made a lot of effort.”
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
The American aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle, Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved across the US in the form of a dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a dreamliner.
This was a test of endurance for new engines.
Boeing had previously made such advertisements.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
When Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections.
Just no disturbances from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the electoral campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with a headwind.
It was deep blows.
One after the other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"That shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the German editorial network (RND).
The surprising faction exit of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a severe crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Greens Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Lower Saxony Greens MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The move to the CDU signifies a clear distortion of the will of the electorate.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
“That shouldn’t be true at all,” sighs a SPD campaigner when the new Job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands there without a government majority after the transition of the Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the temporary culmination of a series of major and minor crises in SPD national associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades at the time calmed down.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
Then it became - and everything became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to tumble, and the Dusseldorf-Plage overthrew the party smoothly.
The comrades rejoined in the following weeks.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, came the G-20 summit of Hamburg.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because he did pretty much everything wrong in crisis communication afterwards.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
So is Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticized for a long time.
Misty survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has been trying more and more in recent weeks to set accents in the Bund.
The desire of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden from comrades around Martin Schulz.
They let him be granted, as they promised a stabilization of the party by Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Because there is basically no fault in the party-internal dispute between the Lower Saxony Greens.
Not even Schulz.
For the time being, the comrades are therefore trying to keep their ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all to the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and detrimental to democracy, as Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms. Twesten was elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but through the state list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MEP continued.
The logical consequence would be that she would return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an “undemocratic manoeuvre”.
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: The people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the Bundestag elections, the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked to clarify the background.
I want to know if there has been more or if there have been further commitments of the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for the city centre III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, between 1991 and 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.
In Rehabilitation Area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - after all, it is important to promote interior development and not only to open up new construction areas.
On April 4th, the Karlsruhe government received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounted to 833,333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a rehabilitation area come about?
According to Schindler, it will be investigated where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in refurbishment in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could also be shifted again.
The STEG represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-country program "Social City", in which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, i.e. per plot of land.
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as a statute.
The granting period for the grants runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September of this year, however, the inventory would be carried out, within the framework of which the participants in the rehabilitation area would be given a questionnaire to fill out.
If possible, the decision on the statutes should be taken in November or December, so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then stated that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing the urban deficiencies and deciding when and to what extent they will be refurbished.
A refurbishment note will then be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself would come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled in until after the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land sheet", which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the refurbishment intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet", information can be given on the size, division and inhabitants of a living space.
The blue "operating sheet" is only to be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also emphasized that the distribution of funding works according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
No funding can be “reserved” for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasty".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has partnered with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and only lasts 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of 300 pounds per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and on his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs thousands of dollars
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military, which was left to TIME magazine.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board was at the heart of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
“I just wanted you to be aware of this because it’s such an unusual event with high visibility,” the HMX-1 commander wrote to his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 around 7 in the morning for the event at 3 p.m., and remained until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limitation of the hours of service, a second crew would be needed for the return flight.
The original flight crew was with the helicopter during the event, while the security personnel of the unit stayed on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
The records provided to TIME did not clearly show whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," replied the deputy commander.
The “Made in America” event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo-op is uncommon.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
“The White House is thrilled with the show “Made In America” – which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the Washington area and in the South Lawn to drop the White House president with precise centimetre rates.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight for the “Made in America” event counted in the flight crew’s training requirements for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for “non-presidential support missions.”
The White House said taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to U.S. Department of Defense hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.
"Determining the cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At that time, the former White House press spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to showcase things made in America this week,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we’re all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
Of course, it is appropriate to emphasize that.”
It wasn’t clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his South Lawn tour for the event, but he sat down in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss in front of tricky task
The leader of the Second Tennis League competes in the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m. at the table third Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five matches still impeccable, the leader of the Second Tennis League has retained the sense of reality.
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a fairly similar formation.
Especially in the back positions I find the team very good."
For class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV especially the imports from the high north.
“These Danes and Finns can even refer to Davis Cup stakes.
And they are also strong in doubles,” Zay says with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“As always, it’s going to be hard for us.
You also need a good portion of luck.”
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His blue-and-white debut could be Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active Frenchman at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga game, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays at the tournament in the Czech Republic Liberec, comes to his first use this season.
The hitherto undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel with the white Russian Andrei Vasilevski.
He was to be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarian, who was number one in the Juniors World Ranking in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm the OMV
Donald Trump wasn’t really happy when he signed on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia.
“In his haste to enact the law,” Congress had packed in some “constitutional regulations,” he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels foamed against the US push.
After all, the draft envisages penalizing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the domestic OMV, which co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies, have been concerned since then.
The threatening scenery is huge.
Still, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which the company could defend and which could really hurt it.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be the focus of Netflix’s hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos unveiling Pablo Escobar’s killer, the Netflix series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first one received its first trailer and showed the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has focused its attention on the world’s richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godfathers, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peca, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Role backwards: The city sets 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the kita lunch table itself again.
With fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city’s daycare centers.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban daycare facilities (Kitas) again on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Aid, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooking continues outside the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked cooled.
The city runs 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
In the past year, 2,800 children were sitting at the tables, and the demand was growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the nursery," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m.."
46 part-time workers have kitchen service from 1 September: they heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean, rinse and clean the kitchen.
“The employees are firmly assigned to a nursery,” says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides the scope of the hours.
"The kitchen helpers are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"In this way, they are much more involved and it is easier for the nursery guidance to implement educational concepts."
This is also what it is all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
“Children should help prepare the food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known power in the nursery, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the nursery rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will in future be done by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of kitchen performance also the charm, which it has proven to be the most economical in comparison between self-direction and external allocation for the city, according to the press office.
And that even though 46 part-time workers are being re-employed.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women’s political role, UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in the provincial council elections, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban have released threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will pass power peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters have been registered.

Men try to rob a 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were reportedly attempting to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men contacted the 13-year-old who was with friends on Kolpingstraße at about 14.55 p.m. because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl’s cell phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
Then one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl’s phone and necklace, but that failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are underway.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to make sure to managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company was silent on the future of tollcross investment.
More than 500 employees work at the factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies among other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would “know first” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s branch manager, GMB Scotland urged McVitie’s to “express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward.”
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the general site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, in the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.”
A Pladis spokeswoman said: “The branch manager at Tollcross just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the ongoing engagement with employees and trade union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: “Over the past few years, we’ve invested more than 5 million pounds in our tollcross site, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and should our operations change, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to find out."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t give up in her pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of 189 million pounds to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach fueled the transfer window this summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
After completion, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is furious at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned by the PSG president about this prospect three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG’s best players signed.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we’ll be in opposition to them, we’ll contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign one of our players with them, it will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international to leave Italy under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers to Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the estate number 30 and thus caused property damage to the disguise of the vehicle of over 200 euros.
The Schramberg police, phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for clues.
For an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car met him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touched the control board.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was heading for Leese on the B 215 coming from Stolzenau with his VW around 7.55 p.m.
In the area around Stolzenau, a car met him on his lane, so he had to turn to the right.
The Touran driver touched the board.
There was damage to the car.
The driver of the approaching car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the injured person, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not even noticed the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the commissioner in Stolzenau at Tel. 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
Author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to lead to discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche", after publication to the German press agency, said he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret for their own omissions or their misjudgment of the events at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized the fact that the reporting of violence among the cathedral sparrows is measured with "two degrees".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; but striking is the "degree of media manipulation", according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
“The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal,” Scaraffia writes.
In an interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said: "You like going to church and that is a found food."
She also pointed out that in her youth, "beating was a normal educational means to cope with naughty children, as I was one."
It would be unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who together with Ratzinger wrote the memory book "My Brother the Pope" (translated into 12 languages).
“I have to protect Georg Ratzinger,” says Hesemann, “because all this had nothing to do with him,” he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedrals were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 cathedrals were sexually abused.
The final report says about Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can be stated that Domkapellmeister R. has used forms of physical and psychological violence in many cases.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, it is noticeable that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him.
In an interview, Hesemann explains why he believes the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg cathedral sparrows relieves Georg Ratzinger.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence against guardians at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize his “humanity.”
On the other hand, he also appears as a cholericist and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a Domspatz did not perform top-notch musically.
How do you view this final report as his biographer?
Michael Hesemann: If you take the trouble and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is even found in it.
There are only eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity in the horrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence in preschool also occurred outside his sphere of influence.
You can at best accuse him of not knowing it too late or of not taking the first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "salvation", "heaven" and "better world".
For example, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, also exhibits an excellent testimony, describing him as "warmhearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "compassionate", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has also led to outbursts of anger.
That he not only banged with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also distributed ear figs and pulled too naughty guys on his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In his honor, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, among parents as well as teachers.
Do you know of such methods of discipline?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrible sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are, of course, bagatelles.
One wonders whether it has to do with his reputation and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed over to him.
Many people who have never understood the pope are still working hard on the Bavarian pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
Much has been reported in the media about the abuse of the Regensburg Domspatzen in connection with the report.
Is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
None of the 67 victims of sexual assault claim to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.
Not even the parents were involved.
“I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it,” one person said on behalf of the others, “I was all very embarrassed.”
The real problem with elucidating sexual abuse was and still is that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choirmaster, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a certain professional sense.
How do Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger’s role in the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: An interviewed student put it this way: "As to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which, of all things, he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I think it ... is also really absurd to assume that ... boys have been more insistent or clear or more open to him than to their parents, boarding directors, trust teachers, etc.
Talking to him about sex is unthinkable.”
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and/or their surroundings entrusted themselves to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger can therefore be acquitted of any co-awareness.
So he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to report.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these abominable crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot to read about "Gewaltexzessen" at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence, and, let’s say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choral director of the cathedral.
All the horrible beatings, the cases where boys were harassed and misrepresented by sadistic teachers and suffered appallingly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
One was just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different at Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that "many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases, despite violence, even associate positive memories with him".
At the most, the accusation remains to have looked away.
However, despite all the efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported on preschool conditions.
The first time in 1970/71, when he just started to establish himself and did not want to hear anything about the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible (so the witness) and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "in preschool the beating penalty will continue to be practiced".
Already in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beating penalties were long banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as we all know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can’t say he’d always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating penalty in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s pedagogical standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians speak of the “fall-trick of anachronism”, that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today’s moral standards.
The princess is right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abhorrent at all times, nor to what was done in preschool in terms of adversity and violence against innocent children’s souls, that goes far beyond what was usual at the time.
It’s all horrible and I’m glad it’s finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. pulling ear figs and on his hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his Regensburg era did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the issue of punishment also discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective that the Domsparts played only a secondary role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candies alone, you don’t make big singers out of rebellious boys and stand before every success, no matter what field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As what kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger in the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and have experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, generous, deeply believing and good-hearted person, who you can't imagine could do anything to even a fly.
I regularly get to see how many former catholic sparrows still keep in regular contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, visiting him, reading to him - he's almost blind - and treating him like a member of her family.
So those who have not forgiven him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and teaching them the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, for sure, that may be - but he was also a dearly respectful person to whom they still look up today and whom they worship.
And please, again, clearly: all he is accused of is educational methods that were common at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time a long time ago.
But it is highly unjust to turn a man into a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now the decency would be to leave a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, finally in peace.
