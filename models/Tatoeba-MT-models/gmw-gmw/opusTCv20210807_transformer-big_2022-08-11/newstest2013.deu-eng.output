A Republican Strategy to Face Obama’s Re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter to be a myth by reaffirming that election fraud is rarer in the U.S. than the number of people killed by the lightning strike.
Republican lawyers have reported only 300 electoral fraud cases in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for conducting elections in the individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of U.S. governments have been proposing new laws that make it more difficult to register or go through the urn.
This phenomenon has gained in importance following the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, restricting the exercise of suffrage in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election, and deny citizens the right to vote for which a court act is available.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana’s law in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states forcing voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency of their state.
In addition, five million new voters did not have such a card in 2012.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are to be paid to get the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID card.
This is far more than enough.
Students who are regarded as voters who vote increasingly for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state had requested proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
Because it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the democratic party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states promoted laws that abolished voter registration on election day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, campaigns to register voters in the 2004 general election helped to register about 10 million citizens.
Because of the measures adopted since 2009, the share of registration of new voters has decreased by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, although they account for only 13% of the state’s voters.
The same goes for the Hispanic people.
The latter represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, the whites, who represented 76% of the voters, made up only 46% of the voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passing of laws that restrict the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetos of democratic governors.
The US Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to limit the damage in part.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the passed laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing the results in the countries that are crucial for 2012.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that those states that passed these laws make up 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral board to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new regulations will have a negative impact on turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the democratic system of the United States.
Prostate cancer early detection: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test, in fact, sometimes has erroneous results, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This leads to a greater hesitation of the already undecided men for conducting early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We got the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the US, there were numerous interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret this data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, came to the conclusion that there is a difference in the mortality rate of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that with follow-up after 12 years, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 years, respectively, if you have a direct relative who already had prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk in African-American men.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer has been detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancers can remain untreated if they do not affect the quality of life in the long run, and in these cases, they are more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active monitoring and treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not be determined with increasing accuracy.
That is why I recommend doing the test.
But most importantly, talk to your doctor to determine whether or not it should be done.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that makes it possible to assess the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and exercised sufficiently.
“If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is assumed that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages people’s health.
“Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” the spokesman André Beaulieu regrets.
Encouraging data: 10 years after renouncing the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, intestinal, gastrointestinal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against bowel cancer throughout life," he adds.
The Diet
The organization also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of developing a grim or bowel cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salts can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body cells and lead to the development of cancer,” he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the relationship between vitamin additives and cancer.
Their investigations are not conclusive at the moment.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found the reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another was more likely to show an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family preoccupation.
"Performing an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Analyzing the Higgs boson
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson has caused some stir last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the standard model – our best or “least false” explanation of nature and the behavior of matter – but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it’s not completely certain that it’s really the Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still lacking to be absolutely sure about it.
Still, let’s assume that it’s actually the Higgs, as there seems to be only a small risk of being fooled, and let’s look at what it’s about.
There is an inevitable law in this world that prevents two objects from being in the same place at the same time.
It’s not possible to break this rule – and don’t try too hard as you’ll hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that a law of this kind also applies to it: the Paulian exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time when they are in the same "quantum state," whereby this "state" consists broadly of some of their properties.
On this basis, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens called Fermione, who kindly obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons move, an evil gang of anarchists, to whom nothing is sacred - in any case not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing by the way), are divided into two groups: the mesons that we will not treat here and the "power particles" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
However, it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of exceptional banality: the photon or the "light particle", which is the "bot" of electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" exactly at this location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More Stable Field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, a bit comparable to a frozen pond, whose surface could only be crushed by a very large rock.
Therefore, a huge particle accelerator such as CERN is required - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
It is indeed not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don’t – for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator on its own.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do have one mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What can all these researches be "good" for, Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow physicists to closely examine any deviations between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are numerous physicists who eagerly hope that such deviations will be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and stuff some holes of the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has major flaws, as it offers no explanation for gravity (up!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found in CERN.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is none.
By the way, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who in 1962 himself developed the first continuous-stroke laser (the first ones were pulsed) - has already told us that the laser was considered more of a "laboratory play" in the beginning.
Just imagine...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras worldwide and earned it the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die...
Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its committee on “dignified deaths.”
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the home for palliative care Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"However, it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table in front of a tasty lunch, he resigns to let himself be helped with food.
Courageously, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medications, and offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
“My greatest wish is to cure my diarrhea, as it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
“Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Going back to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the ability of the person to take a step back," he notes.
After all, according to several people who work in palliative care, large events take place in the midst of these regressions.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who take care of them.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “consciously and by suffocation.”
But because of the illness, I really got to know my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t have any wishes in life,” she says before accepting to put on a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she expects her son, who is from Italy, to visit her for the last time.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, a group of volunteers provides personal care and food intake assistance.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more enjoyable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for every 11,700 people.
That’s very little, considering that we’ll all die one day.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
Depending on the wishes of the dying person, oral care with brandy or Pepsi is granted.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help families and patients alike," reports care director Nathalie Savard.
In the home of Victor-Gadbois, no day is like the other.
Alongside an old man of 93 who enjoys the last family meeting in the yard and is well supported by his pillows while pushing in his honor, a young man of 36, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied with cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois’ home come from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when the latter reach the final stage of their lives, both at home, in the hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Society for Domestic Palliative Care in Montreal, are more or less specializing exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great inadequacy in Quebec’s health care that causes several palliative care specialists to face the adoption of a euthanasia and assisted suicide law with concerns.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation signed by prominent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that all have the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with great pain, without any measures being taken to alleviate her.
I fear that patients will die simply because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients bitterly until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
The chances of Hélène Richard’s survival were already minimal when she discontinued difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist I was going to stop the treatment, she replied that she regretted giving up the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not fulfilling this wish after their pain has been alleviated by a palliative care team.
However, it must be said clearly that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Society of Domestic Palliative Care in Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which means either sporadically or permanently sleeping the patient by the time he dies.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not alleviated all say the same sentence: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean, “I want you to put me to sleep,” but “I want my pain to be alleviated.”
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism scholarship from Canadian health research institutes.
Property scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, major construction companies, political party fundraisers, and Italian mafia specialists tell us every day what they know about a great “system” that entangles the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mafiosos.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec's taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s strange how the system has decayed since drastic measures were taken,” jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former head of police in Montreal.
The scandal was uncovered by him due to an in-depth investigation of the embezzlement related to the Quebec road works contracts, which the then prime minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he emphasizes, “the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in the contracts,” because some were curbing their instincts to keep their share!
The Charbonneau Commission “has already brought down two mayors,” he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in “showing the tactics behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops to accountants, investigators and analysts of the government.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau Force", which since 2009 has caused the "Canalization Cartel" of Montreal to proceed more cautiously in the artificial inflation of the treaties...
In the last few weeks, she has made several house searches and raised charges of fraud and corruption against municipal mandate holders such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from office as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
He is suspected of having received bribes repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
By the way, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Office, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were explicitly charged.
The latter has attracted attention by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the "system" for the receipt of public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to an intermediary associated with the Mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito played his part in the 2000s by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former liberal vice president Nathalie Normandeau.
sewerage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, as well as bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other road construction officials have admitted that they let themselves be lubricated by artificially inflating the bills with false extras by 30-40%.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first members of Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she rebelled from 2010 against the sale of a community property acquired for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million in builders in the booming real estate market.
70% of black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation, which is ultimately being conducted, she says it “draws on a thread that allows us to understand the functioning of the system infiltrated by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty.”
She says the procedure is "painful, but positive."
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but we need an investigative unit dedicated only to Montreal, as well as supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but he is especially concerned about the role of the "mandate holders who are in the picture about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting from a 70% black money share in funding the Quebec election campaigns, he jokes: “I was told that this was just a weak off-the-shelf of reality.”
The government of Quebec proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, which it says would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in circulation in politics."
He recommends a complete revision of the system for awarding public contracts and financing the parties: “We cannot fall deeper; by going to the bottom with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws.”
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh about it to take a look in their own backyard...
PSG is not Barcelona.
This season you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal insight, but also through the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
I make progress on their side every day.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me to improve my level of play every day.
In a game, this is even easier.
In football, everything goes very fast.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the center of the INF Clairefontaine preparatory training to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have progressed gradually.
They thus take advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new arrivals of this summer are used to playing at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to face up and wants to do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the task?
Of course.
Ancelotti pays tribute to all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on a rich experience and has won many titles with respected clubs.
He was in contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as the leader.
We are lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the eighth final in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have to speak against very good European teams.
First of all, we want to be the first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the back game of the eighth final as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a big European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means for this project to take on concrete forms.
Would it be a great failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as it was last season?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year it is really important for us to give up this title.
Last season we were close.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be a champion with 79 points.
But another team, that of Montpellier, has achieved an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even though the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are struggling for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win 4-0 in a home game against Troyes, and you still find something to blame, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people are expecting.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We try to create a game concept.
A team builds over time.
We have shown strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that hasn’t managed to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, and that has also made huge expenses!
In terms of the invested sums, you were believed to have a 15-point lead during the game break!
That would mean ignoring our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that we will be the smiling winner in the month of May and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG appears to be fully dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better to speak of a "Zlatan dependency".
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores a lot of goals.
That's why he came and he proves he's the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did was truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championship with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was important to me to take part in this event.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from taking out some playtime.
I have seen things that have strengthened me.
Today I manage to make good matches in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
From what happened in Ukraine, we have learned our lesson, and today we have to be exemplary.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and encourages them to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the draw enforced in Spain on October 16th a kick-off game?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has fought for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, designed by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol such as BitTorrent, which allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After reaching a high of $30 ($23) in June 2011, Bitcoin fell to $2 five months later, before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) showed interest in this in a report published in October on virtual currencies.
It describes Bitcoin as “the virtual currency with the greatest success”, “competing with the dollar or euro” and “similar to traditional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as the “credits” that are used to advance into a video game that you can win or buy through gaming (and sometimes also exchange).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and handled by a central authority every time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously custodians of the accounting book, auditors, money issuers, as well as buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data associated with this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoins are present in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unambiguous electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If one user wants to pay for cheating twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other will remain unlinked as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the task will receive 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are thus limited to 21 million, but can be shared up to a hundred millionth, which leaves some room for manoeuvre.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not concern the actual protocol,” assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real money payment company and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also shows these deficiencies.
Important actors such as Wikipedia deny donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a “mega-final sale” was launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that are cheaper as a result.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented on dealers, and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You just need to provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, Pierre Noizat specifies, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in rethinking hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontally aligned systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB’s report envisages a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be highly significant in the event of the success of this currency.
We moved out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the United States are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
In particular, we punished the Afghan peasants by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the wounded and devoured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse to have an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there as Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nylab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed by French loans, was properly carried out.
The trucks and tank convoys flown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of the Taliban into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, the conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was engulfed by war due to the struggles of the various insurrectionary groups.
Their seizure of power was then regarded as a kind of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to date.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have turned into merchants by confiscating government land to sell it as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of massive American subcontracting.
They have discredited themselves, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fights.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, just like those who have been able to make use of American subsidies: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one-fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series representing a modern world is watched everywhere.
There is an army now.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore militias in the province, who will evade the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization in the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which has existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzaï does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams do not exist and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruits and vegetables, nothing is produced.
The private initiative is given priority.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
Rumor has been spread that Afghanistan possesses immense mineral resources.
This adds to the impression that the Western countries were only there to take hold of it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for an export over the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, have the international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) do their excavations on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of traditional aids: girls' and boys' high schools, institute of French at universities, French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit work and measures for the restoration of agriculture in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "gain hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, for which numerous local workers were required, has been able to help suppress the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after military spending of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are often very hard in these valleys at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural projects from communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which, according to their own statements, is their wish, it would be necessary to continue to provide less, more well-controlled and directly related civilian aid in their favour.
A Constitution with a Breaking Bar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever regarding the Constitutional Declaration, which gives it temporary unrestricted power of attorney, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had granted this plenary two additional months for the completion of its work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a provisional, multi-modified text, which weakens institutional stability and leads to a legal mess.
This new initiative has only resulted in an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his “autocratic delirium” by “continuing to break his word” and “striking justice.”
Its supporters are assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time forcing the brothers to renounce their intention to explain the text section by section to the Egyptians.
For the president, it’s also a way to regain public and democratic legitimacy as protest rages across the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American newspaper Time, Mohammed Mursi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote benevolently.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum with this recourse to an overhaul vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I retain unlimited power", the latter should supposedly come to an end after the adoption of the constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this constitutional assembly passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals did not comply with the request.
Shortly before the constitutional declaration in mid-November, they turned away, believing that they were unable to express their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted equally.
In order to achieve decision-making capacity, 11 deputy members were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were usually passed unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only disagreement of the day... was expressed at the time of the prayer, as some members of the panel felt that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which attracted all attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that “the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice.”
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had the hope of replacing "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
The liberals, who see this only as a propaganda strike, respond with “hypocrisy.”
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place over other articles.
They have in particular in mind Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory function, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with the laws of Sharia law.
According to Egypt’s specialist Sophie Pommier, this is disturbing because “those who are asked to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also nurtured by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is currently no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most lawyers who have worked on this text are not ultemas, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system," says Alexis Blouet, who writes a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He acknowledges, however, that “there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
It refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic case law, note d.
And in the future, the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text passed yesterday is strongly criticized for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another issue is the power of the army.
In line with the military's wishes, the examination of the defence budget is presented not to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as demanded by the human rights associations.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The fact of blasphemy is maintained, and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, there is no longer an article about the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their view, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comfort and untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
bowing to the holy places,
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God’s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, feeding the sea storm and fishing.
This is where Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries are in Jerusalem.
Believers here commit the Passion or Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The trail starts at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the tomb church on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands at the place where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews - the wall of lamentation, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 A.D.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave papers with wishes that are then fulfilled.
Take a trip upstairs
The ruins of the fortress of Massada form the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They lie on a rock wall in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins on their own.
All the others take an aerial cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at 1600 to 2040 meters altitude is the famous ski resort Hermon, in which it attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain you can get there by shuttle bus.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountaintop.
Visit Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
With only one trip, not all of them can be visited.
But at least the five most interesting ones should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum, not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
There, ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea Scrolls found in rock caves in the Judean desert are kept, as well as about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
There, the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited.
In Akko you can visit the Museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Entry is free and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most poignant section is the memorial to the children, which was built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars are sparkling.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for health
The three main recreational areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, the Red Sea also bathes in the winter months, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 °C and the air warms to 23 °C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there is bathing all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea, with a location of 417 meters below sea level, is the lowest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salt content and therefore even carries non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural salt brine) and curative mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm stressed nerves.
Touching the Secrets of Antiquity
These secrets are kept in the old town of Tel Aviv, the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through this city went the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after zodiac signs.
According to legend, Fortuna is held by all who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries at photo appointments.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city of Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre nowadays hosts evening concerts and operas.
Favourite list for tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your poor English skills: About 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is preferable not in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get on by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a highway and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city to the upper city.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is sufficient for a trip of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transport rests.
And on Sunday morning the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and restaurants, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without shed, and food that contains both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice of different dishes with hemp and beef, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls made from pureed beans and peas (falpo), as well as fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
There are many well-fed cats who stroll comfortably and unhurtled through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don’t say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets for museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the visa requirement was lifted on 9 February 2011.
‘The Great and the Powerful’ Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money for Language
While MPs and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading with fake certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money for the livelihoods of the families left in the home.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every worker to take a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail sector.
However, in the future, according to the Federal Migration Authority, the tests should be mandatory for all guest workers.
In doing so, you need to take not only language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be proven for both obtaining and extending work permits.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Excluded from this Act are persons who received their certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problem and protection of rights
The entire body will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities; already more than 160 corresponding centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times before the law entered into force in the press: What does it actually mean?
What changes does the requirement to have language skills bring, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
Above all, responding spokespersons of the Migration Authority, are concerned with reducing the number of forced labourers.
“Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers,” said Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems encounter migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical assessment.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who will put him under the pretext of help in a dark, narrow barracks, where he will endure with dozens of months without food and documents and will work 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“At home, you are promised the One, and upon arrival you will be cheated, get their passports taken, and not receive the promised wage,” confirms the head of the Central Administration for Labour Migration of the Tajik Migration Authority, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't scream, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics, who want to make their money in Russia, admit that they not only do not know the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault, but rather the evil: only a few Turkmens, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford a reasonable elementary education.
For in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As a teenager, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "Prohibited Access for Unauthorized Persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that most of our documents are fake and we are not registered, and this results in cases of blackmail.
“They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea,” Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
“Don’t worry about the cost of wrong papers.”
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of the migrants can be fake.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Authority.
The fake papers were printed with an ordinary color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive it for nothing: every migrant who hoped to be able to spare himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a worker three thousand rubles.
The fact that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates can not be bought simply, both officials and civil rights activists agree.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fall through the test the first time that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Home Office ignores illegal arms market
Proportion of legal weapons in crimes extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry is planning to tighten the gun law for private gun owners.
The authorities are responding to the recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and promised that the amendments to the Arms Act will be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter has been published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms associations - call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very small, said Criminal Justice, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes with the use of the registered weapons were committed over the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that a tightening of the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using themselves on the black market.
At present, according to the authors, you can find any weapon in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market through several channels.
There are five such major channels, says a former Colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” Baranez said.
On the second channel are illegal weapons, which are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen from both the police’s armoury and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military weapons warehouses.
Many military camps have been subject to explosions.
“There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the absence of weapons,” the former military member said.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers are also making a contribution to the black market.
“Today, there are countless private arms factories that do not withstand international competition and therefore squander the weapons under hand on the black market, for example in Moscow,” the expert reports.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is its own production, sometimes craftsmanship, as well as a mafia that organizes the smuggling," explains the former military member.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was written by the Center for Problem Analysis and Government Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on the subject of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and legal authorities.
“Half of all weapons on the black market came through the debt of those in charge who are involved in their work with weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict areas, 14% from thefts in weapons production, and 5% from illegal excavations.
A gun shop sales consultant who doesn’t want to be named assures that guns found in illegal excavations have long since been outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to get the supplies in a weapons warehouse.
A gun, for example, a type TT, is purchased via an ensign.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
“The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros each with two magazines,” he says.
“Of course, the police know everything and therefore, if they can’t comply with the crime detection plan, periodically make control purchases from merchants who offer illegal weapons,” the sales consultant adds.
"Like in the luxury store"
Buyers and sellers usually find out about acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I come to Begowaja station, where a person would wait for me to bring me to a certain place, where we could negotiate the price.
I only learned the price of the gun there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him."
There are dealers in the markets, but there you have to go and meet up with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who tells you that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even coming to a few rings of blows about a friend I trust.
He also gives me the rings because he knows I'm not whipping him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military member Viktor Baranez tried himself in the mid-1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He got a photo album in which “everything” was depicted.
“I felt like I was in the luxury store,” recalls the military member.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set a target.
“I can then shoot there, and if I’m convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we’ll negotiate with each other,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results to websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
No papers are needed, nor are there any personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a fight gun or rifle".
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also being sold to minors?
"Of course without license," asks user "Iwan" (literal quotation).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request from "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are flocking to the service.
People come like hungry fish at feeding and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The responsible parties accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the non-profit organization Pravo na oryzhie.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also go out empty and get behind bars when you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to purchase weapons are flocking to the service.
“People come like hungry fish at feeding and then end up in the Siberian labor camp and are allowed to shovel coal,” he says.
A Makarow for $100
According to experts, when buying illegal firearms, prices are expected to range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a gun of the type Makarov for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by middle-class guards.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, the number of illegal weapons crimes across Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of cases of theft and blackmail related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, fast-food and supermarket workers strike
One in four U.S. teenagers will be sitting behind Mc Donald's cashier at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the U.S. against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as Mc Donald’s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy’s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell or whether they will soon be out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing nonprofits.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast-food workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of founding unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organised as a trade union.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on what is known as Black Friday, when sales took place in the United States that attracted millions of customers, which sometimes led to handcuffs.
On this day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their work and, along with trade unions and left activists, targeted branches of the chain that target people with low and medium incomes.
Walmart sells all products, from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in the Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of the slightly paid Walmart employees only shop at their own workplace.
The prices and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell the goods only because the employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, for example missing forklifts or hand-held scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests demanded wage increases and expressed their anger over the fact that the contribution to the company’s health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 an hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers at Berkeley University in California have found that if the company raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they're donating for wages now.
If Walmart fully transferred the wage increases to the customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
That would be $12.39 per year compared to today.
Proponents of Walmart are pleased to note that protests only occurred in nine states and did not result in any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted in his store from 8 a.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
All in all, the Walmart cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees were laying down the work and the protest action was merely “another PR trick” of the union organizing the protests.
"Free Cash!"
Protests continued in New York this week, but their target was not Walmart stores (which are undesirable in this progressive city and therefore so far inexistent), but McDonald’s and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald’s says the company sells billions of portions, and yet you’re not given sick days, and you’re not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York law is $7.25 an hour.
In fast food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually raised, but not too much, and on average their simple employees in New York get $8.90 an hour.
No one deserves less than her in this expensive city.
How it is possible to get along with so little money in New York is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all U.S. teenagers stood behind the counter at McDonald’s after school, but the teenagers were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald’s employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to get along with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a commentary in the Wall Street Journal forum whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know how to feed them.
Participants of the protests, which began Thursday at 6:30 a.m. in front of McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs from fast-food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, which is more than a doubling of the current minimum wage.
They continued to demand the formation of trade unions in the fast-food industry.
The U.S. law forbids corporate management to stand in the way of this goal and to exhort or dismiss union members.
On the other hand, the management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast-food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Dissatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the protests was a midday meeting in front of McDonald’s in Times Square where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald’s says it sells billions of portions, and yet you are not granted sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!”
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that “we should support the fast food workers together so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!”
According to the New York Times, this was the biggest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred local people, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, where tens of thousands work in New York.
It is not yet to be seen whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
“The brain has only been moderately overwhelmed so far.”
The topic of extended reality, popular with fans of modern technologies, has recently been perceived by the lens of special glasses.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
However, in conversation with the head of the group for interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft lab in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company’s scientists.
It excites the ability to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
Please briefly describe what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, most of humanity has been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens that are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look ahead 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are an advancement, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What do we expect in the future?
Although Kinect has taken the interaction to a physical level, a lot is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output has not yet been decisive.
We are trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, it is necessary for this to be recognized not only the user, but also his environment.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much easier.
And first of all, we should get rid of these silly virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s popular, but isn’t it overrated?
- It is certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around you about your actions and intentions.
Actually, every type of interaction with computers is good, but each one in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public spaces, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and concise gestures instead of expansive gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, for example gestures and language.
- How so?
- For example, we'd ask you to give me this squeaky box?
They say it and point it out at the same time.
- Normally I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot do at the time?
- Not necessarily, but this is about a mutual rapprochement.
I think we will have to work on developing new types of sensors in the near future, which will allow us to capture people’s reactions more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, because they offer a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
What are your demands based on your work with Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is it lacking in resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X- and Y-axis, but also along the Z-axis must be taken into account.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond lab with a controllable processing delay of 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today’s commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used for calculating the depth of the object.
More cameras may be able to solve the problem.
Or amplify the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system in which we could play with different camera inclinations to see how this helps us in determining a three-dimensional position.
If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that glasses have the best prospects in terms of applying the technology of extended reality in everyday life?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always hold a smartphone in your raised hand on the go, but I think the best option would be a "changing" extended reality, in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and that is their strength (only you can see them), but at the same time their weakness, because an extended reality with glasses prevents you from working together on virtual objects.
Let’s imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to normal mortals.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
Your hands don’t feel anything!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that the extended reality represents the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection material.
She feels the pressure very well!
However, there are also technologies that are actually geared towards giving the "images in the air" some hand-fastness, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is located, creates a feeling that is still as weak as someone pushed over the palms at the moment.
There are also ligaments for the wrist that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, also this is a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
Make it think that it feels what it should feel when it is seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried yet.
Here is another task that we will have to struggle with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed room believe he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), moving platforms, and large spheres.
So far, the brain is only moderately overwhelmed, and there are still many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: For many topics, we are only at the beginning.
Personal taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburger Avantgarde", dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
Already on the select list were high-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes go beyond the boundaries of the city and are often recognized in Europe, without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bear dressed in red, which can be found at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at vernissagen.
Wherever the pictures of Kirill Miller are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg socio-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous figure of the Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and, through his presence on the street, conjures a smile on the face of his fellow citizens and makes them feel good.
Recently he grabbed a rotating organ and became a Petersburg rotating organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artist life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer that deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the grey standard provokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to a conversation.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace where my works were exhibited.
I realized that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, i.e. with the representatives of the "Gazonevchina"; from this "Pushkinskaya 10" emerged, and then it was all over.
I am attracted to theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything but literature.
It was important to me to be at the center of the Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists were supposed to gather.
In 1995 I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemia, the house of the Petersburg Bohemia, until the renovation work.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how string got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys and included the contemporary composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origins in the art clinic.
Our staff and regular guests went there.
I’m a hero of the past century, when culture meant something.
In 2000 there was a survey in the press, which was about the award "personalities of our city".
I won in the Artist of the Year category, and I was at my peak.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have a distinctive style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be like that.
In a clown, it all fades away and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let’s save the world by dictating that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients themselves to the exterior and not to the interior of man.
But maybe you shouldn’t give a person a hand, but spit him in the face.
The deception disappears by dressing up.
- Recently, we saw you in the role of the urban rotating organist.
Who, if not me?
Can commercial art be beautiful?
Nowadays, commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: the bohemians loved the one and the simple people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- To Stas Michailov's performances come several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money, and everything goes to ruin.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to cheat them and not to destroy what they have achieved.
In my youth, I painted such paintings that even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually only come at the end of the career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that’s something completely different.
I am a person of past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to be able to paint.
This is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what's missing in Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
It is said to be a servant of culture.
However, not all of them can relate to culture.
The real czars were different, because the czars might not understand much about culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some that could be experts, but they are blocked by the need for higher-level experts to properly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now only your own taste counts.
The same applies to the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not all accept contemporary art and that some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; in Moscow there is much more culture and a corresponding breeding ground.
On our stones, art can grow hard.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, it is much less.
Art must be modern again, just as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the city of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killerasteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earth inhabitants on board set out to find a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question arises as to how we can reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
“That’s Mars and Venus,” says a researcher at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute, Vladimir Surdin.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The researchers first discussed the question of reproduction in space with regard to the flora.
Half a century earlier, experiments with plants were carried out.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit differed in no way from the earthly species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more precisely tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to explore how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It develops into a normal chick.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a hold; it has to be able to stand on its feet and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute of Medical Biological Problems RAN, Vladimir Sychew.
Without a solid surface, the chicks overlap wildly.
Ten hours later, the newborn’s instincts completely blew off.
The chicks did not respond to light and loudness.
Four days later, they simply died.
“Twice we let chicks hatch and then set the whole thing up because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” Vladimir Sychew says of the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, there will only be same-sex species on the biosatellite "Bion".
There was an experiment with rats that were already sent fertilized into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to continue," notes Vladimir Sychew.
After the landing, the space rats got offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn out of their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive drive.
Unlike animals, humans can do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was in Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing humanity has is the female organism.
Our gull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the question: Does it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"Ultimately, no one answered that question," says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was twice in orbit and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts who went well after long flights and had healthy offspring.
“The more, the more dangerous it is even on flights into orbit,” concludes Cosmonaut Waleri Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet humanity must look for new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the production of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolabor at the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a compulsory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a suspended state, the cosmonauts gain routine for working in open space.
Water represents weightlessness.
Even though adults find water pleasant, it is a strange environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little Ichtyanders were witnessing that life on land escaped from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the mother's abdomen in amniotic fluid for about 9 months, and the fact that then it is easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since only 2 weeks go by from birth until the first swim.
“This is not enough time to forget something,” says baby swimming teacher Marina Aksenowa.
While for a newborn child weightlessness is a much more natural condition, the woman does not do without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles regress enormously quickly and thus also the ability to squeeze the child out decreases.
All right, let's bypass this by birth-initiating aids.
The birth could also take place in a special chamber, for example, to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the draught, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a stress suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is fundamental to his life.
“This experiment, which we are doing together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled, a completely unadjusted person,” predicts RAN’s head of the Bioethics Commission.
So far, the birth of children in space is only theory.
At some point, however, it becomes a reality when the Earth’s inhabitants embark on their spaceships to become a distant planet that will be home to their space-born offspring.
NKA Chief: Control of the Black System Fails due to Politics
The Czech Republic has good supervisory authorities and adequate laws in relation to public procurement, but it is not applicable.
This is what the Vice President of the Supreme Control Office, Miloslav Kala, said in an interview for Aktuáln.cz.
“A law is never perfect, but it needs to be applied correctly – and I don’t think that’s the case with us,” Kala said.
A similar result appears to be a joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cited the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Necas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls – so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the government chairman, and the control office, whose duty now is to check compliance with the law, hinders its activities," Kala notes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint Czech-German project, in which the laws of both countries regarding public procurement were compared.
What was it about in concrete terms?
This is a parallel test that we started about two years ago.
Put simply, it is a matter of the European legislature defining how public procurement should be handled, which is what national legislation is based on, and finally, the actual practical application.
We have compared all of this, and although the examination is not yet complete, we were able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws in us may be even a little "stricter and more perfect", but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to draw up new and more precise rules over and over again, and it is also necessary to look at the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What results for you from this project?
It is precisely such a common control that could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect laws and lower and balance thresholds if this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering thresholds for orders does not guarantee that we will also achieve this goal.
Perhaps it is even the case that this is how we only burden the system with excessive “paper stuff,” and those who are looking for gaps in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
They talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech Procurement Act.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NK, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German counterpart to the NK is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a college that is only formed slightly differently.
The competencies are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. these accounting bodies also exist in the individual federal states - in this the German system differs from ours.
The BRH can only control federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which are managed by the districts and municipalities, are subject to the control of the regional accounting authorities.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it easier than ours?
Nevertheless, in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, although one certainly cannot say that Germany is better in everything.
Is it because the examiners are better?
That certainly isn’t, but as I said, I don’t like comparisons like that much.
In this regard, it should also be noted that those countries that are an example for us are also struggling with problems.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have any cooperation with our authority, would you?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did the amendment of the Procurement Act have for your authority, do you already feel any impact?
Given that this novel is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an effect on our examinations.
Since our checks take place afterwards, we have to expect a certain delay here.
So far, we are more likely to experience effects in the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we have introduced the new control tool "Recognition of risks of inefficiencies" and with this almost 14,000 public contracts are reviewed and analyzed - here, of course, the changes will have an effect, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among other things.
Do you see the adoption of this law rather positively, or is the system burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, there may be the problem that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be complied with.
Already under the previous rules, the persons subject to an examination are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the effect that any non-compliance with the Procurement Act is equivalent to a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have committed a form error that does not affect actual decision-making.
Such a system only puts the bureaucracy under even greater pressure.
Where's the way out?
First, let’s say which path is not goal-oriented.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called “black system” – what exactly does that mean?
Is the Black System Prohibited or Allowed?
A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then it cannot simply come to the head of the government, and the control office, whose duty is to check compliance with the law, can hinder its activities.
He can say, “We change the law and allow the thing,” but he can’t say that we act as if nothing were.
The Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely because of shape defects.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be properly applied - and that is what I think we lack.
On the roads there is occasionally ice smoothness, but mostly they are dry.
On the roads of the Czech Republic there is some snow and ice smoothness.
Mostly, however, the roads are easy to navigate, sometimes more caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were easily accessible this morning, and occasionally there was snow and ice smoothness.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 °C, during the day it should be a little warmer.
In the region it no longer snows, and in the lower altitudes only a thin snow cover remains.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the district road guard, there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 highway and the first-class roads in the region are currently unrestricted.
However, attention is paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes paved and smooth.
All roads of the second and third class, including the mountain roads, are also accessible.
On these roads, however, snow remains in sections.
Increased attention is therefore required in particular in the higher layers.
Districts Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger of ice smoothness, in higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes an extended layer of snow on the roads, the road and motorway directorate informs on its websites.
The road masteries warn drivers of ice smoothness, which can occur in particular at higher altitudes in the Pardubice district.
Ice smoothness can be reached especially on second and third class roads in the districts of Lanskroun, Ostá nad Orlicá, Polika, Svitavy and Vysoké Máto.
Roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and in the Orlické hory Mountains.
An extended layer of snow lies at altitudes on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Knonou and Trutnov.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or cheerful, and it remains largely rainless.
Temperatures range between -3 and +1 °C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen County
The roads in the district of Pilsen are easy to navigate today, but local attention is required, and the driving style is adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it snowed before and the temperatures then dropped, ice smoothing can occur on the roads.
Local fog is also expected, but the visibility will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the district road masteries.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but the road masteries recommend increased attention between the 80th and 131th kilometers.
The roads of the first class are predominantly dry, but frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, however, ice smoothness can occur in sections.
The second and third class roads are humid, and therefore the reference to possible frozen sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Today, riders who are heading towards the altitudes in the Olomouc district have to count on snowmatch.
After the use of scattered vehicles, snowmatch stays on the pass "ervenohorské sedlo" as well as on the road towards Videlská.
The road masteries were forced to use snow at night, and according to the road administration, about 3 cm of fresh snow fell in the district of Umperk.
In the other areas of the district, the roads are usually unrestricted.
"In the circle of 'umperk there are still snow remnants in the altitudes.
“On the pass “Ervenohorské sedlo, the riders have to expect snowmatch in the direction of Jesenik,” a road administrator told the agency “TK”.
Her colleagues in the Jesenik district also had to get out at night, according to their information, the roads are free and wet to the altitudes after chemical treatment.
In the Olomouc district, the roads are fully accessible, but in the Eternberk district, the drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads are still humid.
Nad Labem District, Liberec District
In northern Bohemia, the road masteries report several poorly navigable road sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice smoothness, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice is blocked in the district of St.K. according to the traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero even in deeper locations, so that snow and ice will stay on the roads. From the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, no problems are reported, and the roads are usually dry there.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice smoothness is reported, in particular, from around the region.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night cloudless sky and frost.
Poor traffic conditions are reported from the main routes as well as from the road I/13 at the border of the districts of .st. n.L. and Liberec.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knanice was necessary due to branches that were pressed from the snow load to the road.
Simon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think is the end of the world in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that we people like to jump on.
With our band The Tap Tap, we’re more likely to make fun of it and say that we’re the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a national benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
For this purpose, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is projected to end on December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a time zone of 12 hours ahead of us.
From whom does this idea come?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic artist Honza Augusta.
In doing so, we not only want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we once handed this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key rings against the end of the world, with which people can also support us through their purchase via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also recorded the so-called anthem against the end of the world with the title "Weltuntergang fällt aus".
Already today the anthem is very popular on YouTube. Will it also sound on the beneficiary concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The anthem will be sung by all performers at all three concerts at the same time.
In addition, the anthems are broadcast live together in a direct connection from Czech television.
The lyrics of the anthem are by Tomás Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, also sings Xindl X with...
How did you come to cooperate with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we realize many beneficiary events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational center Studeo, on which we have been working for six years together with the association Tap in the Jedlica Institute.
The students of the Jedliáka Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the editors, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlicka Institute, a separate building is to be built, in which we will move in with this project.
There are several groups and performers at each concert.
What criteria did you choose?
We wanted to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbian, Illustratosphere perform with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jia Suchi.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar “big events” planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests for this concert.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - if we are in the USA - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, so far you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be transported in the luggage compartment. In addition, of course, we have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nonetheless, it has always worked without problems so far, SA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us that I sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your travel abroad you have a comparison of what it looks like in the individual countries with accessibility, how to deal with disabled people there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than we did, we witnessed in Russia that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible to disabled people, and it is still unusual when someone is in a wheelchair alone in the city center.
It is not even self-evident that you leave a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what ways do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're stuck in...
In addition, however, it should be noted that an improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public spaces, go to the museum, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not customary for a larger group of disabled people to actively participate in social events, in which we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in public and accessibility is one thing, but it’s only when our ranks come from significant athletes, artists, actors, politicians, or lawyers that things will really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a caregiver at the Jedlicka Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and play saxophone, among other things, I founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, La Angelovic, tends to say, this is something out of control (laughs).
But the band has only been known in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us; we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and this is not visible to the outside, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good editors, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to get it that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
Of course, the first impression that the viewer usually has is compassion; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the necessary means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities do something, it is not just a step forward for them, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise in many things and also have to demand a certain discipline.
However, I think this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they find that they have to rehearse twice a week, have to complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm for many quickly fades away.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
There is only one: La Angelovic.
We're an open group. People come and go. You can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 9 pm
Venues are: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues are finally connected via live circuits and a common interpretation of the band’s anthem “Weltuntergang fällt aus” is resounding.
The aim of the concert is to raise the funds for the provision of a multifunctional handicapped education centre, which is to be created under the name STUDEO at the Jedlica Institute in Prague.
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years are free, tickets are available in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the Space Agency at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency, making Poland the second member of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland’s journey into space began much earlier.
Before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were already involved in space travel, but they did not always come across understanding.
I recall here, for example, the lecture by A. Eternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entry to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience cold, and after years, Eternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934, he won the Prix REP-Hirsch, sponsored by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
In Polish magazines he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski’s globally recognized contribution to the development of space was honoured, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway train was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used for starting or braking the drain.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with missile-powered missiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents handed down that the research had progressed to the stage of practical tests.
The research was then interrupted, of course, by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a photoelectric hunting rocket was drafted by Ing. Rohoziski, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated from the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Agency (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this society is made in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to found a space company.
At the time, there were already the first satellite engineering projects, and it was foreseeable that space exploration would have a future.
In its early years in 1956, the Polish Space Agency (PTA) sought to join the International Federation of Space, founded in 1951, and in fact, the PTA became a regular member in the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Deputy Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed not quite 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959, flight tests began with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was discontinued.
The successor to the first RM rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
This rocket developed three types (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) that differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B over 0.34 liters and Meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight height for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aerospace Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a starting weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
After that, the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
Also worth mentioning is Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on charitable work.
This decision sparked a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberally oriented economic systems in the EU and in the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of work (wages), price tensions arise.
This term is understood to mean a condition in which the manufacturer tries to persist in economic competition by importing favourable goods by "undercuting" competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase his profit.
On a large scale, this means that most companies move their production abroad, buy it cheaply, or abandon their business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparable labour costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the overall economic and social damage caused by them.
This situation is well known, so that specific statistics are superfluous at this point.
The reckless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments are surrendering their own populations to private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is particularly reflected in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictate of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand by the restriction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as increasing differences between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food delivery offices for the poor for several years, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases where workers receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their incomes to the minimum of existence.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of auxiliaries employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of practically all the southern EU countries will undoubtedly result in the same state where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic fall of their social level (as was the case in the 19th century) or to offer a famine wage on the margins of society, hoping that someday private capital will flow into the country.
This naturally raises the question, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or the capital remains the same, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or in Africa at all, the workers work for a fraction of the European wages.
This concerns all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the point that the state cannot participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists tightly on its position that the state must not intervene in the economy in a directing manner.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct the politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a practically omnipotent lobby that is ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual bias, a legislation in which practically everything is punishable, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that due to a lack of finance, a state ministry entrusts private legal companies closely intertwined with industry with drafting legislation.
These bills will then be passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer proceeds from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently, the liberal democracies are now quickly coming into a situation as described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompeius: "The state has long been in disintegration, and the offices have been occupied by force.
For bribes, by illegal conspiracy of advantages, or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unrestrained, and the people went to the polls with already bought votes" ... "People with character did not apply for office, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline" ... "It was already really talked about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was a sole domination, and that a strong man had to be elected by the C-dominant"... Appian thought of it.
As it turns out, today’s society, as in antiquity, is based on the reckless preference of one’s own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital, by its very nature, is not able to recognize and enforce the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, today and then, is an unprecedented decadence of the elites, who are not at all striving for deeper reforms.
The cause of the advent of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the reckless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today’s standpoint, the downfall of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, with the next round already looming.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that today’s elites are in complete ignorance of the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know it from older and more recent history.
The repeal of the law on charitable work is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under pressure from global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the state’s participation in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Labor of Chaos.
"...that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is: "...so that we do not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want war, there wouldn’t be,” says the dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there were, as always, countless reactions.
Some support Israel and argue with its right to self-defense while calling the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide perpetrated on the Palestinian Arabs, and refer to the State of Israel as terrorist.
I do not want to write at this point about who is the culprit in these recurring waves of killing and who is the victim; in the end, today’s inhabitants of Israel, including the self-government areas, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the onset of violence itself.
I want to give readers a look behind the scenes, a look at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are especially helpful to.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and come from my own understanding of who or what group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can identify an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not arise within the life span of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be described as the head of the octopus (I don’t know if anyone else is standing over them, but I don’t rule this out) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the 90s of the 19th century to stop the connection of their name with highly criminal acts, in whose background always stood the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all central banks in the world, and against the countries where they are not involved in the central banks, they are waging wars or arming themselves on them (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Ghaddafi only four remained, with Russia in the meantime subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay for it with his life.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as a central bank, began to issue his own banknotes during the Civil War, and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the Fed for triggering the 1929 global economic crisis.
The Rothschilds’ global desire for power led in 1859-1871 to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break Britain’s colonial rule in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world’s population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would provide for their conveniences and luxury and not consume as many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism here is nothing more than the forefront) and finally lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of wealthiest families works with the Rothschilds at the forefront is the initiation of a crisis and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab chao – order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After they succeeded in triggering the First World War by the murder of the Habsburg successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsar empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier, the bankers allowed politics to create a latent conflict situation by putting Germany on gigantic war repairs; thereby they created the prerequisite for impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer on the Germans a sufficiently strong leader, who was to name the guilty and offer simple solutions; another factor was the creation of a multi-population state with a strong Czechoslovak minority.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, if possible in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, already mentioned, created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were first clashes with the resident Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War erupted, and whether Hitler now broke away from the chain at which the international bankers had initially held him, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as war repairs against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel constitutes the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will fall victim to the front line, this time along with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only in the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply the people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, with in the beginning the greed of individuals and their pursuit of global power?
It is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leadership, since the international bankers in Israel, as well as the people, elect only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist, loyal politician who does everything to spark a war with Iran, who, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could rapidly expand to a global conflict over the global economy, and in which it could only be due to the widespread destruction of Iran.
David Rockefeller's 1994 words: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the New World Order."
In their imagination, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which each newborn is implanted at birth to subject this being to total control.
And it makes that the little ones and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants all give themselves a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, that no one can buy or sell, but he has the mark, namely the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Whoever has understanding considers the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six.
The movie Argo: When it's worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled to the United States after the revolution, who had kept the patronage over his regime for decades.
There was no positive way out of this situation for the American government – it could not afford to throw the shah overboard as it would have massively damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, she was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent fiasco in the violent attempt at hostage liberation only made things worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days after negotiations had been mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages evoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The debacle in Iran contributed significantly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helping them cover up an extravagant story of their true identity - they traveled in disguise with Canadian passports as members of a film staff that allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by the expert on "exfiltration", Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
To make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in professional magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production society had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time. The film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, he is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful Husar piece such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This alternates the mood levels in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no major differences).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which come ironically and slightly over spit.
And then there are the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, in the corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable new start to his career with this film.
A smiling actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime film No Child's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller Stadt ohne Gnade (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film, which does not play in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the features that set this director’s previous films apart from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also demonstrates this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the initial sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when history moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong film rod on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
With the few, however, he works quite successfully, sometimes helping the reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted by a phone call in America, or also the pursuit on the runway, seem somewhat artfully).
The weakness of Argo is its all-too-wide dispersion, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters would have earned more space, and so they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck’s film loses some traction, and it’s a film that you can watch with some interest while guating the design and the 70-year-old thriller style.
But the excitement is hard to arouse.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that has been alive in some way to this day, and as proof of the extent to which the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services are overshadowed.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually launches a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has decided this year to host the competition "Absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
“This was the idea we came up with from the EU’s recent plan to introduce a 40% women’s rate in the management of large European companies,” Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising this survey, told Právo newspaper.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the judgment of the European Court of Justice on the standardisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively pose a lower risk for the insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote will take place until the end of February 2013,” said Nacher.
Controversial EU regulations include, among other things, the binding addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is therefore harmful to nature, and the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, or also the directive on the size of chicken cages, because eggs became significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism in the past also reaped the factual ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of this or that lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks with a veto threat).
Lobby interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not have a "curvature anomaly".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it would harmonize only the disparate national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU has already softened the standards for fruit and vegetables against the resistance of some countries by pointing out that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
One candidate for victory in this survey may be last year’s EU regulation, which, according to balloons on sale, must be notified that children under the age of eight are not allowed to inflate the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU relied on an American study which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of child suffocation death.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fairground toads.
There are also strange ideas at home.
Relatively absurd is also a directive that concerns European officials themselves - anyone who takes an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue to Greece and must instead say FYROM (former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, Laissez Faire nominated the server for the above-mentioned absurdities as well as the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the area of a member state.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food supplies that was allowed to be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the set volume for mushroom cans, for which we were threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for having no sea, or by the idea of granting grants for applications for grants.
Of course, these ideas did not come from Brussels, but from Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we have no sea.
We will apply for reimbursement from the EU," said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas, in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he argued that the grain harvest was very high and that the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally responded to the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development (Minister for Regional Development) under the direction of Minister Pavel Nimec (US-DEU) offered funding for applications for grants to the municipalities.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily targeted in the Member States, some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to improve the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition.
In the opinion of these experts, a more serious problem is the EU funding for projects that have nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which have been forced by individual Member States during budget negotiations.
Emotions also evoke the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states in Brussels, has to fight for the right to use specific names of traditional products and does not always win.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvaráky", the "Inländerrum" (Tuzemská rum), whose tradition dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
The name rum may only be used for products from sugar cane distillate, not for products from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the company of the world-famous cheeses Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübeck Marzipan or the Parma ham now also shows the Karlsbad Zwieback, carp from Poho'elice and T'ebo', or the Saazer hops.
With an EU brand, the Pardubice gingerbread or the Hocicer rolls can boo themselves.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
It’s not about being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I wouldn’t run anywhere.
But I can’t see the Republic being plundered for 20 years, thieves running around freely, while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I’m over 40, and I’m independent and impartial, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of a senator or the president.
You made it to the Senate and then made your way to the castle.
Don’t you turn your back on your voters?
I've been telling myself all the time that I'm going to start the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later, I made this clear and said that I would run for the office of president if I was elected Senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence as possible and a mandate as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people in the pub and in front of the TV, are scolding, but that we are crushing anyone who wants to change something.
In addition, there are the media who want to rob you of honor and who confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed about me that I was going to bribe journalists or that I was a consultant to Jia Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have taken up the battle for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retrospective declarations of assets over 20 million crowns.
You need to change laws.
As president, you have no powers in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have been committed to ensuring that the travel guide remains a free trade, and this could be enforced.
The problem is petty-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent partyless person, I have far greater potential to gain support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without drawer thinking and party dogma, I can take from any party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a political person on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are more likely to see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
It is important to me that we move forward.
I don’t care if anyone belongs to the left or to the right camp; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSM or the ODS, and so I will turn against bad ideas.
You don’t like someone calling you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to approach that.
This can be called populism for my sake, but all the proposals I have spoken of are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you only have keywords.
In the long term, this will not get you far in politics.
Or do you think that if you only talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
Persuade politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them to our side to achieve these goals.
As president, it would not be a problem for me to ask the chairmen of parliamentary parties live on television to enshrin material and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors by law.
And the people who spoke would have to say why they refused.
A strong personality that points to misconduct can put pressure on the political scene.
Take only once the direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I’ve just started politics and I’m trying to find the majority support for my program.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, then I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
That sounds a bit like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can’t achieve anything on my own, so I’ve talked to several well-known personalities about whether they don’t want to run for the Senate as well.
For example, I spoke with Radim Januura, who refused because of work congestion.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who revealed the fraud in the trade of light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy with the premise that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I’m not sure anymore.
Sixty percent of the eligible voters did not go to the elections at all, and those who left mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district chiefs.
Are you thinking about setting up your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet, because I don't have time to review the past of every potential party member, and I don't have the money for it at all.
I don’t even have money for the presidential campaign; in my transparent account there are only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about wealth declarations, what would yours look like?
I estimate my personal assets at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a plot worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, and a superb worth about a million, and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - James Bond always liked how he was riding in the car, gallant to women and at the same time fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don’t have money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I make a debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn’t attract too much interest.
And I am not obliged to run the campaign by my own means.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So, do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to have your income?
Didn't you say you're going to retrace these activities?
But this is not related to the salary.
As promised, I’ve partially slowed down my activities.
So, for example, my deputy will be managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
As President, however, I would completely discontinue my activities.
The full discussion can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby large company, says: "Well, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes voluntarily to one of these old-style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a little-needed sleeping town at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-inhabitant community has the lowest educational rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupid circumstance, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictional bridges depicted on the euro notes as pretty brushed reinforced concrete thumbnails.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library had to come here!
Winy Maas from Rotterdam’s architectural firm MVRDV, master of bold beam diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with a familiar calmness and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was still looking around with amazement and shrugging their armpits, the naughty Maas piled up his exquisite gifts to a pyramid and concluded his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear city community!"
So that is he, my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has been dumped.
It is part of a revitalization project, which includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjoining residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small town resort, which up to now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an astonishingly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory in order to make a piece of contemporary architecture richer.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression: bookseldorado under cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true pleasures of space and reading open up when climbing the topography on foot.
The all around glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt clinker floor and the elegant street lights speak unequivocally the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for park bench, dog and soccer-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Normally, the bookshelves are located along the facade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and flipped the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: In the center are offices, internet library, chess club, environmental center and house technology center.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes brüstung, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, feel and smell are strangers.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the standard.
And so we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a Frisian farm one day.
For many years, the Netherlands has been using a millimetre-thin plastic fleece as its root base in greenhouses and fields.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one, two seasons, after which it is ripe for blocking waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed into plates four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) discolors into a dark, homogeneous, resilient material, which smells like new cars and like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-metre-long hiking tour, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the many glass surfaces, this house is a flagship project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass tumble, even on sunny days the sun shines only briefly inside.
The wide wooden glue binders, which stand transverse to the glass facade, serve as shade and capture a large part of the sun’s radiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest will be done fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT industry, already ventured the way to the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even refers to the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse’s “long overdue soul”.
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the time being, this is intended to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has gone up.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
“Nothing is worse than a semi-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only for ornament.
With this, MVRDV has succeeded in the royal discipline that is called identity foundation in the jargon.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a bigger role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
It was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy from a policy managed by the US to a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still tackling their role, but they are on the way to a more “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy such as that of France or Great Britain.
What does a “normal” foreign policy actually mean from a German point of view?
It also shows the willingness to take positions in national interests that are independent of those of the US or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect attitudes in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to push the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
In any case, it matters.
But I wouldn’t want to put too much weight on that either, this isn’t a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I believe there is a great deal of understanding of the German position in Europe and even in the US.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Germany may even have some respect for it.
Because it signals that as an international player it has to be taken seriously and its interests have to be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted in favour of a veto.
Are there disagreements between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has a lot of understanding of the European position.
But due to the political situation here, of course, the government cannot publicly represent this position.
I believe that the real differences are not as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, then Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to agree on its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a bit easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not currently the case.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead push things out of their own position.
This is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future, Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans are aware that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player – does Germany even want to take on a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for Germany to lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, this is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a bigger role.
For example, if we look at the euro crisis, every time Germany takes on a greater role, a variety of anti-German feelings are released.
This does not make it easy for the Germans.
That’s actually the old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be receptive to a variety of neighbors and opinions, and that’s not easy.
Now the influence of the US in European politics is continuously declining, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is left?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if you don't like it, it's uncomfortable to you and makes you much more unpopular - c'est la vie!

‘Marke protection’ in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Yet, it enjoys protection as long as the real namesakes do not complain.
Even then, it is not clear if they are right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in intellectual property violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators already have a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
So Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had the Zegna DF Puma trademark protected, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and injured intellectual property is known.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively forgeries.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he takes the case against the fact that Chinese companies are officially given the right from the Trademark Office to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger brand.
The word is oriented to "Bang Dakuan".
This means women who fish for rich men.
Chinese authorities are not guilty
“This is business-damaging, you have to fight it,” Pattloch demands.
"The brand is being diluted, the uniqueness is disappearing, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the process costs of the affected industries go to the millions, especially for expensive showcase products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to reach and go into the money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the court rejected lawsuits because after the long duration of the disputed name had become "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiarism money because he violated his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there is the law of the jungle.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
To this day, the Chinese are allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who let the famous crocodile look in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty.
The trademark office CTMO in Beijing admitted that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to too little personnel and space.
Last year, however, they returned from the “emergency situation in the workflow to normal.”
Thus, the inventory of unprocessed opposition proceedings has decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still awaiting completion in the office.
To deal with it costs a lot
As is so often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that for the tenth time in a row, China is leading the list of new applications around the world, the authority said.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were collected.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To tackle this costs a lot, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Although the Germans were able to achieve that its illegal production of imitated motor vehicle parts was excavated.
But the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
They themselves have failed to do so, as family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office CTMO also rejected the Munich opposition.
In the next two instances Freudenberg got right, but the opponent of the trial continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful
The case is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident in bringing the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company’s archive had to search even 100-year-old files in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-digit euro amount" for settlement.
“This shows how much it is worth to us,” says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to return to Europe.
That is, when imitators secure unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business area, yet it has been able to avert registration.
“You have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and the lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very cautious when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather foreigners should “report everything that is somehow worth protecting to China,” as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg was subject to royalties for his own name in the last act of his brand drama, then one would have to pay the other side, explains Wentzler.
Or we are being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Stamping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the chorus Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland Aids orphans are happy about it.
The history of a connection that spans far more than 8,733 kilometers.
First is the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, women's pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - crowd, enchant and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his fabric shoes when he merges it with his smoothly wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
To the fifty singers have come, between the ages of 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
There are about 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations program to fight AIDS.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 Aids orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, the association Voices for Africa has found godparents in Germany.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a warm meal daily at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser in Zulu.
No one can speak Bantu fluently in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has practiced songs in this foreign soft language and now and then brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they are succumbed to the HIV virus.
In Esitjeni, it is shown in detail, what affects all of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, dying in their mid-30s is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets, who were not only lacking in parental care, but simply in everything: food, clothing, education.
Without graduation, you have no chance in a poor country.
Initially, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal in the day.
But just a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoids.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human Pappiloma viruses, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies are among the parasitic STIs.
Who are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and trippers are especially common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungal), trippers, and human Pappiloma viruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - yet: around 20 percent of HIV new infections account for this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country, humane Pappiloma viruses are also common in adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1,697 diseases in 2001 to 3,698 diseases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2700 cases.
That’s about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
The infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort during urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
In some cases, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through lubricating infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially with frequently changing sex partners.
When diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and late consequences can be avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the Gagen, which the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, such as with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women in Zulu are called, are the bases of the village.
Some of them have received up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads, and make sure that the children in their uniforms appear on time for school lessons every day.
If you don’t have anyone left, you come to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid just as much by the club as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has launched a sewing school, built two chicken houses and organized jointly with the American health organization PSI, which many in the village have had an HIV test.
This is not a matter of course, because as obvious as the disease is in the whole country, you prefer to keep it dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
It’s strange in a country where the king has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
While there are free condoms at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
“Culture is different – flesh to flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels together every two or three years through southern Africa, singing songs full of weeping, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many at the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also quenched some grim border soldiers a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if you can hardly find the small village on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
“Go to Esitjeni, there is the light,” the people say.
And when you return the 8733 km airline to Heidelberg, to the stabbing singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining there too.
NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet may be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science".
The probe Messenger has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said chief scientist of the messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help clarify how water and other building blocks of life have gotten to other areas of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth citizens, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small holes in infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto orbiting the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a “planet” according to the 2006 International Astronomical Union definition.
This section of an infrared image of the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are recognizable as blue dots, more difficult to identify are the pink "newborns" in the star circle hall.
This star-forming region - unromantically called W5 by scientists - has been discovered by the telescope Spitzer in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star has captured NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic birth.
The Pleiades cluster, also known as the Seven Sisters, can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come out better.
Like a red age, the Helix mist in this infrared photo looks towards the viewer.
It is located 700 light-years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this nebula the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular color scheme.
This baby star could only be recorded in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they were formed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the biggest and sharpest shots of the Hubble telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, which is several thousand light-years away.
The name trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-part, three-part), as dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the star-birthplace.
In the constellation of snake bearers, astronomers have photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carabiner: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth recorded the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If there are no technical abbreviations, they may call it the Southern Fire Wheel.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows an excerpt from the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The mist, which is 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, recorded the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
There is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new youngsters.
Also, this star cloud, coupled with the rosette mist, continuously produces new baby stars - 5000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it originated shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: the most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 – even before Galileo Galilei used it for stargazing a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been getting bigger and bigger – and the insights they provide are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
Arizona, United States, is home to the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows views into space directly over two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone comes to 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favorable design: The telescope is tightened in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the height angle.
Its peculiarity: the high light collecting power.
This is because, despite the comparatively small mirror diameter, it is close to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is the Very Large Telescope, which pays homage to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the Chilean ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror is supposed to comprise a whopping 42 meters - and be assembled from almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be expected at the earliest in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea observatory, which looks up next to them with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea a new, huge telescope is to be built - with a mirror-average of thirty meters.
Here it is to be admired on an illustration.
However, the most important impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The last preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the picture.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be shot into space on board an Ariane5 rocket at the earliest in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to look for light from the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the messenger orbits the planet far closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have hinted for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Through the messenger probe launched in 2004 – the first to circulate around Mercury – scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and turning 168 years old
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for traces in the country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The drive through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus romps over the winding road, past densely forested hills, bursting rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysians, of which not much is known, except that it speaks perfectly Persian as well as Aserian and is very durable.
The terminus is Lerik.
The small town boasts overweight architecture from Soviet times, which does not even want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult is the arrival of Azerbaijan’s capital Baku.
It takes eight hours for the 323 kilometers, because the road is only one-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to attract tourists.
“Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Festival in May – and next year we have a festival of the oldest people in the world here,” Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the vita of about eight dozen Talys from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 years still a child conceived
However, the museum’s controversial star is the sheepherder, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented human being, who turned 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems to be extremely doubtful.
"He was born here in 1805, he died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he was said to have had a daughter.
So, at the time of his old age, did Irali Müslümov settle for a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the seniors in Central Asia.
"There are also strikingly many high-age people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are extremely many very old men."
However, due to lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age can be kept, especially since registers of civil status were missing.
Bechally melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik remarkably often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why do so many people live here in the South?
The Aserian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysians.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is because of the diet.
However, the fact that the high-calorie diet of the Talys is supposed to be so healthy, that they love meat, bread and especially dairy products and that many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik.
At 97 years old, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that rolls her back and forth tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and one daughter, both of whom have long since been grandparents.
Two young children are also jumping around.
In the kitchen, guests can prepare tea, which is served in the typical, belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth stand perfectly in line and limb, under her headscarf she hides long, dark-blonde braids that her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never left me and kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has always eaten only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven’t bought food at the supermarket once in my life.
Then she tells about her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst in the post-World War II period.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult that is driven around the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows hardly any borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, and later his son Ilham took over the helm.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan’s old people.
230 manats (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions an amount from which one can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-graved son is right: "The elderly enjoy respect in our culture."
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human rights” is missing in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the country’s deep division.
The future constitution with Sharia law as its basis is fiercely controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We need to make the transition.
“And that it succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and seculars.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly disputed in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a state of God on the Nile of the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
He almost apologized for temporarily cutting the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanding his powers to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are aware of, the world is not quite clear.
Should the judiciary be deprived?
In fact, the 234 articles whipped by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly because in a nightly, 15-hour parforce ride, are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
What does “principles” mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the spongy formulation and the associated legal scope for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This suggests at least a new article: In all matters concerning Shariah, the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country, must be consulted with great radiance throughout Sunni Islam.
This may not be necessary, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto result in the judiciary being dismissed.
Much of the draft is an issue of interpretation
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction should continue to be maintained.
These courts served to suppress opposition during Mubarak’s reign.
After the dictator’s overthrow, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
The state should also “protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote their morals and values.”
This is so vaguely formulated legally that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature with the help of this article.
Clearly, this means nothing more than censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly stipulates equality between men and women.
For this, another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Similarly, the phrase “insulting people” is dubious.
Is it enough to have a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a lawyer?
It is a matter of interpretation, as is so much in the draft, which Mursi is present for signature and will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum "very soon".
"The Revolution Has Returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the Islamists’ supremacy.
Tens of thousands gathered in unfamiliar harmony on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to bring down the Charter before it can come into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will win,” Hamdin Sabbahi, third-placed presidential candidate, said.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and ex-chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution “belongs to the garbage dump of history.”
Via Twitter, he accused the supporters of Mursi of wanting to run a “coup against democracy”.
“If he declares the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned,” the Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew for counter-demonstration, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nile bank in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists participated, shouting, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi, "Clean the land!" and said, "The Quran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have evoked civil war-like conditions.
Mursi's followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the proponents had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists’ draft is considered safe.
“The word human rights doesn’t even occur.
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this forced constitutional process, which should have gone through to February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
“And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution,” he laments in conversation with the “World on Sunday.”
Mursi’s expansion of power to all three powers in the state caused the lawyer to resign.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is effectively putting it out of effect,” Saeda laments.
Without civil society, democracy cannot work.
Saeda feels alone, even by the international community, which looks at the ideological directional struggle on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could take revenge.
A protester on the Tahrir warns: “You are giving birth to a monster that you can no longer control.”
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the worst-smelling fish in the world?
Norway’s five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards – not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the country’s secret of success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty bad-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, moist sports clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
One must imagine the nasal smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway’s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is salt-sprayed trout, which - depending on how smelly you would like your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When darkness comes over the country in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, dedicated to this, well, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then flush it down with a glass of Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk General".
People around us eat small fish cubes and consume large amounts of alcohol.
“People like the Aquavit more than the Rakfisk,” says Havard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I'll taste a few bits.
If you avoid bringing the rakfisk near the nose, it is not bad - like sushi, which has a quite long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling possibilities yet and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the deepest winter, he was then removed after a long fermentation and - undoubtedly with the help of alcohol-stamped senses - consumed.
Even a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, who was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants flock.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, though strictly smelling, part of Norwegian history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn’t make it to the world press often, and most people don’t seem to bother.
Here one still hates to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "July 22nd incident".
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Mainly responsible for Norway’s wealth today has been the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with ripe rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and prickly blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Their English is just like most people here flawless.
We're not very insidious, we don't like boasting.
Norway has handled its oil richness very cautiously – a large part of the industry’s revenue is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global economic crisis, when everyone threw money around them that they didn’t even have, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat rakfisk," she adds with carefree laughter.
I stand in the snow and stand for another dish - from Rakfisk I have enough.
A moose burger is definitely something else. The juicy meat mouths me.
But in the evening, the stink fish is on the menu again.
The hotel where I stay is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There is a live TV circuit to a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates with Rakfisk.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jäger?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
They clap and laugh.
A man falls off his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the rigorous haze of the whole fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares for his inauguration, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges ahead of him and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is currently particularly poor.
Even on better days, this is an ever-clogged city, but on Monday a steel ring was built that blocks several important traffic routes to the capital and creates chaos on the streets.
The goal, however, was not to disturb commuters on the way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidential bond and take over the leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderons, Mexico has proven itself economically well, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already cost 60,000 lives in the last six years.
“My government is strongly committed to reducing violence,” Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to joining the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A direct man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, one likes to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute it to the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built, which are a big improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques with its name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect him to make real and lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for the Pena Nietos party, the PRI.
In particular, as far as security and the economy are concerned, we hope for an interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations for Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the allegations of the opposition that the new president lacks substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway crossings and in many ways represents a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are crucially urban in nature.
Earlier this year, the military was turned on to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a spot near a large garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During the presidency of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico – a statistic that even surpasses that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Critics of Pena Nietos believe that he did not adequately address the problem of women’s murders during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government has closed their eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the deserted neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
“When I arrived at her home, it seemed like her body had been washed,” recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the corpse star had already begun.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall. It is attached next to a cross that bears one single word: justice.
But that is exactly what the family has been denied her so far.
The authorities treated me as if I were a chatterer, a troublemaker, a naughty woman.
They want you to just accept their judgment and keep your mouth shut.
“But that’s not possible if there were so many form errors and failures,” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bond on Saturday, he also assumes a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this issue during his tenure.
“I hope as president he is the way he was as governor,” said Pri Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza are the most afraid of that.
Prosecutor's Office Says Bradley Manning Didn't Complain About Abuse
Prosecutor contradicts Bradley Manning's allegations of being abused in prison
The hearing deals with Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defense seeks a rejection of the indictment due to harsh detention conditions
U.S. Army liberator accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
The prosecutor’s office on Friday tried to determine that army officer Bradley Manning – accused of revealing the greatest amount of confidential information in U.S. history – missed several occasions to complain about the alleged mistreatment he suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein explained that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia had no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held as a result of a defense request to reject the charges - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the hard prison time - Manning had said that he had considered suicide in prison.
The U.S. military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein went through the forms that officials had filled out after their meetings with Manning during his imprisonment in Quantico military prison, where he had held from July 2010 to April 2011 under enhanced detention conditions.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein questioned him on the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards as “excellent” and the treatment by the institution as a whole as “very professional”.
The forms, so Fein, contained no complaints about abuse, although officials had asked Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they would deal with them, but they had not been recorded.
“They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) ‘No problems,’ and that didn’t necessarily mean I didn’t say anything at all,” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to examine the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to have his observational status downgraded to “prevention of injuries.”
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status – which is one level at risk of suicide – to his and the protection of others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well, and get rid of the observational status to prevent injuries (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning announced Thursday his arrest and relocation to Kuwait, where he was detained for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had become unconscious due to the heat.
Not knowing what happened to him or to the outside world was a burden.
“My world was shrinking on Camp Arafjon, on this cage,” Manning said.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell – at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours – and without company.
He was only allowed a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because on the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and the guards could not see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally filed an appeal against Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - for example, he had to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had a chance to wrap himself in his blanket during this count.
During the interview on Friday, Manning said he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket he could have covered, but he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning had testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning told the official he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning said, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his detention experiences into account and drastically reduce his detention rate should he be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser offences, while other charges that are considered too extreme will be challenged.
The continuation of the hearing is scheduled for this weekend. The prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon remains in its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the provisions that apply to all prisoners detained under the highest security precautions in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favoring the enemy, illegitimate publication of intelligence on the Internet, the transmission of national defense information and the theft of public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he is threatened with a life sentence.
The Mexican-American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to lack of chances
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants – they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at passport control as perplexity spread within me.
Signs referred to two queues: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure what to go to.
I grew up in central California and have been called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - exactly as my friends in Boston call themselves "Ireans" or my friends in New York "Italians".
Later, I chose "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s home there was no need for shortcuts or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in this language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I won't let go of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and put myself in line for extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all the issues that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are equally likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue the war of Mexico against the drug cartels, even though he did not give any details.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country’s leadership to leave them more than half of their territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
As soon as a U.S. government official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you hear complaints - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how the Americans are pressuring the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma go on the war path.
And yet Mexico’s biggest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Want to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican origin live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at one point in our family tree, a person – perhaps a parent or grandparent – was not offered a chance in Mexico and migrated north.
And in most cases, this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream we live - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurred at times, but as far as our loyalty is concerned, it is not.
This is clearly true of the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leadership class do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a memorial of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have gone.
And then we wouldn’t be trapped behind the silk curtain now – with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally immigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take this badly.
While she is a US citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel like they don’t belong to one country or another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but not one of them is rooted in you.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my journey, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational bourgeoisie want to resume their ties to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary “ambassadors” for Mexico, who represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That won't happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unjust distribution of income, unbridled corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure if this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through that alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans have a resentment for how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to suffocate such hope in the germ.
In the midst of the usual blame, countless buildings have been destroyed, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed – and for the first time rockets have been launched from Gaza near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not – Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these turmoils.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate could finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems anything but appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the armistice agreed on 21 November continues, the struggles this week have strengthened the hard-hearted on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has been controlling the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, despite the fact that its group itself has suffered great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1.7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Strip are imprisoned in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders might conclude that they have the time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a reviving regional power once considered Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken sides for Hamas – just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist imprint may face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And especially the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt – by far the most populous and most important Arab country – on the southern flank of Israel has changed the region’s balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
On the other hand, the brotherhood with Hamas is weakened and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw an opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a danger.
The Israeli missile defense system, “Iron Dome”, has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
For at least a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
In diplomatic terms, the United States firmly maintains its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalations in violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers – not least thanks to the barriers that run into the West Bank and thus into the majority of any Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal, but are being further expanded.
Netanyahu’s Likud party allyed with an even more militant group in the run-up to the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why do these insidious Palestinians swindle and leave them their own state?
If they actually had control of the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their fellow workers in the Gaza Strip?
No, it is better to keep them behind the wall in check and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could make them a stroke.
Even if the Islamists, now in power in Egypt and in other countries, have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defense bill is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to repair their economy.
The fact that the pragmatic President Mursi teamed up with Barack Obama to reach a ceasefire could be a promising sign – and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think more long-term.
As the rest of the Arab world takes timid steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination – a powder barrel that will undoubtedly one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to push Hamas back in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand its diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside.
The correct answer is that which is represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and this newspaper: two states where Israel assigns territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms deliveries in the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchanges and a common Jerusalem.
Outlying Arab nations should also push Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the upcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama must also do his part to get Israel to negotiate.
During his first term he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems that he is also reluctant to participate.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted perspective.
The United States has an essential interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian legislation on uniform cigarette packaging comes into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world’s first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colors with neutral, olive-green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and cigarette smoke-stricken infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and images, from next Saturday, the only difference is between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small fonts.
This means Australia is introducing the world’s strictest regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government assumes that studies have shown that people who have not started smoking at 26 are 99% more likely not to start after that.
“You can see from a young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image,” says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the legislation would favour the black market trade, resulting in cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
“The laws will lead to serious, unintended consequences,” says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the intolerable packaging has increased tremendously since corporations British American Tobacco, Britain’s Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the laws two months ago at the Australian Supreme Court.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new inventories.
This is a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch lies in the popularity of social media with exactly the population to which the plan is aimed.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop interpreting cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“Whoever markets tobacco and has only a small area left to promote their products doesn’t get around the internet,” says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in experience reports on brands written by “very normal people.”
One has to ask oneself the question: is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that they even record a video for it - or does a marketing agency have to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of marketing, the industry is focused on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new regulations – those countries are complaining to the World Trade Organization about unjust trade restrictions, even though none of the countries are doing larger trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has had talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to prescribe photographic warnings in 2001.
It has now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Harder laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
“You just take a tip and put the box away,” says Victor El Hage when he buys a cigarette box that has a photo printed with a mouth tumour.
Honestly, there’s only one reason I’d quit, and that’s my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the “King of the Pack” tobacco trade in downtown Sydney, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to refill its shelves.
“It used to take me an hour to sort out one shipment, now I need four,” Yu says.
“The government should have just completely banned cigarettes – then we would have told ourselves okay, that’s it, we’re closing,” he added visibly furiously.
In a constantly electrified world, it’s nice to be bored.
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think about being bored.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is quite annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it’s okay for us – and our children – to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought cycles, which may boost creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly stare at one or the other screen, the benefits of being bored no longer benefit us.
Should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yeah.
And no.
I will come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn’t think so.
“Actually, boredom has a very long history,” he says.
The house walls of Pompeii adorn a Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York, Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After reading research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of “wanting to do a satisfying job but not being able to do it.”
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
With apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is in a “disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is only slowly passing.”
Boredom can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes, although these two conditions may be related, bored individuals see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed individuals see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, even if we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention" - in German for example: "The inactive mind: The definition of boredom under the aspect of attention", which appeared in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content, others heard it at low volume, so it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they felt more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, couldn't find a reason for them, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a monotonous activity - "like finding faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that circling and scrambling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even fight them by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to rush around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a buzzing speaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored easier than others.
To measure these differences, in the 1980s, researchers developed a “Scale of Long-Term Oddness.”
On the scale, there are statements such as “a lot of things I have to do, repeat themselves and are monotonous” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have enough time for everything”.
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida – especially in terms of the need for more and a wider variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teens are a pretty tedious bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents with a pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adolescents were bored in school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were out of school.
However, only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn’t know if the percentages of boredom have increased or decreased.
However, he is sure that "youth is found to be particularly boring," mainly because children and teens do not have a big impact on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and fall into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown that.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors are investigating the relationship between boredom and creativity, which is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the topic for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s best to do.
If you are bored and you use that energy to play and cook guitar, you will be happy.
But while television can cause feelings of happiness in the short term, these can disappear in the long term.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, it can keep him from being bored, but it hasn’t taught him to entertain himself or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: “Self-control transfers from one situation to another.”
The child not only learns to talk, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
We shouldn’t be too critical of them either.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable even away from the constant activity and technology irrigation.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we have to be bored more often, but boredom is the tormenting, unceasing desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to shut down and relax.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated, it’s hard to get busy once the noise has stopped.”
In Colorado, there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law
The 19-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco stands in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in this state: possession of a few marijuana chunks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were traveling by car on a September day in Lamar near the border with Kansas when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug supplies – cavalry offences, each with a $100 penalty – and received a court appointment.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state’s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for home use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug offences depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of crimes related to marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington, which approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for possession to a small extent, which is permitted by law as soon as the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced they are continuing to pursue existing marijuana crimes and are still quoting people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denvers to the Western Mountains, vote to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“This situation is evolving so fast that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, which is east of Denver.
Regulators in the state of Washington are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance to set up a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline in mind until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado is believed to be ahead of most states in terms of marijuana regulation, where the drug was legalized for medical purposes and then for self-consumption.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is good for orientation," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Spirits Authority.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we can follow,” he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into force on December 6 and is the endpoint of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be resolved at this time – such as how to agree on the government’s requirement of “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
“Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent his staff in Aurora an email stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offences in persons over 21 years of age, and that the police would not seek criminal charges for these offences “from now on.”
Chief Oates added that police will continue to enforce urban regulations on regulating medical marijuana growers and drug traffickers will continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his authority would continue to track cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people have to face trial for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have also been charged for other crimes.
“Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations at the time of the crime,” Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are ambiguous even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer target adults for smaller amounts of possession.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding possession proceedings.
“I don’t think I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he says.
Although 55% of voters in Colorado supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile the personal consumption of marijuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the contradictory reactions across the state sparked a deep divergence among local officials regarding the big green experiment.
District prosecutors are a “cultural barrier,” says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana offenders in court and acts on the ground as a spokesperson for the national marijuana law reform organization.
“They’ve spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for legalizing them that they still can’t accept legalization,” he believes.
As the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are traded as national model cases for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a criminal offence at the federal level.
Proponents of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several sensational arrests of consumers and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, former Obama administration drug policy adviser, believes that while criminal officers are unlikely to enter doors to seize smaller amounts of drugs, they are likely to refrain from tolerating legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado don’t even wait for the federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local municipalities approved Moratorien for new marijuana stores, although these could only open in about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
“We don’t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are determined by what the community has chosen, not by what the state has chosen.
Many questions are still open.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are attacked for their views
It has always been my dream to get a place at the University of Oxford.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university which I once thought was the greatest stamp of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks after I moved to Worscester College in the late 1980s, where I had planned to study history, I had packed my suitcases again, bringing about the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I had gone because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the neighboring room.
Author A. N. Wilson slanderously explained that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
The truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had only been harassed for one reason – one that seemed so narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my now deceased father Woodrow Wyatt had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to current reports, a new generation of moderate-right students is suffering from similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now developed such dimensions that a group of them last week demanded the same level of equality protection that benefits gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College’s Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are “often actively isolated, personally attacked, and declared undesirable” because of their political views.
They demand a place on their college’s Equality Committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was aggravated by a recently aired documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," depicting Tories as an eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It featured, among others, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Oxford, who drove in a Rolls-Royce and wore silver-coloured suit and silver-studded walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered “sins for introducing higher tuition fees.”
20-year-old Luke Black, vice president of Nottingham University’s conservative student association, said in a Sunday newspaper: “There is a growing left trend in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even getting to know each other.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant." 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of Oxford's conservative student association, says she has observed a growing rejection of moderate-right students among JCR members.
“This poses a threat to intellectual discourse and to members’ well-being,” she says.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was a member of such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree due to cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have scared even Stalinists.
In the first days of the first semester week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what would happen in the future.
I had the experience that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even participated with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s rejection of sanctions against South Africa’s apartheid regime found their way into the tutorial’s wood-paneled rooms.
At my first of these events, I was supposed to translate 18th-century French texts into English, and I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled into it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite hateful.
"Will Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest they take a few French lessons in your free time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt grumbled at me.
I went back to my room with a hanging head.
That evening, I was sitting alone in college at dinner, when someone lightly tipped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is being harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be worse for you.
Most Tory first semesters pretend to be supporters of the Labour Party.
At a local pub, I later tried to adjust.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs. Thatcher on all matters.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A beginner in philosophy, politics, and economics who ironically attended Eton College, considered to be conservative, told me, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverse and dirty.
“How do Tories have sex?” one asked me.
They beat each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to live a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay before me stretched before my mind to a purgatory of contempt and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also because he had advised Thatcher on foreign policy and written speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for his Marxist-deterministic perspective on history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he told me.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford, and why I did.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the forties, all political views were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he said.
They would never do anything like this, not in my city of dreaming tower peaks.
Even my communist friends always showed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes clouded.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had given in to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another history tutor had seriously claimed that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly broke up in shame, I admitted that my parents had put me under a “brainwash” and called her “old fools.”
The relief only lasted for a short time.
It was my father who punched the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time he wrote two columns per week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my hens gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a crying cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer from such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragically, it was Oxford – a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened in London this week, ABC will speak to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion maker.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a grandiose retrospective for which more than 130 haute couture dresses have been put together, created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinctive clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the clumsy and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on display until March 3, there will be a variety of private letters and photos with the signature of the finest aristocracy, starting with Princess Salimah Aga Khan, through the Princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from the modest fashion maker in the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jetset.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
“At least they don’t kick out their chickens on your gorgeous rug, like some beautiful celebrities from pop music do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the two of them lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentine model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion maker.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music recognized and felt his influence.
“All those invited felt important and loved,” recalls the “top model” that began her career at the week of Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
“He never gets out of fashion because his designs are artworks,” she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60 meter long catwalk that proposes a reel change: the user takes the place of the model and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamy "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy owned for her wedding with Aristoteles La, or the leather of the Emperor's "Vitatele" onassi.
In this audience of fashion dolls radiate names like that of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit von Norwegen, Rosario von Bulgarien or Sofia von Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these customers say the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I still remember perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn/winter collection 1971-1972.
“It was a gift from him,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty,” Feria’s ex-duchess added.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader at fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses...
At the end of the 90s, it finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a cleavage that pays homage to its name.
“It was a dream come true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino doesn’t depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion maker "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller’s wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the fashion maker called his seamstresses) were necessary to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four and a half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the top authority of the professional press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the top society".
Years ago with the elite's "savoir-être", Valentino is now their best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, cumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his tranquility, his well-groomed and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg admits.
I saw him last time a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was immaculate; time leaves no trace of him."
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health if they carry 70 kilos of sulfur over the steep, stony paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others are literally working in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfurous gas flowing out of the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulfur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he transports them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the abyssed paths of stone.
While it’s only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that rises to a height of 2386 meters, the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend at the turtles pace, keeping balance and carefully taking their steps so that they don’t slip and crash.
You know that every step can cost her life, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 eurocents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
Arrived at the top, they pave the way between the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and walk with the tiresomely heavy baskets three kilometers to the Libra, which a mine company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, who has been exploiting the volcanic deposits since 1960 and (never better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for every kilo of sulfur.
This is then sold to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents), because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used for the production of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (€3.8) for each way," explains Anto, who usually runs three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day it has 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such a seemingly inhumane effort, however, is three times what he would earn from field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day for the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason as important as the sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs often and his eyes are irritated because of the toxic gases.
The 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen for three years, whose sulfur has already left the first marks on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special goggles.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
“I’m going to work here for another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,” he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This sympathetic and intelligent but life-punished young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter, or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a carrier.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o’clock, because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he has bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets with sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs, and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera, which the guards of this nature park charge together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) from the tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carrier.
“This work is for animals and not for humans,” protests Madrusin, a staunch, 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and itches the eyes, if the wind suddenly turns and clamps the miners in the thick columns that rise out of the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains of serious diseases ... of course, except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain, and blisters on the shoulders that have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks via a goat path between the bush to the camp in Tamansari at 18 kilometers distance.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano was my whole life,” explains Unainik, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
Of his five children, the elder, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but misery lasts from generation to generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: those who work as human donkeys on Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame for having no children on the career, stress, and cost of real estate and child rearing.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife: let's fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candies, but yet – or just because of that – they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song that includes local proverbs such as “sliving a “bao” (leaf) into the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, holds the hope that the commercial will reach out in a fun way to draw attention to the problem.
Their creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to fulfill their “national duty.”
This is just for the internet, so we had to make it funny and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this was an issue we had to deal with.
We knew the government had tried a lot, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating evenings (fast flirts).
Possibly many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why not make something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1.2 Children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the Government of Singapore.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that rate was above 2 – also known as replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Authority, says this is due to “better education” and “greater career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have much more options in terms of life goals and to set priorities besides getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of singles and to delaying marriage and births, the result of which is the reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counter the reduction of the population led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the barely masked xenophobia blossoms against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known impact on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It also has an impact on the housing market.
The Department of Urban Development has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" and allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single person, and that they discourage the construction companies from building large apartments for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" can be sold much faster than larger housing units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out by days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards give developers clearer orientations, which were previously put in the way of obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they won’t have a big impact.
"People are heavily stressed, the apartments and also the upbringing are expensive, which is why it is pushed out by many," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
“For me, it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another, about twenty-year-old man.
Men and women cite their careers, the stress and the cost of property and upbringing as reasons that they cannot have children.
That’s why Singaporeans have the final say when it comes to having children – the government can still do so much.
The offline Private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under the age of 16?
How is this definition applied to everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he makes known on the Internet situations that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who are often online.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to “something very own” on a personal level and “to the password and the user” when they applied it to the social networks.
“I wouldn’t reveal my deepest secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge while trying to explain the meaning of “private” in websites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother is allowed to know them, but not the whole world," he said.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or someone who makes the fool,” he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge assures to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if someone answers me, I just upload them,” he adds.
“The social networks are entertaining, I can quickly talk to relatives in the distance or with friends,” he says.
When asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommends him to a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
“That doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, like music,” he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If someone pushes me or asks me to do it, I’ll just remove him from my user account,” he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with experiences known today as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
According to José, the victim did not close the user account.
“He just did it privately.”
After that, he explains a series of steps to safely configure a user account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if he was unsympathetic to me or if I wanted to wipe him out.
“But I know this is cyberbullying,” he explains.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a master’s degree in pedagogy at the University of Yale and author of the work “Digital Natives and Immigrants” shaped these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
“We are the digital immigrants to teach them while we are still learning,” he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic “because we require them to have a defined criterion about what may be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age where maturity is not sufficient.”
“They should also be picky when it’s most important to them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is to ask them questions that will make them think.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t work,” he says.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the internet?
Or, would you like to have a photo of you posted, like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission beforehand when you labeled photos of celebrations?
And one more question: do everyone need to know what you’re doing in every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to trade online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks,” he explains.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, elementary school teacher and educational advisor, comments that it is indispensable for parents to carefully read the guidelines of the social networks.
By understanding all sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children need to be reminded of the lesson "You should not talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the release of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and was to be theoretically signed by the seven rulers present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the clausule, but then declared that it would be published on the Peruvian government’s website at some point.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio".
The little information circulated among the journalists was received by the press spokesmen of some of the unasured governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press spokesman.
The only document that was disseminated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which evoked discomfort among the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the presidential office of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the Humala declaration and not the official document to conclude the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit South America-Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite press urgency, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was not published.
On the official website of the ASPA you can be convinced that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were available, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of The Hague that resolves a border conflict between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Pisera, met during the regional meeting, confirming that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins Monday in The Hague, in the process that Lima initiated against Santiago to hear the pleas of both sides.
“We will obey and execute the judgment on the differences we are presently bringing to this international court,” Humala said with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be, a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts,” added Pisera, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
Both presidents confirmed that they would submit to the ICJ after Colombia filed an action against the Bogotá Convention after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered a serious mistake, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
At the summit, the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner, were present.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunchtime in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, which stated that 16 decisions were taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries were set for a total investment amount of $17 billion.
Concerning the decisions taken, he said that countries of unasur “will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we are extending decisions on residence rights.”
He said that measures would be taken to “improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, and measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters.”
With the crisis in Europe, “economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but should serve to expand our production performance and show our peoples a better future,” added Humala.
“We have decided to give priority to a number of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America, and especially in rural and border areas ... and thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms,” the Peruvian president said in a read-out statement.
Among these projects were five Peruvian ones on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are supposed to provide a better connection to Ecuador, although he did not provide any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its re-establishment in the Union of South American nations," he said.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that on Saturday in Mexico, he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, to treat the maritime conflict with respect following a judgment of the IGH called into question by Bogotá.
“Maybe tomorrow I’ll meet with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
"We will review all of these ways - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary," he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to be present at the inauguration of the country’s new president, Enrique Peca Nieto.
As part of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the action plan for 2013, in which dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region will be strengthened.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru is chaired by the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn how to integrate citizens," says Rafael Correa
Ecuador’s President Rafael Correa confirmed today that creating a common citizenship is a goal where “South America can actually learn something from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told state television in Peru that Europeans “killed each other in World War II and other clashes” and “are practically a fatherland today.”
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that would push the member states of the Unasur.
“The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean community; however, there are still reactionary sectors that seek a return to the past,” he warned.
The President of Ecuador also endorsed the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA), with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States," he said in reference to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa reassured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but lived up to his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that there were “founded presumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and not comply with his procedure.”
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary, which demanded that he be interrogated on his territory for alleged sexual offences, while “Swedish jurisdiction allows this through a video conference that could have been conducted via Ecuador’s embassy in London.”
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange’s health and mental health would be compromised.
"Since he's been in our embassy, I haven't spoken to him, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with the lungs, but not a serious one," the head of state of Ecuador said.
However, there is a risk that he will take physical and psychological damage because he is trapped in a confined space and cannot perform physical exercises outdoors.
“That would affect the health of every person,” he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since June was the granting of a permit to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not applying this word to this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, runs a series of proceedings at various European instances," he said.
"If the UK grants this approval tomorrow, I think it's done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as allowed by Swedish jurisprudence and in other cases, the problem is done.
Correa seized the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the evil intent, and the lie that deny freedom of expression."
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who strive for profit and blackmail,” he said.
In this sense, he congratulated Ecuador that it would no longer be “dominated by such journalists, nor by bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries,” and anticipated that in the event of a re-election, “it will deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the organism “must remain tough and must not give way to opportunism and no coup legally disguised” because it “destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay.”
The president of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which favored Nicaragua’s maritime sovereignty, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, to be “absolutely justified.”
This judgment is not currently being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be comprehensively treated so that you can overcome them and look forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to call on international authorities if both countries commit to accept the verdict, even if it is very hard."
Regarding the possibility that he will stand as a candidate for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he said that he sees this opportunity “with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very difficult.”
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 election, he would withdraw from political life.
Power never interested me personally, but under circumstances as unfair as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement had the belief that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill that responsibility,” he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last period as president, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
“That’s decided,” he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke with Vice-President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, who told me that he had traveled there for a planned, routine treatment and that he was expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
“It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez,” he said.
Today, the Ecuadorian head of state took part in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is too late detection today
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the finding: HIV-positive.
“It was like a bomb hit,” he says about the moment he received the diagnosis that the doctor tried to “weaken” without recognizable success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to find out about it; and this with such dedication that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), in which he came after several fighting in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye “because it led to a dead end.”
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is also possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people who are unaware of their disease still come to the clinic, who have already done damage to the virus and have exhausted their immune system, and who are the victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the occurrence of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said HCG's head of HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information had been backed by a prestigious scientific publication in April of this year.
Andrade Villanueva, a specialist in infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of individuals at the start of treatment, and that those greater chances, which are not drug-dependent, are up to 50 years at CD counting.
Simply put, the above explanations mean that those who are diagnosed with HIV-positive at the age of 25 can, in this sense, "become 75 without problems as long as they are under control," said this expert.
In order to properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Even though mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (Onusida’s annual report), it is still true that since AIDS appeared, 60 percent of patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year there are already 187 deaths; however, it is assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
So why are people still dying of it?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have had no care problems with the drugs. The problem is that the people are in a far advanced state because they do not know their infectious state, i.e. at very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have a concomitant infection. To influence global mortality, early diagnosis is needed, which is why massive detection tests must be offered to all people who need it."
The experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee on AIDS Prevention in Jalisco) and also patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test carried out at a private laboratory, agree with this proposal, and this for the only reason that it had made a friend of him who, despite his young age, was already a cancerous person in the AIDS phase.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, just like everyone else.
“I work, do a lot, have an active but responsible sex life, I pay attention to my health and that of the other person,” adds Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO Jalisco to animate with his testimony those who are scared today as part of the global AIDS day.
The sooner they know if they are HIV-positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big holes between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken care of the case of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; formerly they were delivered individually, now they give us packages with a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the people at risk for new infections are young people.
“Why do you need it?” is a common question of social workers, orientation staff in schools, pharmacy employees and the health system that young people do not want to expose themselves to, the correspondent assured.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; the condoms should be located not only behind the counter, but in dispensers in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González responded to the question of whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like this; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaging in sexual activity," he said.
Key data of Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
Nationally, the state ranks fourth in new and accumulated AIDS cases, and thirteenth in terms of HIV.
92% of infections occur via sexual intercourse, 6% via blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 people for each registered case who do not know.
After the U.S. Court of Appeal has confirmed a ruling that does not recognize the restructuring of Vitro Group’s liabilities achieved through a trade bankruptcy in Mexico, an ominous precedent is created for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the land of stars and stripes in contravention of international agreements.
In practice, the June 15 recognition of the judgment by judge Harlin Hale at the Bancarrotas Court for the northern district of Texas leads to the Mexican companies being subjected to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door to the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge of the case points out that creditors must be subject to U.S. bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit’s New Orleans-based appeals court first says that the main case is the trade bankruptcy dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings for companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute being used as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that without the votes of the companies after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy mass held by Vitro’s branches with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among Group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also correct that, after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who complained against Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote was 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the major economic crisis in the United States, which gave the country blows.
For this reason, the González Sada family appeals to the same Court of Appeal to ensure that the vote takes place in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare appeal will be filed, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious thing about this case is that the court left aside a document sent by the government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Trade Bankruptcy Act, and which indicates that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
It is also pointed out that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Two-band caramboles: a blow to vitro and to the country.
General balance sheet
After several months of failure by the Mexican Air Transport Unions against former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Association of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The request, led by Carlos Dáaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accused of hampering the judiciary.
After that, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the trader in order to withdraw from the trustee account F/589 of Bank IXE to the name Mexicana de Aviación 198 million pesos.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares of the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is encircled
At a weekend meeting at a University of the Caribbean forum, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing industry) has reached to unite the governors in the southeast to resist the monumental institution, which partly destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all the threats of industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government failed to comply with a request from the Senate to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, the matter has already been archived, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures took place even though the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In the pursuit of paying long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching over 500 million pesos on the market.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
Formed from the companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading information technology companies, a group of companies under the name Competival was founded, whose goal is the service market of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments are more than $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The basketball world champion, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been involved in basketball for more than 60 years and has travelled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the country's history of basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a lower class player, first national league player, authorized representative and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball association.
"My life I have put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time as I was president of the BSN, chief executive of the national team and president of the association in the 90s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and bear witness to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-director or managing director of the club.
“These were my best years that I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve been part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, whether as managing director, co-director or coach.
It was many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to BSN with a 1981 championship, the year of Jerome Mincy’s debut.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator," Reyes says.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me: "I have a very strong and 2 m big player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended free throwing specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a naturalist and one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the association in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and Mincy's on the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, if it hadn't been this Canadian referee who had us repeat the last turn for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the team of the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered the US team a fight, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
In that team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toyot" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 due to a knee injury.
One team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the 1995 pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as a substitute for the blocked players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal contrary to any forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
It was Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated as much on this level as Piculin.
And this without considering his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved in the association?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which comprised the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalization of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of 1980s greed, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who came back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family press release at The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He rejoiced with all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted that he had been drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was detected in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas", Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Beautiful Jeannie" of the NBC television station.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, such as The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film works included critically rated roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly detestable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS TV series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its surroundings was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot J.R.?", which was supposed to create expectations for an episode full of emotions, where Hagmann's character was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were betted in betting houses.
The series reached a record attendance at that time.
When the answer came to light in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers who turned "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin who had shot J.R.’s sister-in-law (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had conceived her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city, but others also had reasons to want him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) registered.
"I know what's on J.R.'s gravestone," Hagman said in 1988.
It should be said "Here rests the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality on and off the screen."
It is memorable and irreplaceable to millions of worshipers in the world, and it remains in our hearts for those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new issue of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT television channel.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was complete, and a sixth chapter was just being shot, the station informed.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how Hagmann’s loss would be treated in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stages in New York in the early 1950s, after which he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he wrote his memoir Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t write anything that I believed could harm or in any way affect someone,” the Associated Press said.
After the liver transplant, he advocated for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
“I advise them, give them courage, I meet with them when their operations are imminent and after that,” he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, such as “don’t worry, it’s a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you’ll be fine”.
He also opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "end of the world"
Each week, students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long backward count” on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called the "Deudarmaggedon," as well as a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
“I didn’t realize this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If someone analyzes what happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor to offer courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history.
In Temple, Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students investigate apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
“I’ve been trying to inform students about what’s possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, formed a team to offer a course called "The End of the World."
“We’re not recording 2012 so we can always keep the option of holding the course again in case the world doesn’t go down,” Restall said.
Despite the "probable demise", students must study, create projects, and participate in final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam is conducted on the eve of the apocalypse, which is why students have no other chance than to “go on working until night, where the world is supposedly coming to an end,” Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more seats," Restall said about his course for high-average students, which filled with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still spaces available.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It’s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers-Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sect or religious mentality is actually only a matter of consolation or its lack.
The 25-year-old student Will Wekesa for psychology and nursing claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a class where this is taught,” he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students surveyed – and less a professor – declared to believe in the last date of December 21.
“Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit it,” said Julie Zeglen, a student last year at Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayas never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that in Western society there is an apocalyptic fear that goes back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
“In other places, people don’t think so,” he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches in the Philippines this year, responds quickly to the question of whether he would know a course about the "end of the world" there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote as an indication of an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years, many days were spoken of by the Last Judgment, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophized that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world would come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about “the end of the world.”
“Maybe I’ll call a couple of friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
