Barack Obama is the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to be the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, medal and a $1.4 million check for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Norwegian metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time at all with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestige prize.
He is the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to receive the prize directly in office.
The White House has already determined that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when he takes over the prize.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
A few days ago, he intensified the war effort by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event program will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, with the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests in addition to Norway’s King and Queen.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the start.
For example, he cited that he felt he didn’t deserve the prize.
He repeated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that this was for him a "call for action".
Conservatives accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases, he appealed against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in custody and faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting trash containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the sorting trash containers again.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable trash cans.
I don’t want to say that the waste separation in Brno wouldn’t work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councillors are not sufficiently concerned about this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of trash cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket?
This is art, and above all, it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian square opposite the affected goose.
Mr Onderka should not be upset by his colleagues, but that seems to me far too little.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste is not a bite of honey in other parts.
Therefore, whole rows of my friends prefer not to sort the waste at all.
From laziness.
It's too far to the trash cans.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But on Konicova Street, I did not see any color junk in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place while driving the tram.
The trash was almost over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us throughout the Republic, rather than buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance with official statistics after searching the internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The “Paroubek” budget has deprived the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party, despite the government’s view, gave farmers and officials more money, there is no more money on the budget for pensions, sick pay and construction savings.
But also not for the government interest rates or for international court disputes.
This creates even more problems for those who will be at the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to lend the money for the sensitive expenses, old-age pensions or for the sickness allowance. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mine laying," says Janota.
The loans pay higher and higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for state operations are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
To the pensions or the sickness benefit, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to be afraid, they get that money.
But at the price that the state is in debt even more - next year, not only will there be 163 billion missing in the treasury, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase faster and faster, and together with this, the costs and interest rates will increase.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to raise VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its regional deficit package.
Because of the money diversion in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of motorways and railways.
These are predominantly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly discounted.
Get at most, which is not free either.
This means delay or discontinuation of thirty large buildings, and Europe’s money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it trigger the outflow of money in Solomon – it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from these the money is then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion euros went from CEZ to the budget.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to the EU rules, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of the revolutions has not yet ended.
Nearly three billion dollars lowered the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses for court disputes, even for building savings.
Whether the state can cope without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister must then save the money within the department or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the two-billion-dollar project "Staatskasse", which is to enable on-line monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions will come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and Windows Mobile will change Android within seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles on the mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware suggested during an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM memory, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now, VMware is working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to come to the customer within 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains tormentes hotel owners
Snowless slopes worry not only the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also scares people away from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
If you want to stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your expectations, you should no longer hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save and where the quality of the stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The spindle mill hotel owners now offer mostly weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will try to sell these for a while, but then they too will have to give in and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will fade quickly, Jandura estimated.
Free beds on all winter dates are always offered by the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, led the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year's Day in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer places available here.
Good sales also take place the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, Schiefert says.
Conversely and a little better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year’s Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also go well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
For the New Year’s Eve stays, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied by the central car park in Janske Lazne.
By contrast, half of the beds remain free at the latest hotel in Janske Lazne for Christmas.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
February is now a bit weaker, but the moment the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a greater snow protection.
On Thursday it should cool and in case of rainfall it should be snow on the mountains.
But then a warming is to come again, Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove informed.
U.S. Repetition is a Mother of Wisdom
It’s almost strange with what student aspiration Barack Obama, the president with his call of the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy in the Afghanistan question, which he himself thought was the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off on the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he has even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Path" without hesitation.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending out fresh contingent troops into the Iraq plagued by the civil war as a “irresponsible and in their conclusions disastrous decision.”
However, the following months showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and, to this extent, very successful, and that today the news about Iraq is not talking at all.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting point than was expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to increase the contingent of troops, the military asked him again, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even in spite of the subordination habits harshly criticized the turbulent shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the fraternal war of recent years, the Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by contraindications - no one can be relied on and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only shams, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the ambiguity of the conditions that complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran even further.
Building a “capable state” which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation is also very unrealistic.
Obama’s strategy’s time horizon is alienated by its voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and now it is on the brink of the explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who have erupted into the scream of war over the "early return" can create a miracle here can only be a truly romantic soul, which cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will take this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is in decline.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindukusch mountain foreland.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period when America moves on to the victory withdrawal from Afghanistan after Obama.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to go until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to resort to another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive bonuses in cash
The senior executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This is what the company has announced, which is responding to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street’s premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the far-reaching direction in which it has to go, led former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs made himself the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the beginning of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge bankers’ bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, with a 50 percent tax once.
Similar steps are also being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record-breaking women took over this year’s Nobel Prizes in subject categories and literature in Stockholm from the hands of Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf.
In addition to the four female scientists, there was also the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine has been awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for research in the chromosones field.
Israel’s Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, has been awarded the Prize for Chemistry for Enlightenment of the Ribosome Structure and Function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics to the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have won this prize for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines, or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of acquisition of the money prize.
This is 10 million Swedish kroner in each category.
If there are multiple prize winners in each category, the money price will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
He has acknowledged in his speech the controversies of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and he is also at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in keeping with his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the struggle for world peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives Finance Minister Eduard Janota early on Friday, who is considering remaining in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps Janota’s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The presidential spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota will be negotiating with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, however, the parliament voted on the Left Party proposals for money revolution and increased the money for the state officials’ salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of Social Democracy to covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute arose, which raises the question mark about the further work of the Fisherman’s Office, on whose design the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the Fisherman’s Government in the autumn, which, in their understanding, should end the government’s debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget, said today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have for a long time neglected the "serious problem" that constitutes "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is horrible, and the government should weigh its continued existence.
ODS vice-president Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial board as "strong statements."
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit that the former Topolanek government had prepared for this year was horrible, exceeding 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Mandela was starred in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman.
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world much of the country, of whose struggle and victories despite some criticism that the leading role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sport, race relations and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood movie.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I'll have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, from which eventually became a slave owner, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film portrays a real event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through the sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are outsiders worldwide.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to approach it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I noticed that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transferred, and I felt like I knew what you were feeling, he said.
It is important for me to become another person.
Matt Damon is portrayed in the film Francois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have outweighed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar in my life was, ‘In the movie, I look much bigger.’
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Ungeschlagen" and one also speaks of prospects for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the following words: "That was very good story, very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the websites rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light Mystery Dissolved About Norway: The Russians Have Tested a Rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was again unsuccessful and the rocket called "Bulava", which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality and the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also his repeated presence on site at the rocket test had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has usually not been launched at all or damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers already write about “bulava” as a “missile that does not fly”.
A rocket that does not fly, but lights up
This thirteenth attempt was normal in the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskiy, which sailed under the water of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows firing from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "bulava".
The Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian rocket.
The generality has defended itself against it this time, claiming that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and the third stage was only affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test launch was made without error, the Department of Defense’s leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and so it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atomic blast heads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defensive player Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself at the age of 51 in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps out his team CSKA Moscow in distress, and probably already competes in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will only concern one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morals of other players, Nemcinov performed.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played for Hartford for an entire season at fifty-one and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles and also triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he twice raised the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey star room.
Hyundai surrendered to the trade unions. All overtime will be lifted
The management of the Nosovice car factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the lifting of all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the union announced its willingness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, which is why volunteer overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, for the reason that two shifts of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The staff will also receive it retrospectively for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will be paid the fare and lunch.
Considering that the overtime was the most pressing and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to lift all overtime for the month of December.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift.
As of the signing of the agreement, the willingness of the trade unions to strike will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are to be concluded on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the willingness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory spiked last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, held that the employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Monday strike readiness proclamation that the employees who interrupted production on Wednesday will not be subject to any sanctions.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions are calling for a minimum of overtime work.
In addition, they are demanding the payment of 5,000 kroner this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The series production started at the company in November last year.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works for ‘steeled’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on the viruses that are already resistant to medication.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not act as strongly on common virus variants as one of the existing drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured.
However, patients can prolong their life and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus proliferation also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no more drugs are effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalocarborans act on the protein that is responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists come up with new “improved” compounds that have been prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and Persistent Virus
HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus splitting caused by the HIV protease, no mature infection virus particles would arise.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also turn off the multiplication of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe entire series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in test tubes, including against their resistant variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical forms, makes metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research aimed at developing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute over budget. ODS started on fisherman, who fights back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for next year “grey” and Jan Fischer’s government should consider its continued existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS statement as “strong statements.”
It is said to be time for analysis.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Necas said that the Cabinet of Officials’ concept, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, apparently no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to fighting the rising deficit, or whether he is going to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the 2010 budget, but with proposals for more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has raised the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of Social Democracy to covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to operate with a backlog of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the room before the vote, so it has fulfilled the desire of the government, because the changed budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provision.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of meaninglessness, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in case the amendment proposals were accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up with the Prime Minister for Monday after the government business.
He said he was considering remaining in office.
This is due to his disappointment with the budget.
According to Necas, the nominees of Social Democracy (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also say clearly that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, such as those concerning sickness benefits and pensions or the new employment legislation.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
This is for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in deputy function there are people who are committed to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct to rely on the left-wing majority currently in Parliament."
Then he is supposedly unable to expect the support and tolerance of the citizen democrats.
I didn’t think about it, and if that’s going to be up to date, then I’ll deal with it, Martin Bartak, the defence minister nominated by the citizens’ democrats, told the journalists in parliament.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels at the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would likely vote against the revised budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister explicitly asked the members of the citizen democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not think of ourselves as orphans, we are not young children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiation of the budget due to the absence of the party leader in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
Already when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be primarily about bolshevising the parliament and destroying everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for about the same fare.
The Czech Railways will terminate or restrict some less busy express and local trains from 13 December onwards, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. basic and customer fare are not changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area receive several connections to the capital, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The high-speed train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
There will also be fewer express trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route, and some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to switch to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth traffic route of the Esko suburban traffic system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at a time interval of two hours.
Passengers can no longer travel to Bratislava with the Pendolino since December 13.
This year's regional railway bill: increase of 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, the railway receives four billion crowns for the payment of the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, just like this year. The local trains supply the districts, they pay eight billion crowns for it in the next year, with the state firing three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the high-speed trains, the railway has recently concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The rail system praises the system, which is perhaps why it did not increase the price of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes can only be made with one-day network tickets CD Net and with cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net will be increased from 450 kroner to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the line travelled, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine millitanes arrested more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitante kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
He was kidnapped in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 millitants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to release the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the militants belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers for the violence that demanded revenge actions between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right to stand was imposed due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was associated with the election to governorship, were 30 journalists.
For suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But on Tuesday, peace talks with the Philippine government resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood movie, Invictus: The Unbeatene, is coming to the American cinemas, which includes a part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been retained by Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African rugby champion, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, there are also reactions from critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, in 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Large expectations are set in the film because it comes into the cinemas at a time when preparations for the World Cup culminate in South Africa, on the one hand, but at the same time the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have been well prepared for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times in person so that I could receive his energy, as they say, he performed in an interview after the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can get rid of Mandela’s personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book template by British writer John Carlin, freely translated "In the Role of the Enemy": Nelson Mandela and the Game That Unified the People, portrays the South African human rights advocate within his first presidential election period.
Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racially distinct populations throughout the film, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he joins the world cup field in his role in the South African National Rugby dress, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white public, thus gaining the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may succeed in uniting people into a single people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the situation in South Africa is improving will only be apparent.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as revealed in a recent interview for LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire erupted in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman for the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is erased with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the line system, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million kroner, more precisely, the damage will only be quantified after the fire.
According to Mandova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened to the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokeswoman of the company CEZ for Northern Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech field as the sole operator of the line system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, refurbishes and develops 39 switchgear systems with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to a distribution system and line line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura filed a criminal complaint for slander against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today filed a criminal complaint for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company’s effort to operate regional train services in some districts.
In the end, however, all regions have signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, while we only submitted the offer over the scope as it was coordinated with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway, which were completed last week.
We have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Because of this defamation of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he argued that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment of the European Commission.
Hasek considers the prosecution to be the continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the reputation of my district, and I am also calling on other leaders to do so.
I assume that in this case too, it will become clear that it is Jancura who is manipulating the public in the case of regional rail traffic and using lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million kroner in advertising, which will indicate the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told Radiojournal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas, and continue it after New Year.
He stated that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign started Jancura after the districts agreed on the operation of the regional railway with the Czech Railway and had no tenders for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, a member of the CSSD also threatened him.
The only threat was, if we do not give up, that we can then also lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don’t say his name, Jancura told the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal is free and voluntary
Pneumococcal vaccination changes from January onwards.
It should be the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But even now, there are voices saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination culminate.
The medical institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that the health insurance companies have to pay.
Experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
Starting in January, children can be vaccinated for free against pneumococci born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccination dose.
Anyone who started vaccination last year or earlier will also have to pay for further repeat vaccinations themselves.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumonia.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for one dose.
Vaccination of the youngest children requires four doses.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance spends 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year on the vaccination cans.
But you save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all land vaccinations of children.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear infection, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children under the age of 10.
Outside the Czech Republic, compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
This will be paid by the insurance companies in January and will be voluntary.
That the compulsory vaccination would be better, for example, the head of the Bürgervereinigung Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned.
His association has been promoting long-term pneumococcal vaccination.
The experts at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in at least enforcing this.
I think that’s the way we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal.
At this moment, we are not considering that at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, chairman of the Association of Practical Pediatricians, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
"In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccine was launched as a voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcal from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcal is also groundbreaking in that it is paid as the first area vaccination by the health insurance and not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, thus saving them for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and then received by the doctors in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some MEPs feared, however, that the insurance could thus "expel the money from the health insurance."
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with trailer while inviting 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used an excavator to invade the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures like Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
According to Associated Press, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings to a camp."
The agency said Frank Frazetta Senior denied any permission.
Labour Defends Tax and Tax Increases
Ministers have defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the previous budget report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling had left an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Treasury was also under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public wages for 2011.
Social Security Workers
The unions have protested that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of imminent “problems.”
The increase in social security -- to around 3 billion pounds per year -- has upset the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on the economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than 20,000 pounds a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
HEAVES OF THE PREPARATION ETAT REPORT
Increase in social security by another 0.5% as of April 2011
This year, the economy shrinks by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax reliefs for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of 30,000 pounds per year will be poorer by 90 pounds per year, and someone with 40,000 pounds per year will be poorer by 190 pounds per year, while a person with 10,000 pounds per year will be 110 pounds richer.
Ministers said their goal of halved deficits by 2013 meant “difficult decisions,” but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be accounted for by the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending stops compared to the necessary measures would be “a drop on the hot stone.”
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit halvement and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour’s predictions of future economic growth – affecting the scale of the re-indebtedness and the speed of the deficit reduction – were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year -- far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April -- while debt would be 3 billion pounds higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years is untenable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan of how they will repay this and push themselves "cynic" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place at the latest in June 2010.
"They didn't say anything important about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond, "they had their opportunity to do this, and they let them pass by."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle and Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be protected from future cuts, unlike in the proposals of the conservatives, who see the deficit reduction coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money gained from the tax hikes and spending stops is being used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April – some things would expose the Chancellor to the accusation of voting, as the money could simply be retrieved next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra help when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed again in September 2010.
"Hole budget"
Although ministers have not announced budget details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only come into play in the medium term.
The recognized Institute of Tax Inquiries said the Treasury's figures would mean strong cutbacks in many areas, possibly in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said its leader Robert Chote.
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic advisor to the audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary report. The markets recognize that."
FBI investigates arrests of U.S. citizens in Pakistan
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Panjab province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and the circumstances under which they are detained,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed about the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
“We’re working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, in case it’s actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had been interested in the house earlier and that no charges have been filed against the arrested men.
The news agency Reuters reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must “work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty International condemns ‘abuses’ in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details “abuse patterns” by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected previous criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens were killed, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report from 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They hit me in the face more often,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... They threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty said.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also mentioned the case of a former prisoner who said he and 75 others had been detained in a container in a Kahrizak prison for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the riots after the election and the government’s reactions to them, but Amnesty said the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people were arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a competitive track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studies medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glistening below.
He added: “There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here – some real talents.”
Prizes were awarded for the best crafts or tricks performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still you and me
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted for a minarets construction ban and worries about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s most declared secularized societies – and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a dispute that divided and occupied the country over a decade and a half, and the impact of which can still be seen today.
Bowen’s latest book offers a wider and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls them, “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students about the questions that bother them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a city hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use a interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane affairs, he claims, that make up daily life, quite contrary to the political dramas that concern the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of whom have a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society.
You don’t have all the arguments on your side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Bowen interviewed are mostly disagreeable with their salafist counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes more of a “strengthening of the value screws” than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book you are inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The most desolate view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that identifies them melts at an alarming rate and takes life that nowhere else can survive.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have moved into the recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" a natural history of the icon of the north, the polar bear.
Skilled in the intricate history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old sea envoy who fought only with his musket’s rifle piston is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have one millionth of the life span of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore has become completely green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, slaughter continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor-sled Inuit use powerful assault rifles to bring their prey down.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
This is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries gave the first indication of the turbulence of the pack ice.
Submarines measured the shifting ridges during the Cold War.
A useful addition are satellite surveys and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system inside the Arctic ice formed by saltwater sinks that are compressed during freezing.
But, starting from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, everyone is threatened by this once the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, that could be me.”
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington.
De'Angello Robinson traveled by bus for seven hours to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other naval infantrymen who took Camp Johnson’s trip from Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the tombs of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred tombs in the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states as well.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the tombs at Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on tombs at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the second time to buy and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who made sacrifices.
She said this is a small contribution to how we can help civilians support our soldiers.
It is like visiting a family grave.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older tombs from the 1st and 2nd World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer tombs, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples were holding their hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled that area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the icy air.
Some read out loud the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black and white place cards that had been put into the moist mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of naval infraction officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free...my son paid for it, she said.
“When I’ve been away for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold cell phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and for the World Bank.
U.S. consular advocacy officials in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The special charges have not yet been published, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the accusation of “danger.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include slight protests and critical writings, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to accept prices, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro Brothers’ Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as release of political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Cell phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens imprisoned in Cuba are jailed for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Representation in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide further information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently released a harsh report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", replacing an allusion to Raul Castro's inauguration as the leader of the country, the sick older brother.
Vivanco said the defendants were very often arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government would often provoke a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after finding them because one of them had made agreeing comments on terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan’s intelligence agency, who was briefed on the matter, said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest that have become a terrorist refuge.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani prison authorities.
The case of the five men – who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI – underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists, and possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered to be immensely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access to in recent years, as U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to inject someone into these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators demand climate “action” in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded more bold action from the negotiators in the city’s Bella Congress Center on climate protection.
Protesters said that 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event went relatively peacefully, although a handful of masked activists set fire to small explosive devices near some government buildings in downtown.
One day, when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered around the city with banners saying in English, "There is no Planet B," and one in Spanish, which stated, "The Earth says 'Enough.'
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother’s homeland, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems that the country is struggling with due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the motivation I have chosen to participate in the big demonstration - to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there’s no way around it anymore.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes ignited several explosive devices near the Copenhagen main canal, near which there are several ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light-emitting missiles, but then were followed by “a few big explosions.”
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to reach the consciousness of major officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: “This is something I was not even aware of.”
He then went on in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual’s perspective whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they interfere with other people’s negotiations or freedom.”
Examination data reveals stubborn racial divide
The math performance testimonials last week were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D.C.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country’s top-performing schools, the testimonies show that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national levels.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but that of their African-American peers rose by only three points from 209 to 212.
Between 2007 and 2009, the performance gap increased from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African-American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have achieved has grown over this period of time, the difference has barely decreased with now 58 points.
Some of the district’s education advocates expressed concern last week that the results celebrated by school Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were largely driven by white students who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests we’ve raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group advocating education equality in Washington, D.C.
I’m not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councillor Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in fourth grade of Eaton primary school.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we don’t spend nearly the time and energy we would have to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper grades of elementary and middle school, who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peer classmates.
Daily Mathematics, a curriculum that comes to the fore from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelike experiences, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue working to get the best measures to benefit students who are below grade levels, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the extra money and resources needed to reduce the gap for low-performing schools.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to target its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could create political aftermath working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, is, as with other urban school inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most significant elements in closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the power to change, Janey said, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he considered as “a milestone” on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a prospect for the future
The coach reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets off and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eight-year-olds of the group exploring Gettysburg, where class costs $38,690 per year, was more of an awe-inspiring visitor than an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for science.
“Wow, really?” she thoughtfully said when she was told the school’s low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully received the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the U.S. who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to ascend to middle class.
In fact, one in five of those “second generation” of Hispanic Americans graduate from college – which is a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts persist for a longer period of time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point won’t solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis who studied Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela’s college tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP – One Gear Up – and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue running until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil Signs Agreements with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions completed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to register shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has pulled the shortest.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil spills at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and European are setting the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns highlighted by massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday and political instability from the withdrawal of the U.S. military have likely prevented U.S. oil companies, analysts said, from becoming more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude reserves in the world.
In some cases, U.S. companies were disadvantaged because competitors, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to be able to sign contracts with the Ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have been assisting with technical advice in recent years, have left empty.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the world economy as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its competitors and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies placed bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner killed in Pakistan
In an apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner is said to have been killed this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials reported on Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs allegedly killed, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials, by a number of missiles that met their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism representatives cited indefinite evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia has been described as the Al Qaeda’s leading military planner who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous and pointed to the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and turned them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalia had rapidly risen in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and had best ties to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death was confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The rate of drone attacks by the CIA has declined from an average of six operations a month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website run by a nonprofit.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
UN’s top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from office in March, ending a stormy term clouded by claims of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the increase in troops, but he also expressed concern that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is scheduled to begin in 18 months, could cause other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aides to help with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he did not quit his office, but only fulfill an agreement made to his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted to report to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to make a replacement.
What I said is that he'd better start looking for a successor, Eid said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has begun searching for a replacement, according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say that he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
Aid’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eid has rejected all allegations, but he also said that Galbraith's allegations -- who was fired -- "have undoubtedly harmed the mission, because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the US-led forces’ relief efforts in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries donating for the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in their money being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the restriction of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and should not continue like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran faces additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon be imposing “significant additional sanctions” on Iran for not having participated in talks about its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a 7-day voyage through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, playing down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options to choose, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that is on my mind is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, the unpredictability of war.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions may also affect the average Iranian.
He said a “package of positive and negative incentives” is needed “to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected with nuclear weapons” because “its people will suffer tremendously” from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the US government joined European leaders in warning that Iran must expect “credible” consequences if its nuclear program fails to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance organization, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should be gained only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and forgo a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran simply stopped the international community in relation to some proposals they had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “suppressive sanctions.”
In a New York statement, the Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called “baseless and unfounded claims” by some members of the Security Council on Iranian nuclear activities on Thursday, saying they were willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers “to achieve a suitable long-term solution.”
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. forces from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. Representative Gates, who told Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, “We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
Changes in ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that “Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children” and “A baby more means a grave more.”
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course due to the low birth rate and the ageing population this summer, encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: “No way.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, twisted single children, affectionately called "little emperors", is raising a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, according to the UN.
The Department of Population Issues is set to explosively increase the number of people aged 60 and older from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in wealthy coastal towns with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of childbearing age need to “help reduce the ratio of ageing populations and alleviate the labor shortage of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Anchored in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial order introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Married couples who violate this policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese officials have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of the natural resources of the country could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husbands and wives have been single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many hard slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Population Research, said government officials have recently debated even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a partner being a single child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city council has sent out municipal employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not particularly encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said there was a surge in the applications of couples who want a second child after the campaign started, the urban districts reported no change.
At the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are received per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the number of births expected in 2010 in the city will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to give their first one the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this is legal.
But, like many Chinese, they only have a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly rate one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others, and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it’s about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalist experiment and they don’t want such a life for themselves at all, he said.
Even a single child, he said, puts huge demands on the parents’ time.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the space question -- "You have to remodel your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a resume for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Drafts Emissions Reduction Plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- once again focused on Friday with the release of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialized nations having to face the biggest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final policy agreement on greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it has been seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that runs out as more than 100 top politicians from around the world arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a UN working group specifically for this purpose, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialized and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rise should be that policymakers would contribute.
The process is given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN’s leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big picture.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which industrialized nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave the talks a boost on Friday by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change – from overcoming floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday still brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had determined last week.
U.S. climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations calling for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not funded by industrialized nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration would be on a tougher line with China than it was with the Bush administration less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without larger emerging economies standing up and taking action, Stern said, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his statement an hour after China’s Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked “reason” or was “highly irresponsible” by him, saying earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China master global warming.
As the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, breaking lines have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle relates equally to saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the great powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of braking greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to take more aggressive action to hold countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will lead to a new economic dominance, according to Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the small island states’ offensive “exerts political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues still need to be clarified before the arrival of government leaders to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, escaped from their planes and rushed through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to set out claims to be negotiated during the next week.
The sheer size of the assembly -- 13,000 people go in and out of the congress center every day, guitar-playing activists are having nighttime shows in which they make fun of the countries they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are hand-to-hand instead of emailing -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: Almost all major ministers are here now and from Wednesday there will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the upper league, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global politics of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
UK’s first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m., a pipe will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h on its lightning trip from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lady Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become lively commuter cities, work time would be radically reduced, and the change from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the unavoidable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still catch the brakes on British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a January-based company to submit a feasibility study to the government, will submit the report to Lord Adonis, according to the Times on December 30.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which will connect London to the West Midlands, will run past urban areas and places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open space, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also expected to create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best-functioning option,” said a railway insider.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today just over an hour.
The designs offer trains the possibility to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned so that 400-metre-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can travel on it.
Up to 18 trains could operate per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that London would need a terminal that could handle 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes this plan should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it moves the wheels, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would keep the travel time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial bottleneck in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the railroad, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for 75,000 Pound Orangery mortgage from Conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading lower house member of the Conservatives, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built himself in his home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that lower-house members have to live “from lean rations,” has raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to get an oak-wood framework cultivation to build his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The leaders of the House of Commons approved the motions at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenditures of the House of Commons members. Last night, Duncan said the motions “could not have been cleaner or more comprehensible.”
Duncan, one of the wealthiest lower house members, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (EUR 1.1 million).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, a lower house spending control office, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he cultivated a conservatory called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Even during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges, Duncan was not asked to comment on the increased cash intake.
The Committee acquitted him last month after an investigation into his expenditure of breaking the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a 271,406-pound mortgage from his London house to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election to parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan received about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as a mortgage interest by March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage hasn’t changed during this time, suggesting that the entire increase served to finance the 75,000 pound (85,000 euros) cash withdrawal.
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The most recent documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim its entitlement to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the lower house in September after an undercover reporter filmed him in the process when he said after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live “from lean rations.”
“In essence, when you work for the state, it means you have to live on lean rations and be treated like shit.”
He said, “I spent my money on my garden and claim a substantively small portion, measured by what belongs to it.
And I could have claimed the whole damn amount, but I don't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May for his expenses when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this could be “considered as an exaggerated demand.”
An activist dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign in Duncan's lawn in protest after it became known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, “This had been approved by both the Fees Office and Legg to increase the value.”
He added: “There is no debate about dodging and meandering or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all you believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, filled with dried fruit pastries.
The selected Christmas songs to date are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the cottage decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and hold inspiring celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which was to lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chairman of the climate conference, the increasing global mobilization for climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, all dressed in black, had smashed showcases with paving stones and hammers, noted an AFP journalist.
Anti-unrest police officers intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that, according to their assessment, between 600 and 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in eastern France in April, these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested “without distinction,” underlining that about a hundred of them “were still held in the streets on Saturday evening,” despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in a sitting position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the envisaged speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters travelled with busts and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them with sky-blue raincoats, have made a first onset in Copenhagen in the morning as they have followed the call of Earth’s friends to form “blue tides” for “climate justice.”
Today, we are taking to the streets to demand a reparation of the ecological debt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry up, watercourses where you can walk, as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, the figure of the critics of globalisation, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for a different world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has launched the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted bandanas, in which you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a “coat”.
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "coat".
Approximately 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
Election turnout was around 58% a few hours before the polls closed, according to the Abkhazian Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including former president Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under a peaceful total occupation, his press spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, has explained.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this 216,000-inhabitant area, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia that is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating itself from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with thousands of people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to vote in an electoral venue that was in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes by the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small ceremony, in reference to the support of Moscow, especially regarding the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka in the process.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements made with Moscow last year, such as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia in control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of elections must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people have rallied around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, ready for action at all times, have arrested about 700 people on the verge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives delegates from 193 countries until December 18, looking for an agreement to come into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators, who were completely dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to hit slices, noted an AFP journalist.
Anti-unrest police officers immediately encircled you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the floor.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the “Blacks Blocs”, these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
Towards evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin by a pavement stone during the incidents, in which, according to police, about twenty people were temporarily arrested. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
“We have the extreme groups under control,” said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as the helicopters of the police circulated in the air.
Most of the protesters who travelled by train or by their own vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in a sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today, we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South,” said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can’t tell ourselves: we still have time,” says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP and globalisation critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, advertised solar energy before the city administration of the Philippine capital.
Hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, during the demonstrations organized by the "Net of 350", several hundred people gathered, especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strengthened by the school reform of the high schools.
The national education minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", that the subjects geography and history are strengthened from the school reform of the high schools, even if they are not compulsory in the terminals (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th year) now have all four hours of the week and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but on the whole a concentration "of the best students".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued, underlining: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceas."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) criticized the state project of deleting mandatory teaching in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminale S program.
Luc Chatel also defended educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) on Tuesday called for protest against the project, which they believe will be the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that in Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year they will undergo a subject-specific aptitude test and at the end of the year an admission test, during which their teaching skills will be examined.
In addition, they perform internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year in front of the students as teachers in the internship.
He continued, "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you'll reach even more hours spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister finally stated that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the work at the Copenhagen Summit : that is the challenge Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
We want to do something to reach people and to make them feel like they want to know more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the sidelines of the conference.
“Of the experts, around twenty participants were selected, also according to their charism,” he explains.
"You can talk for hours on climate warming, but the core goals can also be set in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of AFP, who spoke in front of about 50 people only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he underlined, hoping that audiences may infer that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next “Ernest” day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, actions planned
The prison officials’ unions called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime paid for budgetary reasons until January are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Prison Officers (“FO-Pénitentiaire”) urged employees who have no service to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and block them to draw attention to the “theft of what they are entitled to”.
The Third Union of Prisoners (“CGT-Pénitentiaire”) called for “a strong mobilization in the various prisons” in which the non-payment of October’s overtime, night surcharges, and December’s Sunday and holiday surcharges is branded as “disgraceful and unacceptable.”
The first union of prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime had increased sharply in 2009 and not all were planned in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
According to the Ministry of Justice, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of prison officials guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
“I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functioning and to modernize it,” the Justice Minister said in a statement.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate action so that such a situation, caused by a lack of assessment of overtime, does not repeat itself in the future," added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore low, except for the management staff, who are benefiting from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for whom the "budgetary constraints" must be met.
“This is an absolute scandal,” the interregional trade union FO in Marseilles revolts, announcing to boycott “all assemblies and convocations” up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours of October in December are still not paid. The same applies to their overtime hours," threatens the FO Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being cumbersome without hiring more staff, trying to enrich oneself with the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate," said the Bordeaux CGT trade union.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Francois Forget.
Obama believes that he is distributing Christmas better and better gifts than he gets himself.
American President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told TV talk master Oprah Winfrey that he is always distributing better gifts than he gets himself.
On a special show broadcast on ABC on Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the family's small four-legged companion, will be with the game.
“Santa Claus loves Bo too,” Michelle Obama reiterated, adding that the dog also receives a gift.
Michelle Obama resolutely rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts: “I gave you beautiful gifts last year,” she teased the president.
"Please," he invoked her insultingly, pointing to the first lady's pearl chain: "And who gave you this?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known TV presenter, whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama recalled a ten-speed bike and a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought to him from Kenya at Christmas.
“I remember when my father once visited us on Christmas and brought me a basketball,” the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized I had this ball from him.”
The first lady remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know at all how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday is operating again, RTL confirms he was put in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France, according to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer has been put in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, after American doctors found “damage resulting from the surgery of a herniated disc” he suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that these damages required a renewed operation.
The singer’s production company nevertheless wanted to clarify that the situation was “under control” and announced that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put in an artificial coma to avoid “pain and complications.”
However, only after 48 hours did they have a little more certainty about the patient’s condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources show" that "no drainage was laid" after his first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau for a herniated disc.
The procedure was planned over several days by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday evening.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend is walking through a "deep valley", but he assured that you "do not have to worry" about the rock musician, as he is "a good fighter".
"He called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was nonsense to sit on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer’s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday was “reacting well on the antibiotics” and that “the infection was contained.”
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he did not feel any particular concern.
Still, concern for the singer’s health had increased ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, there was talk of Johnny Hallyday having a “little bowel cancer surgery,” which led to a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented on extensively. Fans and journalists have not missed that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It wasn’t until mid-November that the people around him had to deny a re-entry to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday about his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 on the short-track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while one had expected a real record flood.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m positions and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m positions of the men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach for the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 seconds, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at the international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in something bigger and bigger, and in this case, I've said that if the world record is within my reach, I'll try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combination did not pay off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has won with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t get a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job.”
“Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future,” Biedermann said.
U.S. tombstone at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated to be worth $1.5 million on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the 3rd century AD and was always valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
“Four scenes of Dionysus in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchus figures, are a rare piece, and there are only four or five of them in the world,” said Florent Heintz, vice president of Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby’s.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
“Sales are still underway, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most so far,” Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "inheritance of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras to Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil incompatible after this leader had been rejected by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said Mexican Foreign Affairs Minister Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration agency, the plane provided by the Mexican government, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, had returned to its starting point.
The coup government wanted to force M. Zelaya to “abdicate” and ask for political asylum for him abroad.
However, the overthrown president declined to do so, wishing to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, incumbent head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered another failure by trying to get me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," Mr. Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for a good ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with the suggestion of some chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, which, unfortunately, we cannot accept, as it does not include a request for asylum, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not ask for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible exit from Honduras, he had underlined, would he only do as president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of M. Zelaya’s departure on Wednesday mobilized the supporters of the overthrown president, who had gone to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had intensified its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the coup government’s position.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a popular poll to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he had surprisingly returned on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be imprisoned for treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29th to replace M. Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the controversial election, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argennia or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had voted massively against M. Zelaya’s return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street on the rise, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the US trade balance testify to a price recovery of the United States stocks and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the numbers at stock market close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, dominated by technology, has risen from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor’s 500 index was credited with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotal on the premise that the market focuses only on “half-full glasses,” she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen in the past week against all expectations and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average of new job seekers over the past four weeks “has fallen to the low of the year,” stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year profitability of government bonds has increased to 3.482% compared to the 3.432% on Tuesday evening, and the 30-year profitability of bonds to 4.492% compared to the 4.408% on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of ruling partisans whistle out "ladies in white"
Several hundreds of Cuban power guerrillas on Thursday whistled out the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally, which temporarily detained a good dozen dissidents.
Around forty "ladies in white", wives or close political prisoners, were whipped in the open streets by government partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on the walk to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Soldiers!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "There live Fidel and Raul!", the authorized partisans chanted the dissidents with a raised fist.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the “ladies in white” had taken place in Havana on the eve, in which there were neither injuries nor arrests.
In the Havanna district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also went to the demonstration in the face of the International Human Rights Day on Thursday, were temporarily arrested by civilian police officers, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents, who were bent by the partisans of the government, to enter civilian vehicles using violence.
Temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" have organized an unauthorized march for the "please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number is around 200, according to the dissident list, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, which is run by a united party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Insane kills 80-year-old with a knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five other people on Friday late afternoon during business hours in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first data of the survey, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old with two knives due to previously unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, is according to a police syndicate in the hospital the consequences of his injuries.
At or in front of the same pharmacy, he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were seriously injured at the hospital, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger because, according to police sources, it appears that vital organs have been affected.
The pregnant woman has become sick as a result of the events and, according to a police source, she has been hospitalized in a "shock state".
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of both severely.
The scenario remained dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a representative of the Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried, according to the witness reports determined by the AFP, to curb the madman.
I saw a guy in his thirties with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn’t make it because the guy was well-built, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two city police officers, including their supervisor, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife stings, police said.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first aid position and noticed a gaping sore in the stomach area, told Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came, injured by cuts.
The state police have finally arrested the man who had no identification papers with him.
The prosecutor’s office of Nanterre has commissioned the district department of the crime police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case investigation.
The insane man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out that he is being taken to a nervous hospital.
According to another police source, it required six police officers to curb him at the police commission in Clichy, where he had been taken away.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the course of the act".
U.S. Attorney Polanski calls for cessation of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently on trial at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, the director of the “pianist,” denounced three court judges in the second district of California for gross litigation errors at the time of the trial in 1977.
I immediately demanded sentence-decision, M. Hummel explained, before adding that the conduct of the judge entrusted with the case at the time of the trial, Laurence Rittenband, “let one run coldly down one’s back.”
According to him, the judge Rittenband, who is now deceased, had discussed his judgment with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved a prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), specifically by the prosecutor David Wells in question.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had lied to the authors of the documentary.
If the Court refuses to terminate the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel demands the conduct of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence for his argument.
The indictment, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the removal of the charges against the defendant cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the U.S. in 1978 before the sentence was announced for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has not travelled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski “must be there to attend the trial.”
Would you like to spread the message in this matter and not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that escape is a way out?
In their opinion, “the filmmaker asks the Court for a favor and thus despises his authority.”
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even highlighted that “there are other alternatives to escape.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also demanded the annulment of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by every revival of the Polanski affair, adding: “No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months in prison, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and closes with no price.
The New York Stock Exchange ended Friday without a price in a market that was torn between better indicators than expected in the US and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has given off 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The Advanced Index Standard & Poor's 500 has increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is pretty quiet,” noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
“It remains narrowly limited, the trading volume has become very small and I think this will remain so until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than intended, which "have contributed to improving the market view to the solidity of the economy's recovery," summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, already two months in a row and far more than expected.
Furthermore, the confidence of American consumers has improved significantly in December to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan index preview.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar price, which has reached its highest level compared to the euro in two months, pushing down the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
Treasury bond yields over 10 years increased by 3,540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3,482%, and bond yields over 30 years rose to 4,497% compared to 4,492% the previous day.
Miss World's Election in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World will cross the final hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world and to do so in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the Johannesburg area, five of them have already entered the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected as Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their stay in Africa.
This was a true swirl of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was simply exceptional.
“I’ve seen a lot of things and had a lot of experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition takes place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday from 5 p.m. Central European time from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn’t imagine a more beautiful land to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underscored Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with female candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as to emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it’s every woman’s dream to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws Miss India in with a big smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
Candidates defile in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuits.
The performance will be presented by a TV presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beauty queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a Miss World committee officer, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with a warmth and pride that can hardly be surpassed, assures Julia Morley, chairman of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, did a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted by bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who handed them the hand, was quite exceptional.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Her most beautiful memory, however, undoubtedly remains the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) to the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote a little more for this event.
I’m dealing with people I’m probably never going to be able to approach.
I will definitely be back to the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi enthusiastically.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive” according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained David Hallyday to the press when he got off the plane, where he arrived from Paris shortly after 13 o’clock local time (21 o’clock CET).
The singer’s son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would “quickly” go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a disc incidence on November 26.
The singer was "put in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and perform his treatment," the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was transferred to an artificial coma by the doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was sent to Paris on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following a disc surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again in the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last procedure.
His wife, Laeticia, attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, in which her daughter Jade attends school, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Hospital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer has severely burdened the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told he had done the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
I’ve heard that you may be going to start a lawsuit, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "travelled far too quickly and this with the permission of the Parisian surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally spoke to this doctor, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me a lot, since I already have two intervertebral disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced on RTL that the singer apparently had left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer at the Medical Chamber, has described him as “a man without a scruples” who is “regularly” responsible before the board of directors and “everything else than recommended”.
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been “perfect” and the post-operative investigations would have been “normal.”
The operation "caused no bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been increasing since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is a bit too short for a continuation of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens), explained Mr. Camus.
The Party Alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) is getting energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre to stop using its seal
The party alliance, overseen by Francois Bayrou's MoDem party, responded violently on Friday to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, on the part of the leader of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, and urged him, under threat of legal prosecution, not to use that seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that Francois Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he handed over the left.
By the way, the defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy before the NC National Council on Saturday.
In reaffirmation of his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who is entitled to the ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to apply for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle".
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by Francois Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and set a deadline for the minister and the deputy, under threat of legal prosecution, to stop using this seal and transfer to it the property rights of the mark.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would suggest to your political movement to take over the UDF seal,+ wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You probably also thought you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF +, printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you are not entitled to use this seal, UDF’s office said, calling on NC to “immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material and from (your) website.”
In addition, Hervé de Charette "was required to transfer the property rights of the brand to her legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will sue you to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and remind that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave this 2007 to found a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to found the party "UMP".
According to the signatories, the Nouveau Centre party therefore has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie frenchaise).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of a branch for the defence of the “material and moral interests” of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing.
As regards Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "he had not been a member of the UDF for three years at the time he applied for the brand name" but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
You also point out that this recklessness is on the way to turning into a crime, ironizing the NC’s strategy: “It seems more dignified to us both in politics and in life to make a name for ourselves, rather than trying to get out of anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name to which you have no legal claims at all.”
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : Francois-Marie Banier convicted of exploitation of weakness
On Friday, the Court of Nanterre decided to judge the artist Francois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to sneak up on part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will face trial on 15 and 16 April 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter cough each other while at the same time holding the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is jointly carried out by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L’Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions presented by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office.
The doctors appointed on Friday should present a report before March 10, 2010, in which they clearly state whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will speak to her, Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Ms. Georges Kiejman, said after the trial.
As far as the lawyer of Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, is concerned, he is very pleased with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against Francois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years to steal donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she regarded as a long-time friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ plaidoyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer invoked three letters (1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary by his client, in which she wrote that she distrusted the husband of Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: “Can you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
“I have never been able to speak to Francoise since she got married.”
The Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre once again believes that the plaintiff had no right to respond in this way, especially because a guardianship judge in recent days has rejected her request to initiate a judicial protection proceeding against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the public prosecutor.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the trial of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-a-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined to impose the best as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the enterprises, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the local markets ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separately factors preferences of the customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to lethal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that particularly affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D, which is even more crucial, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) calls for "a proactive approach and a forward-looking view of all parties involved"; it claims from employees an effort that is completely contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would be to put the employees at the center of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with the customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to its payees, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that in the face of a new situation, after many detours, the whole structure finally comes to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a much simplified idea of human behavior.
Originating from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt through intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by the U.S. “neurosciences” and unknowingly widespread by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to actuate the “lever” (sic) of employee engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos, published in Le Figaro.fr, reinforces leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for the payees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears to be a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions and intentions.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predefined doxa, which allows them to estimate through their perceived image of the company, what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the leaders of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo Speech: The 'Just War' Brings Obama Praise from the Right
American right-wingers welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday and were satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had mocked the award to Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, following the example of former Vice Presidential Candidate in the 2008 elections, Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself raised the issue of a “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs just published.
“The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, made an effort to justify the use of force in Oslo on Thursday; a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, was of the opinion that the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, cheered the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I have found this speech to be quite historical, Ginrich explained, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, considered by some to be a potential candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, said he was pleased to have seen a “left-wing president” who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that “they are not free and could not win a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist.”
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “cosmopolitan,” as “he always does,” he “spoke like an American president” when he pointed out that Europeans “live like a safety bubble they didn’t create themselves and don’t do much to protect,” Gerson said.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, a Bush falcon, described the speech on the National Review Online website as “boring, upbeat and uninspired.”
On the left of the president, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama is defending his recourse to the armed forces.
If you pack the war under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocent can easily be justified, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left continues to be praised by the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, called the speech itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a timetable for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and describes his speech as “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Long-distance driver: Three marathons for an agreement to secure Christmas supply
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the road unions and the TLF – the only employers’ organisation that remained until the end – reached an agreement on Friday evening that puts an end to the strike order and the impending severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State responsible for transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiating night, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in hopes of swiftly signing the agreement in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the agreement was concluded, and the agreement was not signed until 18:00 a.m.
The conflict "would have done a lot of harm to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages therefore rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
“That’s not much, but we’re starting small,” Patrice Clos said.
The activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some rebellious people who are not satisfied with the agreement," he added.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good deal", although it was "difficult to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
“This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees,” said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of “an historic agreement.”
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase of 3% in travel costs and the maintenance of the total road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will allow, in particular, to address the issue of 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the lowering of taxes for employers of 100 million euros" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the bill of 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for an “identical” vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to that organisation and then to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case “in the shortest possible time,” Bussereau insured.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The FNTR denounced “fraudulent trade” because the 100 million euros “were already promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to drown the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, complains Unostra.
For the Otre Association, the agreement threatens “to shovel a large grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months.”
Line RER A: Disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, France’s largest high-speed rail network for the Paris and Ile-de-France area, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Parisian Passenger Transportation Administration) continues to wait for the strikers with their demands for wage surcharges.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for use and outside the central route only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the passengers to change trains.
The department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is making an effort to connect the big shops by transport".
The RER A line passes through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the villages of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one out of two trains ran according to schedule at peak time, and almost none during low-traffic time.
As on Thursday, there was no human turmoil on the platforms, as the inhabitants of Ile-de-France had adapted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), engineer Jack Nbakina (29) stated that he had “standed up an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time.”
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of travellers by officials and law enforcement, pointed out that there had been no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line from or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the Saint-Lazare station to ensure connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, there were once again general meetings of the strikers, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific preparation of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-due wage supplement.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself puts its salary supplement proposals in brackets, stressing that the leadership “is not able to solve a problem, while this was possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF.”
The RATP made it clear that a re-meeting for the “comprehensive examination of working conditions” is planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership that so far rejected any discussion during the strike, suggesting a meeting after calming the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after an announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations charge a wage surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced Friday the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party, a decision immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to greatly complicate the government’s work, which seeks to give the Kurdish community the hand to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The “Party for a Democratic Society” (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a “place of activity detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” according to the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kilic four days after the decision to the press.
The decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the dissolution, and recalled that 37 of the party’s leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political action for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party’s assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in the parliament (out of 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders said that parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than meet like non-partisan parliamentarians.
The decision followed a process initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalsinkaya, accusing the DTP of following the “proofs” of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and numerous other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party claims to have “no connection” to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court appeals to the government, which seeks to accommodate the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to drain the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of the PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP’s premises in the million-dollar town of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The police used tear gas grenades and water cannons when the protesters began throwing molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court’s decision “will deepen the despair even further.”
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, editorial) question on the basis of the ban on a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We oppose the closure of the parties in principle.
That doesn’t solve the problems,” said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
“This decision is torpedoing the democratic opening promoted by the government,” Ahmet Island, a political market observer, said in a statement.
“You can obviously get ready for a reaction from the PKK,” he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK confessed to an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow can come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
But so that his employees can try out and master the entire vehicle technology.
This weekend, meteorologists say, could be the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES follows an exact plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are covered by large-scale scattering vehicles, Brauburger explains.
These include main roads and through roads such as the Neue Straße and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire services, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES starts at three in the morning
The approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That is why the FES starts at three at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then nobody is willing to make room for the scattering vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow any further, are feeder and development roads, which includes the Rat-Beil-Straße, its turn.
The last priority are side roads and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians set out on their way, priority being given to clearing hazardous points and transitions.
The FES usually can’t care about all the cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30, Brauburger says.
Since there is fast smoothness on these, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the move.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-sized animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body features, Sterling Nesbitt from the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues reported in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about the relationship, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
Over the course of the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find Confirms Theories of Dino Early History
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurus fossils from the Trias are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur-Dinos is often controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithopause.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of airbags, such as the offspring of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of the mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, Randall Irmis says.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also had airbags and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America over all continents, which at that time still formed a single landmass as a supercontinent of Pangea.
The fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
There are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says the Bonn palaeontologist Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted picture, because in South America there are simply a lot of primitive dino fossils, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare lateral line of the reptile strain to the dominant agricultural vertebrate of the Earth Age is still enigmatic.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flight acids, and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the kinship died out on the border from the Triassic to the Jura.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to flower, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then had a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto insist on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The eviction of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University by police strikes waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are joining forces with the protesting students on the Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike in the past week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police commando".
The eviction constitutes an “unacceptable interference” in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "deligitimize and criminalize the protest" and distract from the content.
The Bureau had withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the property damage, it said.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi State Youth Secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessian Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the actions of the Unipräsident and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in an hour on Thursday in Wiesbaden state parliament.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and the Left saw this differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of addressing the students’ arguments and demands, they were cleared.
The left has submitted a motion calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded site for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered a "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning deputy Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research center will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is home to major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Engineering, the major corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaya Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist plan city" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the lowering of a train station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg’s state capital for a decade into helpless construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 originated from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered 19th-century transport fossils, which acted as brake pads of modern rail transport, as it once took an enormous amount of time to stretch locomotives from the back to the front.
Keep going, keep going, keep going - that's how it's supposed to be.
And that is why the top stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station that is located about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that's why the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is actually being tackled now, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals to implement lowering.
However, head train stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern reversing trains with railcars and control wagons at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 along with the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being tackled.
Local and regional politicians have done so.
The railway is involved, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic are borne by the taxpayers and not by the state group.
In terms of urban planning, the project can still be justified to some extent.
A new urban space is being created, which - according to the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger traffic, to which - typically in the 1980s - huge growth was attributed.
At that time, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than road transport.
But the new construction track is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy climbs.
What is even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros are to be spent in Swabian.
This is the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and constraints on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been built at slow pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley Route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines verdict on the airport
The state government has left open in Wiesbaden state parliament, whether it will go against the judgment of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in revision.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally examined, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
On this day, the VGH in Kassel had justified in writing that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 p.m., as stipulated by the state government, is not compatible with the legally required protection of the population against night flight noise.
The coalition has to decide by January 4 whether to go against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this delay and urged the representatives of the government to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged CDU and FDP to return to their promises before the election for a night flight ban, otherwise this would be considered a “word break”.
It is damn hard to keep his word, said Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir in allusion to the FDP election slogan “We keep word”.
Minister Posch rejected the allegation of Schäfer-Gumbel, the state government trying to come to its night flights with "right-wing twisting and trickery".
A thorough legal examination takes your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a “quick first impression”.
We need a legal decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition put it, his faction’s statements on the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. Banks Pay Back Aid
Crisis-shaking U.S. banks are stripping off their state bonds.
The Bank of America on Wednesday paid back the aid from the Tarp bank bailout fund in the amount of a total of 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) in one blow.
And the Citigroup is also planning to reimburse state aid, according to a report by the US channel CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that came with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had worried about convertible bonds in excess of $19 billion in fresh money from investors.
The rest of the sum she took from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by division sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday evening expressly thanked the American taxpayer: The money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to exempt itself from its liabilities to the state.
Already on Thursday, the US bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Quick choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Less than two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the staff.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin, was considered a favorite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, a role should also have played in not further damaging the ZDF director Markus Schächter, this proposal should not come through with the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The outcome of the vote was not yet clear at the end of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed in the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, and seven voted against him. Brender's election was a hard defeat for Schächter.
Because the majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch had been organized.
With the argument that under Brender, the ZDF news broadcasts had lost ratings, he declined another term of the high-profile editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
Lastly, even 35 state rights activists had interfered in the debate, who considered Koch’s actions to be unconstitutional.
It was useless.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Afterwards he worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the "today-journal".
Subsequent posts: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "morning magazine"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after Brender’s election, which was still voted journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart on the board, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF state treaty in such a way that staff proposals by the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an extract of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also excluded Beck.
Brender’s prospective successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the Board of Directors with a clever move – by strongly criticizing the panel immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both Schächter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief and to elect the board of directors without suspecting the appointment of a party-goer.
In party arithmetic, Frey is attributed to the left liberals anyway.
Study is being defused
Partial success for the students: After a year of educational strikes, the ministers of culture of the countries finally decided on Thursday: At a meeting of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should also be able to manage their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: In principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students should be checked and "a realistic and acceptable measure" ensured.
Politicians and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s programmes more flexible.
In addition, there should be no country regulations that differ from this.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university rectors have been saying the winged word of better studyability in the mouth.
For the first time, it was filled with a specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to partially drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module usually concludes with only one exam," says a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of study programs.
With the "significant reduction of the audit burden," said the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "misdevelopment should be stopped, which significantly impaired studyability."
In addition, "studyability" should in future be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content should be "strengthened to check" whether "unnecessary student constraints in the choice of
“Events” would be avoided.
The students would have “claim to receive leeway that allows and promotes initiative.”
The rules should apply to the admission of new, but also to the review of existing courses of study.
These must be “reaccredited” every five years – which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all degree programs to be reviewed.
This is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies nationwide, which are under the accreditation council established by the countries.
In October, the ministers of culture had urged the countries to act on the agencies in such a way that the substance supply was not too large and the examination regime was not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funding for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities are mainly to set up tutoring programs and strengthen student counselling as well as examination and foreign offices.
Country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce a amendment to the university law in Parliament.
After this, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to make the study design more flexible, to ensure recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all study programs in the country will be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again argued about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso University Groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place in the future "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students as affected should now also "speak a word".
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors’ Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: “We need the experiences of the students,” she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The union Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor's degree access to a further master's degree.
On the other hand, the countries have to ensure that there are sufficient Master’s positions with the best possible study conditions for today’s generation of undergraduate students tomorrow, according to GEW Board Member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire more teachers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on a freer access to the master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and going out is almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he deals with the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, had initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a editor in a children's book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
In 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurter Poetikvorlesungen at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, during a conference in Munich, he caused considerable extra-literary arousal, which focused on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorted mirror of its securitate records".
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he acknowledged his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate before Romanian German writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the participants, Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had begun creepyly, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "someone who has not fought enough against attempts at securitization."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary engagement with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that identifies the abyss and disguise of a political system based on surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from his previous knowledge, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file IM Walter had played a role, said after the confession of Söllner the literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He had "cut it out" in all the difficult points for him at the time, Markel said.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner’s statement was in the form and before this audience unexpected, but completely surprising is not the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate spikes, Herta Müller had already written in July, after reading her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one may suspect, will have speculated and in some cases probably also known which clear name was hidden behind the surnames Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
Unlike in the case of the now very procedurally reliable sighting of the Stasi files, the handling of the legacy of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic education has been undermined and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the Preparation of the Securitate Files (CNSAS) was established only in 1999, but the publication of the files has since been rather sluggish.
Only since 2005 has there been a law regulating the administration of the files.
That the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very great, proved after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller an interview in which a former Securitate boss from Temesvar expressed a disparaging opinion about the laureate.
She has a psychosis, after all, she has only been interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with hidden guilt, is linked to inevitable questions.
The prudent reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge to know rather than by guilt and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who accepted the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Supplement Champions League
It seemed as if an adrettly dressed field serviceman had just come from a very nice Christmas party, on which a sports goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, climbed into a called-up C-class a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive baldness let himself be chauffeured because of the city still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven on his own – after all, alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with luck either.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or really go.
In the words of the Swiss committed only three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the descent."
The “much more important task” is ahead of us on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the performance in the league everyday in Mainz.
And to eliminate the weaknesses revealed again after the quick three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Drawing
The Champions League's eighth final (Hinspiele 16/17. + 23/24 February / Rückspiele 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
So the joy of the Babbel successor’s fulminant stand remained modest.
Not only with the supposed Saviour, who had given the unsettled Stuttgart professionals confidence, commitment and joy in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to reflect on their strengths, and I encouraged them to be more courageous, soul plumber Gross explained the simple-sounding recipe for success, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked a certain magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury break thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the observed "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the workings of the new supervisor: "He is a man who takes action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet above the mountain, warns sports board member Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart especially needs consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful not to overestimate the victory against a replacement weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen the evil awakening had come, Khedira admitted.
And sports board member Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That Heldt was not happy on his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which revived in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had shown leadership weakness to the board and decided to change coaches due to pressure from puberting fans.
Lehmann also considered that his free day had been cancelled after games as a sign of lack of sovereignty and displeasure.
Lehmann’s statements were “ridden by pure selfishness,” Heldt wedged back, announcing consequences for the concluding man.
They will no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with all the others that without the preparatory work by the detached coaching team the playful and combatively strong imagination would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large part in the success," said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Cup fight in heavyweight
Heaty duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judge's verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the association WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points in the night to Saturday in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian was already twice World Champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out with the co.o., which everyone was expecting.
Klitschko built his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to face the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02-metre-tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight with his left-handed leader.
The eleven centimeter smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly escaped the beats of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and just tried to get over the laps.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his beatings rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
The challenger had caused some swirls before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an “ugly zombie” who “can’t do anything right.”
When weighing, the champion was provoked on Friday to push Johnson’s sunglasses off his nose “to see his eyes.”
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and got back his "WBC" belt, which he had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
I got only one blow in this fight and I am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-metre-large Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had earlier this summer canceled a battle planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
Its PhD company is already planning the fight against Klitschko in London’s Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green faction leader Jürgen Trittin has called defense minister Guttenberg a liar because of false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the left are demanding information from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition's defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has deliberately misled.
The minister had said about the deadly bombing on two tank trucks of September "knowingly the untruth," said Greens' leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
This is commonly called a lie.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had, Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped vices, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed or injured, according to NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak in front of the Bundestag immediately and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel has to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the German government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not have any influence on concrete operations of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the ministry’s presentation about the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert had also been raised.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs correctly and fully informed about the background of the tank truck attack.
Officially, it had said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, the two top officials said they even pointed out several reports to the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document from commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this will be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to constitute itself on Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see images in waking state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only in mentally ill people and drug abuse, the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are allowed to indulge ourselves uninhibited in the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike states while awake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or addicted to drugs in the modern Western world, at least as a peculiarity.
But such images and voices do not only arise in mentally ill people or in drug abuse.
Our imagination is at fault: the same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality.
Dreamlikely altered waking states can occur in various forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic withdrawal states, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of neuronal messengers of the brain - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very frequently during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no more power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of the dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great resemblance of being erased with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, sensory illusions of such a".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. is transformed into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky.
Gravity has no more power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted fractures, teeth squirting.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over the body.
Loud, vicious voices roar out of walls and radio.
He can no longer stand them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of the stereo, kneads them into a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets up on a speaker and puts the snare around his neck.
Jump.
The snare is loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices scream in a drumskin-fetching choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressed, he takes drugs, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common condition after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can no longer distinguish between the inside and outside world, they get into an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Particularly common is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the doors to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of what is happening, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time he gets into a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenia often feels threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible for them, the illusions are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Have experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles still puzzles researchers.
Exceptional states can cause any person to lose the relationship to reality for a short time, Fuchs says.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how the disorder of the neural system occurs, which at first does not manifest itself for many years at all.
Environmental influences also play a role – stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis when the disposition is present.
Even hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which ones, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether false images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The unreal world in our heads".
Hallucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of astonishingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and cranial trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory contents that are normally held back.
They occur when areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or under-inhibited; when our brain is running hot or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also deprivation of stimulus, stress, heartache or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said they experienced hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old and lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A normal girl, actually.
If only there were no pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a sloppy boy with long, dark hair will respond.
When it answers, the classmates look at it as a surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other deceptions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening
Often the false images are also a burden.
When she is in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material because the teacher is presenting a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while explaining mathematical equations visibly on the board for everyone else.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the shapes.
Parents and friends don’t tell them about it, they think they’re crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she got in touch with the psychologist Kasten on the internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art of despair
If a person is socially isolated or suffers from deprivation of stimulus, he is very likely to have hallucinations after a while, Kasten says.
I suspect the brain is then under-occupied and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she called Daddy since she can remember is not her biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to distinguish between false images and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they look so real."
Even nocturnal dream pictures consider boxing as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their illusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
The boundary between dream and hallucination
In our overly conscious world, imaginary experience is unfortunately usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience form, a special form of traumatically altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self-destruction and world loss, for example, by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with an imaginary world that is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning and meaning in an intolerable situation, which allows us humans to design our own ability not to perish in nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue action of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to motionlessness in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immerses himself in a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make intoxicants from blood.
Deported by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely into the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
Dream is another state, it describes its experience.
In contrast, memories from mental journeys are still clear to me after years and in minor details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience transcends the horizon of our other worldly experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug rush show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in waking.
Any change in the state of consciousness, concludes the psychologist box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publishing director Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to belong to 100% of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm desire to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have precautionarily regulated the details.
The question of whether they are active in the company only arises afterwards.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to introduce 7,500 employees to their children if they are not sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would retire from the Executive Board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was responsible for technology.
Later, with the Treasury division, the responsibility for the company's assets was added and after the retirement of Jürgen Todenhöfer also those for direct marketing, abroad, pressure and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of balds also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe before the demise: "This always affected families who were infected by a capital addiction, who were completely speculated and thought they could rise to become a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He has never had “world power dreams,” according to Burda.
I don’t see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with Time in the world league either, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least that’s what El Corte Inglés has set out to do, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is all about personal care.
In the spa, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find among other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide a depilation with laser; Spaxión, with rooms to relax and for beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its teahouse with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to set up your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, but there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are completely enough to train the body muscles.
And then, if you want to visit the hair salon after you have exercised your body, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments are offered in a personalized way to regain the beauty, shine and health of your hair.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer, which is why it’s a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the cleavage, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points to consider.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
Together with the city of Barcelona, Endesa has created the "LIVE Office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is currently being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and measures of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 “Electric Cities”
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those activities that are related to energy and, in particular, its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardisation groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a horizon of calm” for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, prophesies the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm".
In presenting the 2009 economic report by the government president, Zapatero recalled the measures the government has taken to support the automotive sector over the course of the year of government.
"Without the competitiveness plan for the automotive industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants today," he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automakers to continue producing in Spain in a highly competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry,” he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has allocated EUR 800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's efforts to boost demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the Prime Minister, this plan allows emissions to be reduced by 6% on average for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, resulting in a “strong increase” in approvals, which increased “by 40%” in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classical Automobile Fair is held in Madrid, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will present their brands on an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters.
Not only can you admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all the only articles related to the world of engines at ClassicAuto Madrid.
For example, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc. at the exhibitors at the trade fair.
Hundreds of items from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and lovers.
Among the companies that will participate in this fair are, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of automobiles specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests in the field

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially set up race track in the exterior area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is perfectly compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start system of the engine, named i-Stop, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out for its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All of these aspects are "very good" with the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, one can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the play of the steering wheel is excellent.
Further looking at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and dashboard, one can see that Mazda is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more comfort than ever before, so that four adults can drive comfortably.
All of this comes with a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearbox.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out because of its fineness, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who don’t drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-Stop with gasoline engine because of its great comfort in gearshift and low consumption, even if Mazda’s diesel models are the best-selling ones.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The standard equipment above all stands out from the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio bluetooths 17 and the chrome.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
Furthermore, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the test model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving fun every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shone more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without a way to see certain attachments or surf the internet.
It has enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is still of interest, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the company’s success with it, it launched two new devices: one designed only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, quite unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, however, has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to read all the small print.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside your own country you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it’s always amazing that it’s called Fon, even though it doesn’t have Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi) can offer these types of rates means that phone providers need to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include the download of books and other inquiries on the Internet.
Without sticks and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely when you buy, and not month after month.
And that’s exactly what I expect one day from FonPeek, a purchase option with lifelong internet access as the Peek already offers in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American first lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as president of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and re-chosen the same color to accompany him at his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric - and she wore something big-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the type of fabric they are made of.
At the inauguration she wore a lace dress and in Oslo a patterned velvet dress.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a similar model, but gold-coloured.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, the previous one she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women on the fertility and career of women in Spain.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, only work half-days or do not have a fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a permanent job, especially in the public sector, postpone the creation of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a permanent job have their first child on average only 3.7 years after moving in, a figure that increases to 4.1 years for women with a permanent job who have taken longer to achieve this and who have only pulled in and realized the first child much later.
Furthermore, the type of work has a major impact on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of conception," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account at the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference was also seen in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they had only primary school or higher education, on average, each became mothers with 25.1 or 32.1 for the first time.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with a master’s degree get married before their first permanent employment and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree do it exactly the other way around and look for a permanent employment and marry afterwards and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its ever envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The lead actress from Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will become another famous figurehead like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's acting colleague in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to speak in the fashion world.
Her highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On that occasion, they all appeared.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of this year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, images by Fernando Vicente) to the three x-rays of writers who accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
In doing so, he does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks a resemblance to the burning heart of the creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on horror or enlightenment.
Except that this book is a delicious read, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
"When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: joy in contrast to evil destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between fainting and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: “Our husband was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in getting to heaven on the detour of corruption.”
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published by Sylvia Beach in Paris in 1922. It is one of the 8000's peaks in the world's literature, you have to climb up on the north wall, on the wall where the best mountaineers try again and again.
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny gossip.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county, and other times he said he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams testified to a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer picked up the insane scream that was screamed from a bridge from Munich, so that his echo echoed into the night of the twentieth century in his literary way, during a journey in which he fled from himself and begged for posterity with a speech full of violence before the worms.
Dorothy Parker: “One day she kneeled down and prayed, ‘My dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman.’
On his grave are engraved these verses by Spencer: 'sleep after the effort, / after the thunderstorm the harbor, / the peace after the war, / after a rich life one finds delight in death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depression in her baggage.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azalea or that the birds were singing in Greek.
Not a single other case is known where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was far greater than her madness.
About P. Baroja: "What else did Martan-Santos do than to try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What, then, was Benet’s intention if he did not bring Baroja to Faulkner’s weapons?
What, then, did Cela, besides destroying that man's fame, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age ran out next to her and our dog, our dog is a hybrid that we brought out of the shelter and weighs just six kilos, and then from the bright sky they missed him two footsteps and injured him severely with it.
Our indignation cannot be put into words at all, since it is incomprehensible to us where the fun of an inexpensive aggression against a small and helpless animal is supposed to be, of course, carried out on a leash.
Add to that the suffocational seizure that a woman who went for a leisurely walk got when she wanted to rebuke these people on account of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older gentleman, or probably even with anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything about and in order to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We don’t know where the good upbringing and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies today announced.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of using the helmet, as it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment in terms of road safety, which "encompasses far more than just designing and manufacturing products that become safer and safer every day" and further reiterated that they also contribute with other actions of educational and informative character to bring this goal one step closer every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is “a constant concern” of the company, and precisely because, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to the fact that one of their main goals must be the development of ever safer products.
Sales of small trucks are rising again
After almost two years, the van market is finally starting to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% with respect to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase ever after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Manufacturers’ Association Anfac and the Ganvam Car Dealer Association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it should be noted that, apart from the increase last month, the total registrations for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous fiscal year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold since January, but this number includes all vehicles that make up the van market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter small trucks/chassis.
Furthermore, there are still the same thunderstorm clouds in the sky that affect demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
In addition to these restrictions, which are the result of the tightening of credit institutions, other factors must be included, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support has helped little when purchasing a vehicle of Plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to it if they want to buy a van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions that cannot exceed 160 grams per mile driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam had reminded the state that it is absolutely necessary to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealership association predicts a similar year for 2010 to the previous one, for which it expects a sales loss (for passenger cars and off-road cars) of 19%.
Support for braking maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the anti-lock braking system ABS and as with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergencies must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already compulsory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the rest of the vehicles a caring period was set until the end of February 2011.
The European Union's decision is aimed at improving the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many crashes due to their working methods.
The object of the emergency braking assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver which the system detects on the brake pedal on the basis of the braking strength executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to step on the brake pedal before the collision and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, engages with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking operation.
According to a study by the EU, every year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
The vehicle is then equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver responds, the system helps him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones Opel plans until January
While the workforce at the Opel plant in Figueruelas, Zaragoza, has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on April 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it needs more time to complete the Opel rescue plan.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants the affected party to give their approval on every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, the final document submitted first to the workers, and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, may be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, is assured that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also likes to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of Skyper sports cars, who has support from the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
If none of these buyers came to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their newest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now only weighs 1,275 kilos.
To create something like this, they first did not use the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent canopy with manual drive, so that only one saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model like the GT3 "disappear" another 15; due to the removal of the air conditioner again 13; furthermore, the fuel tank has been slightly reduced by 7 kilos from 64 to 54 liters.
Then, by dispensing with the CDR-30 audio system, six kilos less and by replacing the door handles with fabric handles, the missing kilo was reached.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller California land roads, on mountain tracks that were really very winding.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the grade impeccable.
However, the reduction in his weight did not mean that he would no longer be so safe on the street.
The opposite is the case: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, which at the same time gives you a sense of great safety in the corners, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time, until we give him the commands to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been extremely successful and can be increased with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The accelerator is unimaginably brutal, whether standing out or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the punch holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that even though we found ice in the morning at some of these curves.
To sum up, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it would otherwise rather rarely exist, and it contains much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl
The singer, a bust friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and a casual star at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same throatfastness as her bags of Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Basconia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many fancy players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes in first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was at eight triple the best of his team (29 in the rating).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the major failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great scores from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Reds, who sat at the top of the display board from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it could already be guessed that they had come to the playing field with well-heated wrists.
They were English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly any different, except that the team from Alava opted for Barac’s internal game and for Eliyahu’s game, which was received with whistles and applause on his return to the team, which is his home to continue expanding their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggests that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was far from decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the constantly attacking "Hand of Elias" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a key role in turning the "yellows" over the helm (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few hits with certainty to get back air and one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas could ensure that on the ad board was displayed again calming distance from (54-67) with the third (54-67) of the host at the end.
The Alavesen were bloomed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team three points off the line again (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was put off due to fouls, Ivanovic’s team did not give up, defended well, and although the Israelis were still catching up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being confronted
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and had to cede the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, in a game characterized by the failures on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The team from Malaga was not afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their first-quarter game, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, even though the indigenous team with an internal match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the ad board in their favor in the 13th minute 22-20, the minute when it would have come to almost a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and therefore both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally began to warm up and his superiority in both halves of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left a clear mark on Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian protagonist Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, proved to be superior and even managed to compensate for the difference in the game played in Málaga by 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to sway.
Unicaja tried to overcome the many failures and the departure of the injured Scot Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to the spring guidance and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis, some hope came back to 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, since the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority by centimeters within the basket area, could not be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give himself up and had to cede the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn on Facebook due to your profile?
Facebook users can now find out their salary based on their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, jobs and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users using more than 140,000 jobs available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter their profession, work experience, age and the city they work in.
Already after a week, after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker, on average, “feels badly paid,” explains Albert Ribera, who is responsible for the product Trovit, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the least paid according to the data that Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a French 31,059, unlike the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 euros in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual net of 11,592 euros; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social worker.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in her embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President who has been removed from office must leave the diplomatic representation by 27 January 2010 at the latest, if his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows" that he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum before this date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on that day and he has to look for a new place to stay."
The broadcaster also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the set date: “My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil,” Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on November 29 (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged victorious), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy by January.
However, this week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
However, this failed due to Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the “de facto” government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned in the markets, which is by no means surprising as this is their natural state, in an environment in which brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilise markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and, indirectly, to leave liquidity free hand at interest rates moving around zero so that banks could buy assets for settlement.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost complete and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to sprinkle some sand in the gear, as BCE näc already suggested with its annual auction next week.
That is why investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still a long way from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and sovereign debts were rising again.
Quality is now back in place and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone in terms of Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability so far, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new review of Spain's valuation.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral risk who had once again tried to raise awareness among those responsible for world economic policy about what they had caused, as they had slowed down the devastating effects that restricting loans led to the loss of jobs when they were supposed to conclude a new day of thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the emirs to restore power in the emirates, and development in Greece has been foreseen earlier.
A government that keeps the government in debt, elections and a new government that pulls on the same line.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Duro Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin will save Hungary from failing to fulfil its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, thus allowing a euro member country to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account when it comes to the need for exceptional measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, before an episode of risk premium normalization, after some debauchery on too high amounts, that would now be within the expected range.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences are reduced and the Spanish increase further, this would be a special Spanish risk.
This is a farce for Standard & Poor's. While the preferred indicators here force a majority of market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and correct their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which are back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all of this, despite warnings, does not promise a long lifespan.
Once again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "caution when driving" is required.
Connected branches
Iberdrola’s chairman, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before the Parliament’s subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy for Spain’s energy supply will be debated these days over the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some pitfalls about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest €50 billion by 2020 and an additional €60 billion from that date until 2030, on the condition that the current nuclear power plants remain operational.
If this is not the case, the investment required would not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
As of 2020, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for collecting carbon dioxide and, of course, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the prerequisiteof course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft law for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything about this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all policy strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, one is clearly setting in this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola described them.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that the decisions on investments, even if they are long-term, should be made right now, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
The subsidiary of Ferrovial for services at airports on the ground, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have been announced, is planned for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol yesterday to cooperate to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the study of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are his competitors.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city council wants to complete the construction by the end of 2014.
After the administration had opted for a public-private collaboration (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll station management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing with each other in the final phase.
The group called Transcity is headed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia’s largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O’Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures, and the French Bouygues consortium, will compete against the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium in the shortlist is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatizations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as access is only possible through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of utmost importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The subterranean toll route, which will be funded by the City of Brisbane’s Infrastructure Office and named Northern Link (North Feeder), is intended to connect the western motorway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) over a length of 5 kilometers through tunnels, which is the largest measure to reduce congestion on the streets of Brisbane.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll route is expected to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, construction work is expected to continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex vent system.
The government of Queensland is investing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) in the financing.
Brisbane is already a big business for Hochtief.
Australia repeatedly awards substantial orders to Hochtief, who signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday.
The ACS subsidiary will use its local subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables.
This improvement will provide fast Internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the 27-storey King George Tower project in the Australian city of Brisbane, the construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million for it.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools over 25 years.
Initial investments amount to 75 million euros.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has acquired through its subsidiary Alpine, the construction of a tunnel over 2.1 kilometers in length for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the contract for the construction of the extension of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnelling.
Construction work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and its implementation will last more than 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising bill from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros per year, the railway company said.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies presenting this contest advertised by Renfe, of which 4 came to the final round, including TBWA, which was responsible for the advertising over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be tasked with designing and manufacturing the campaigns.
Punishment over 63 million for France Télécom for braking off the competition.
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the country’s Caribbean territories.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on landlines and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, price plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state enterprise has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The sentence imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that watches over the competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company followed the example of other telephone providers and opened an application trading site on the Internet in order to increase revenues from transactions not derived from the telephone connection.
Basically, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until this site will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League match has earned Madrid and Barca 476.4 million since the start.
Since its creation in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of income for the football clubs.
So much so that since then, Real Madrid and Barcelona have raised 476.4 million, earning them third and fifth place among the football clubs that earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) who have participated in this event since its inception in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has made the most money through its participation and the only one besides AC Milan who has won the trophy three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup 1992 takes fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money by participating in the past Champoins League.
And that even though they lost to Baria.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to win money through the Champions, although it has more titles than everyone else (five, unlike four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated granting procedure used by UEFA.
In this fiscal year, the organization, whose chairman is Michel Platini, expects to receive revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the pre-qualification round (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who competed received 3.8 million due to their sheer presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they competed in.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have reached the eighth finals each receive three million; the four that have reached the quarter finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns $9 million, unlike the second, which receives $5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed revenue.
Barca, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is given proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 places allocated.
The champion of last year receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part is distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa Offers $61 Million for 29.9% Share in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details yesterday about the offer to buy shares, with which it intends to acquire a cap between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers 1,5025 euros per share, which are paid out for ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually as a result of this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a 15-day notice of their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed about this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos reiterated that it had contacted the authority.
At a close, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the verge of possible purchase offers and the judicial queues of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of Maria Luisa Jordá as head of the internal accounting audit.
A decision that will make her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly subject to the chairman of the group.
This is anything but free of polemics because the company is involved in a court battle over suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar’s credit, yesterday the ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) stood before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destiny.
CNMV approves Paternina’s public exclusion tender presented by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina presented by investment company Mer last October 9.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this tender after it had been proven that the conditions comply with the legally binding laws and thus the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted, following the amendments last December, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of €7.65 per share, which in turn represents 8.95% of the share capital, which consists of €6,142,786 in shares registered on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
Furthermore, it has been notified that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and the price of which has been determined by Federico Paternina in accordance with the applicable laws.
New Vehicle Assessment Programmes
These days of storms and accidents not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an appraiser must assess the damage caused and the cost of the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
Calculation of repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of reviewers use this type of system.
The accident assessment and repair service providers collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process it afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader; 80% of all expert opinions are created with their products.
The other two companies competing with GtMotive and Eurotax in the tool market for reviewing and drafting a report.
Working with the data that the manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex sales manager, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
Furthermore, the volume of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and engines have been introduced on the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a tedious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catatolized and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds swiftly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the vehicle fleet on the roads, it is over 99%.
In order to carry out documentation work and to produce databases, Audatex has eight centers (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) distributed worldwide and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a leader about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
By reviewing the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of the AudaPlus products, a standard solution for assessing accidents for reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Outside the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid for depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each expert opinion.
It will be most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros a month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that makes thousands of opinions negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt on the basis of the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the specialist market on the Internet, which can be used to offer vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Their statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
It can be used, for example, to examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of computer tools.
Among other things, it distributes Gt estimates, which are also intended for reviewers and deliver digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT guide for expert opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 appraisers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the Solera Group’s world (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's reference index.
Auction of Accident Cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value, with the possibility of access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, junkyards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
Founded in Germany in 1996, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website now has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 appraisers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been cancelled is no longer allowed to drive on the roads, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, the cars of historical value can be registered again, even if they have been logged out after difficult government visits.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need to use a computer with an Internet connection.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts, and then he can print out the quote and pass it on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for assessment like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
Audatex is currently working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because you can choose a door with it, for example, and then turn the image completely to look at the inside.
