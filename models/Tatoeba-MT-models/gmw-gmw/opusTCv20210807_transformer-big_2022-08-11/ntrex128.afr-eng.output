Members of Welsh Assembly worried they're going to look 'like fools'
There is consternation among some meeting members about the proposal to change their title from AM’e to MWP’e (for Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was caused by plans to change the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament.
Members from across the political spectrum are afraid that it could provoke a mockery.
One member of the Labour Party says his group is concerned because “it rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means stool.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party says his group is "receptive" about the name change, but noted that it is a short leap from MWP to Muppet, the British equivalent of foolish or foolish.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter you.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: “The final decision on any descriptions of what are called Assembly members will, of course, be a matter for the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultation on the proposals that received broad support for calling the meeting a Welsh Parliament.
As for the AM’s title, the Commission elected Welsh Parliament Members of WMPs, but the MWP option received the most approval in a consultation with the public.
AM’s seemingly are proposing alternatives, but the struggle to get consensus can be a headache for the chairman, Elin Jones, who needs to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The legislation on the reforms will also include other changes to the way the meeting works, including rules on disqualification of AMs and the design of the committee system.
AM’s will get the last say in the question of what they should be called when debating the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on change of country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country’s name to the “Republic of Northern Macedonia.”
The popular vote was arranged in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has been insisting for some time that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a claim on its territory and has repeatedly made caption against its applications for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the popular vote on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent because churches in Harlem are struggling
"Historyally speaking, the old people I talked to said there was a bar and a church on every corner," says Mr. Adams.
“None of them is there anymore.”
He says that the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“People socialize these days in other ways,” he says.
“Crows are no longer neighborhoods’ family rooms where people regularly go.”
As far as churches are concerned, the money from asset sales isn’t going to last as long as leaders expect, “and sooner or later they’re back exactly where they started.”
Churches, he adds, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums full of the type of people who won’t help the neighborhood’s remaining refuges.
“The vast majority of people who buy units in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and will therefore bring the day that completely closes these churches even closer, because most of the people who move into these condominiums are unlikely to become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became a black metropolis - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved away in the 1930s.
A black church that worshipped nearby took over the title of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Honor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers in 125th Street, a main street for shopping in Harlem, who did not want to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but while Father Johnson’s members made plans to rebuild it, they ordered the carillon.
Honor David Johnson, Father Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called the carillon “the poor people’s bells.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical tool.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What’s been happening at St. Martin’s in recent months is a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the leeches of the church, others by the Episcopal diocese.
The church council, the congregation's governing body, which consists of leeches, wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese "will try to pass on the costs" to the church council, even though the church council was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors who sent the diocese.
Some municipalities complain about a lack of transparency on the diocese’s part.
Shark injured 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he dived for lobster on the first day of the California crab season, officials say.
The attack took place shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowing closer with a group to help him pull out of the water.
Hammel says he first thought it was just the excitement of a first crayfish, but then he realized "that he cries, 'I was bitten!
I've been biting!'
His whole collarbone was torn open,” Hammel saw as he walked out of the boy.
“I cried that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’” he adds.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is described as critical.
It is not known which shark species are responsible for the attack.
Lifeguard. Larry Giles said at a media education session that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of his upper body.
Officials closed beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to expand to UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s says Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams are struggling with department store-type beauty courses staffed by specialist assistants.
As part of a major expansion in the UK’s  – 2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and homeware decline, the larger beauty corridors will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if it is a success it will be taken to more stores next year.
The investment in beauty takes place while supermarkets look for ways to fill shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and homeware.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the size of its available beauty products to 3,000 products, which will include brand names such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with brand-specific areas similar to those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also launching its Boutique range again so that the majority of products are vegetarian-friendly – something that more and more younger buyers are insisting on.
In addition, the perfume retailer, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon in South London and a second that will open later this year in Selly Oak in Birmingham.
Internet shopping and a move to smaller amounts of food purchased daily at local convenience stores means supermarkets need to do more to persuade people to visit them.
Mike Coupé, Sainsbury’s CEO, said the stores are going to look more like department stores when the supermarket chain tries to fight back with more services and non-food products at the discount stores Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which, according to them, strengthened grocery sales and made the purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after an argument about how to divide the profits from the pharmacies within its stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-store pharmacy business for $125m three years ago to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
It says Lloyds will play a role in the plan by offering an extensive range of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s trading director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty passageways to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially-trained colleagues who will be at hand to provide advice.
Our range of brands are designed to meet every need and the alluring environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a defining beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'Angered' After Holly Willoughby Withdraws From $11 Million Deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has run away “furious” after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled her out of a $11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on her contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their home clothes and accessories brand name, Truly.
The couple’s business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand name.
This Morning host, 37, announced on Instagram that she was withdrawing.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing at the last minute from their lucrative lifestyle brand business – to focus on her own giant contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “furious” when TV’s golden girl announced Tuesday at a tense meeting at the headquarters of his Marlow, Buckinghamshire business, that her new opportunities – which are worth up to 1.5 million pounds – meant she could no longer spend enough time on their home clothes and accessories brand name, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop trade name and was said to have doubled, according to Initiates Willoughby’s estimated $11 million fortune.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones climbed a jet and swapped Britain for one of his vacation homes.
A source says: “Truly was Holly’s top priority by far.
It would be her long-term future that would carry her through the next few decades.
Her decision to pull her out absolutely stunned all those involved.
No one could believe on Tuesday what was happening, it was so close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters that’s ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the This Morning host, one of Britain’s stars that makes the most money flow in, could drive the firm out of pocket millions due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and the possibility that its launch could face even more delays.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby joined Truly in 2016 with Capp and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We will not comment on his business.”
“Hard words, and then we fall in love.”
He mocked criticism he was about to get from the news media for making a remark that some would consider “unprecise” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his kamma “news reader voice.”
“I didn’t give up.”
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step towards the nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament have burned down.
North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, said Saturday, more than three months after the June leaders’ meeting in Singapore, to leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the U.S. to North Korea’s early disarmament activities.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining the pressure.
Trump has taken a much more optimistic stance in his assembly speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were on our way to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this wonderful relationship.”
He says his efforts to improve relationships with Kim yielded positive results – it ended rocket tests, helped free hostages, and caused the remains of American soldiers to be brought home.
And he defended his unusual approach to descriptions of relationships with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have had almost 200 people just standing there,” Trump said as he pointed to the crowd right in front of him.
Hurricane and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been uprooted, no national disaster has been announced, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, which makes it a bit difficult," said me. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it’s not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Given the earthquake that Indonesia constantly endures, the country remains sadly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not a common sight on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of life, even though it was a warning of power.
At its best, it is challenging to travel between Indonesia’s many islands.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s splendid infrastructure a core of his election campaign, spending wasteful money on roads and railways.
But Mr. Yoko’s administration is being mocked by funding shortages as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of slowing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced, such as Christian and Muslim gangs with hooded knives, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons fought on the streets.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge kicks good equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute.
Xherdan Shaqiri reported for Sturridge when he was about 30 years out of Chelsea goal and his team 1-0 behind.
He tipped the ball to the left before kicking far to the goal post.
The effort sailed high over the frame as it hovered to the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball tumbled over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was just trying to get into that position, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as far as possible, so I just tried to create as much time for myself as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and tapping once and not thinking too much about it and just kicking."
Chelsea scored 1-0 after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues' goalkeeper played back to Mateo Kovacic in that play area with a back-up before he scored near the midfield and nailed into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly received and reported in the middle field.
With a beautiful forward kick, he then led Hazard into the window.
Hazard passed the defense and finished with a left foot kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker in the farthest goal net.
Liverpool will compete against Napoli at 3 p.m. in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will be in front of Videoton at 3 p.m. in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesian tsunami
The death toll in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has climbed to 832, the country’s disaster agency said early on Sunday.
It has been reported that many people have been trapped under the clutter of buildings that collapsed the earthquake, which hit a magnitude of 7.5 on Friday, and caused burns of up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with its more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest Man, 32, Suspected of Murder After Woman Killed
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. in Grayson Mews in John Street with knives, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged people in the area who heard or saw anything to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in an early stage but I appeal to anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught anything on dashcam footage, to contact us as they may have information that may be indispensable to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations continue as police say they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment but was told by the police that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take hours before they are re-entered.
It has been heard that a police officer tells one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears on the scene.
She repeatedly said, “It’s so bad.”
At 2 p.m. there were two police cars inside the cordon with another wagon just outside.
A number of officers were left inside the cordon to monitor the block of apartments.
Anyone with information will be asked to call DM, 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 with log 247 of 30 September as a reference.
Parliament’s Cromwell statute becomes latest memorial hit with ‘rewrite of history’ dispute
His exile will be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “sadness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: “It was inevitably in the current debate about the removal of statutes that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The image storming of the English civil wars was still commanded by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's manicured depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still memorable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate depiction is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is established is that the conflict of the mid-17th century gave form to the later development of our nation, and that Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that separation.
His success as a Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance.”
Murder Pig Ripped Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his offspring, "Yuan", was found dead with a torn-off artery covered with blood near a cage at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepared to inject pigs with vaccines at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found a door open to a neighboring pig cage.
He said there was a big male pig in the cage with blood on his mouth.
A forensic investigation reportedly confirmed that the 550-pound pig had bitten the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and torn,” said the cousin, who was called on his side of, “Who,” quoted the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed how Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening New that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are alleged to negotiate compensation for his death.
Although strange, cases of pigs that attack people have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and left the man with critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig pinned a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife deterred the animal.
After a Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBS News that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as “faster.”
“They’re just playful.
They're pikkies, very curious... they're not out to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect,” he said.
Res of Hurricane Rosa will bring widespread heavy rain to southwestern U.S.
As foretold, hurricane Rosa weakens as it travels across the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood rain across northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, from 5 a.m. on Sunday, and was placed 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape and move eastward to the west coast of the US. As Rosa Monday approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will start driving heavy tropical humidity northwest into the southwestern US.
Rosa will bring rains of up to 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in response to the approaching trough, tropical humidity will bring widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous rapid flooding, waste flow, and possibly landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause place-to-place rainfall rates of up to 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially across the largest parts of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapidly worsening conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to risk it on foot into the desert with the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can cause deep gorges to hit ferocious rivers, and thunderstorms will bring heavy local winds and dust clouds.
The approaching trough will bring a little local heavy rain to parts of the coastline of Southern California.
Rainfall totals of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause low waste flow and smooth driving paths.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season.
Some scattered tropical rain showers will begin in Arizona late Sunday and early Monday before the rains become more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
October may see intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the North Pole cools down, but the tropics remain very hot.
This sometimes leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. is on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, lingering summer heat will try to rise and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to start warm in October, with widespread 80’s from the Southern Plain to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a higher likelihood of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. for the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks after the poignant testimony of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christians Blasey Ford, the woman who charged him with a sexual assault allegedly occurring in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political dead end has continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programs for Friday’s on-the-nibble turn: an agreement made by Arizona senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judicial Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had stabbed her in drunkenness and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a heartfelt testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, Nielsen reported.
The company has average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers were not immediately available for other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen sometimes finds it difficult to measure people who look in offices.
Putting it in perspective, it’s an audience as big as one for a deciding football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was ahead of all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long trial, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest was still high after the trial.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he was going to vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS on Friday morning where objectors screamed at him when he tried to take a lift to a Judicial Committee.
He stood with his eyes slapped for a few minutes while CNN vividly portrayed how he was being badly told.
"I'm right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He was told, “You have power while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and went in front of the elevator door, saying that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
The cable and broadcast networks all covered live hours later when the Judicial Committee would vote to promote Kavanaugh’s nomination as the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI would look at the charges against the candidate for next week, as the Democratic minority requested.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democrat Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK EM May accuses critics of ‘political game’ over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political play” with Britain’s future and the undermining of national importance in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
Britain’s Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, Britain, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside her on the cover of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other’s rates was “completely ridiculous.”
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in LSU player's death
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and arrested on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the harassment.
Police found the glasses on the scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on it, CBS affiliated WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted that he had shot Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Judicial Examination Office of East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday saying that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head at the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police’s fleeting task force, the state police’s crime laboratory, Southern University police and territorial citizens for their help with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletics Director Joe Alleva resigns from the area law enforcement for his “zeal and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played for LSU basketball.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 jumps per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "flattened" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“That’s what you’re worried about,” Wayde said.
Volcano spit like in Mexico City
As spitting from the Popocatepeti volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after picking up activity in the crater and registering 183 releases of gas and ash in about 24 hours.
The center monitored multiple drones and shakes.
Images on social media showed how thin low-gas car windscreens cover in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano, which sits 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since an earthquake hit 7.1 central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists to commemorate independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and thousands joined counter-demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarizing vote for dismantling.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police stole them with eggs and poured powder paint that caused dark dust clouds in streets that usually swarm with tourists.
A quarrel also broke out later in the day and the police had to use their bats to keep the fighting in check.
Over several hours, pro-independence groups sang in one tone “No Forget, No Forgiveness” in confrontation with the unionists’ cry of “Long Life Spain.”
Fourteen people received treatment for minor injuries suffered during the marches, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 referendum was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters voted overwhelmingly to become independent but the participation was low, with those against extortion largely boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried in violent clashes to prevent the polling at polling stations across the region from continuing.
Pro-independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he is no longer hopeful for the prospect of Catalonia gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could vote but now we're stuck," he said.
Despite a vital yet nail-wrap victory in regional elections last December, Catalonian pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most famous leaders either in self-imposed exile or in custody for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“It gets more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would stand in European Parliament elections next year.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to disapprove of the decline in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after driving home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a Londonderry home.
The incident unfolded on Thursday at about 19:30 BST in Ballynagardsingel.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
A crossbow may also have been shot at the car at some point.
Menga Goal Gives Livingston 1-0 Victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ensures victory
Promoted Livigston stunned Rangers to transfer Steven Gerrard to just his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's goal proved the difference when Gary Holt's team moved with Hibernian to second place.
Gerrard’s team remained without a win in the Premiership this season and will be standing in front of precursors Heart next week, who are eight points ahead.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is expanding their unsuccessful run in the division to six games, with Chief Coach Holt still not having suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses chances of bot visitors
Holt's team must have led long before they scored a goal, with their bustiness bringing Rangers all sorts of problems on their necks.
SR broke through, but behaved in front of the gatehouse, then AL could only play wide after he got closer and met CH’s headrest across the gatehouse.
The hosts were pleased to have Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could get the visitors with death-game moments.
And so came the decisive goal.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created an opportunity, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson giving Menga the chance to kick and score a goal from the center of the frame.
By that time, Rangers had dominated possession but could not penetrate the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unconcerned.
That pattern was continued in the second half even though Alfredo Morelos forced a turnaround from Kelly.
Scott Pittman has been denied by the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow has tapped wide to evade open play from Livingston.
Crossovers repeatedly reached Livingston’s frame and repeatedly reversed, while two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge of substitute Glenn Middleton and one for handball – were dismissed.
‘Fenomenal’ by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Fantastic game and results for Livingston.
Up to the last man was excellent; they still exceeded expectations on this uphill course.
Their playing style and team have been almost unchanged since their return to first-class, but Holt has received a lot of honor for the way he has strengthened the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Hackett was gigantic with his fancy defense arrangement while Menga was consistently holding on to Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not uphold those standards.
Their final ball was missing and only once they were able to penetrate the home team, which is somewhat of a wake-up call for Rangers, who are in the middle division.
Erdogan gets mixed reception in Cologne
There was smiles and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) when leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which had to restore relations between NATO allies.
They had a fallout on issues that included human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also thickened their voices and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting demonstrations reflect the division of a visitor who is greeted by some German Turks as a hero and is proclaimed by others as autocrats.
Deptford Road Accident: Cyclist Dies in Motorcycle Clash
A cyclist died in a collision in London involving a car.
The collision took place around 10:15 BST near the connection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics were present but the man died on the scene.
The collision came months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-trap on Childers Street, about a mile from where Saturday’s accident occurred.
The Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and notify his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a high-security male prison, the prison office said.
The riot broke out around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still going on at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire.
Specialist “Tornado Keepers” were called in to handle the riot, which included eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were treated on the scene for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to pay attention to a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and will be able to stay behind bars for longer.”
HMP Long Martin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the prison chief received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot officials were called in to pay attention to serious disorder in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa Threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City With Kits Floods (Drought Area Trek Dalk Benefit)
It’s unusual for a tropical low pressure to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week if Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy moves across the southwestern desert and brings rapid flooding risks.
The National Weather Service has already issued fast flood guards for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will approach with rain late by Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones since 1950 have retained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center’s models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon edge of Arizona.
Other parts of the U.S. Southwest, including the Central Rockies and the Great Bowl, are likely to get 1 to 2 inches, with isolated totals of possibly up to 4 inches.
For those outside of flood risk, Rosa’s rain is likely to be a blessing as the region is plagued by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall will likely be beneficial as the southwest currently experiences drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category,” weather.com reported.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s path leads to land approaching across the Baja California peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still at hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moves north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm encounters cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, and so her power diminishes.
So it is expected that she will reach the country on Monday afternoon or evening at tropical storm strength in Mexico.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a significant flooding risk.
"Rainfall totals of 3 to 6 inches are expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 inches possible," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north over Mexico as a tropical storm before it reaches the Arizona border as a tropical depression Tuesday morning and will then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The biggest danger expected of Rosa is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the U.S. southwest,” the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Midsummer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage sons of a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenage son was found on Saturday at about 04:00 BST in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital where he was still in a “stable” condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who might have any cellphone footage of what happened to emerge.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'suffered under the meanness, the anger' of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the relentless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “suffered under the meanness, the anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and fiercely and emotionally denied a claim by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing about her claim.
The president said on Saturday that Americans saw “the brilliant and quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most competent legal spirits of our time, a jurist with a pure record of public service,” he told the crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
“I’m not standing, but I’m standing,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for these candidates everywhere."
Trump has argued that the Democrats are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first major procedural vote on the Senate floor over Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths due to Indonesian shaking, tsunami, with numbers still rising
At least 384 people died and many were washed away when giant waves broke on beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday for a feast on the beach when burners up to six meters (18 feet) high broke at sunset on the beach, washed away many after their death and destroyed everything that was in the way.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-sized earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy with their activities on the beach and did not immediately run and they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency BNPB, said during an information session in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come on its own, it dragged cars, logs, houses together, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami moved across the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous buildings and shops that have been destroyed, bridges that have been distorted and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday night, the shoreline shook.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s giant shake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which sits at the tip of a long, narrow bay, could have worsened the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of buildings that collapsed, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the accidents and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala that is closer to the earthquake hurricane.
Communication “is completely obstructed with no information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a disaster, but it can get much worse,” they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not telling that a tsunami struck Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard screaming desperate warnings about the upcoming tsunami to the people at the bottom of the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the beach and drags buildings and cars along.
Reuters could not immediately explain the footage.
The shaking and tsunami caused major power cuts that cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending freight planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is only reopened for assistance efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises above 800.
This is very bad.
Although World Vision’s staff of Donggala arrived safely in Palu City, where employees were hiding in stockpile shelters erected in their office courtyard, they drove past scenes of devastation on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
They told me they saw a lot of homes that were destroyed,” he said.
This is very bad.
Even as aid groups begin the horrible task of setting the disaster relief task in motion, some people have complained that experienced foreign aid workers are prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian guidelines, funds, supplies and staff from overseas can only come into operation after the area of the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
This has never happened.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open it to international assistance, but it still has no status.”
With the arrival of the second night on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of those still missing are hopeful that their loved ones will be the miracles that will bring relief to the sad storyline of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a sewer pipe.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been stuck under rubble for two days with her mother’s corpse beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national parachute weaver team, coached two of the missing parachute weavers for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Another of those trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior in the parachute sweep field, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon tells how, in the hours after news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse circulated on social media among the parachute weave community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
However, his messages were only answered with one grey check mark, instead of two blue check marks.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 during refill of ATM at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who refilled an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Station.
The car’s driver was emptying an ATM in an entertainment complex and getting ready to deliver more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man “came running from behind the Brink’s employee” and stole the bag of money that had to be delivered.
According to the release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing from the scene, but the police did not specify the number involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper Changes His Name to Ye
Kanye West will change his name to Ye
With the announcement of the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: “The being formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live where he is expected to introduce his new all Yandhi.
He replaced Ariana Grande on the program that canceled for “emotional reasons,” the program’s producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has religious meaning to him.
"I believe 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – just the reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs was already known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West employee, JAY-Z, has also come up with or without a hyphen and capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has pledged to never use military power against civilians in the run-up to the country’s 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to control the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful demonstration in the plaza where up to 300 people died at a time when leftist student movements throughout Latin America posed.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and a lack of training opportunities are pulling youth to gangs.
U.S. needs to double AI funding
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in that field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple, said.
The remarks come after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even if briefly the U.S. has an overall formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: to be the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the AI research budget will be a good start given that all the other countries are so far behind the US and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next big AI performance will be achieved in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the HUB of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-rated American Othello player and later became a management officer at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee has acknowledged previous technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s robotics challenge, and asked when the next one will be, to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes away the academic leaders; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired influential people from other universities to work on AI.
Lee says immigration policy changes can also help to boost U.S. AI efforts.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s State Council issued its Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint centre for artificial intelligence that aims to involve partners from the industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of an Artificial Intelligence Board.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as the NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has come under fire for months.
Macedonians vote to change country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia”, actions that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its membership boats for the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that their northern neighbor’s name represents a claim in the area and has refused their admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June, based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argued that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts as to whether the rise would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum ballot read: “Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued that it is a price that can be paid to chase admission to Macedonia, one of the countries that came about from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough parliamentarians have said they will accept the outcome of the vote to decide it.
The name change will require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of inconvenience at 1 NM.
But the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonia’s EM, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their votes for the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country’s name that will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small raise and approached chairs in front of tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of the Euro-Asia integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe the vast majority will be in favour of it, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a “yes” result would be “confirmation of our future.”
A survey published by Macedonia’s Institute for Policy Research last Monday said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – less than the required amount.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A relapse in the referendum will be the first serious relapse for the policy of a pro-Western government since the government took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero navigates through entire Brighton defense for goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cleared the Brighton defense in Manchester City’s 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy during his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper received a hint at the middle field at the beginning of the series.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before hitting the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed past one defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton goalkeeper.
He then pushed a hint to the left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the cage to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a kick into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems with his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told journalists.
“We were talking about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
This is what happened.
We’re glad he had a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League wrestling.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguero received the ball deep in the Brighton area.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane had a few touches before he led Sterling to the farthest goal angle.
The Sky Blues' forward kicked the ball into the net just before he was over the back line.
City hoist Hoffenheim in Champions League Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Joker wants to play spoilers against Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there isn’t much reason to force another start.
But the ever-competing Scherzer wants to take on the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are still playout implications for the Rockies, which have a one-match lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies scored at least a promotional spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but still want to tie their first division title.
"Although we play for nothing, we can at least play the game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level of any point of mine this year.
Why don’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals have yet to announce their starting player for Sunday, but are reportedly favorable to have Scherzer thrown into such a situation.
Scherzer, who will have his 34th start, had a throwing workout on Thursday and will play on his normal rest-Sunday.
The Washington right-handed is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 turnouts in 220 2/3 turns this season.
Trump to meet in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of Republican rise in midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our life.
It’s one of the big, big – I’m not standing, but I’m actually standing and that’s why I’m fighting for these candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “One sees this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, one sees this happening now.
And they are now determined to take the power back by using any possible way, one sees the meanness, the witchcraft.
They don’t care who hurts them, who they have to walk over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and power, we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“And one sees it over the past four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil and mean and vain and false.”
He referred to the name of Senate’s judicial committee’s high-ranking Dianne Feinstein, who received harsh orders from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I'm waiting for one -- it was really weak body language -- the weakest body language I've ever seen."
Workers’ Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerable to those who say what they think
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to put me under censorship, it wasn’t exactly a surprise.
After all, I’m the last person in a string of Labour Party MPs to be told we’re not welcome – all because we’ve said what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatments because she stood up in a fearless way against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censorship criticized me for differing from Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically enough similar issues over which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday said that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of my eight years as the local Labour Party LP, that was exactly what Friday nights’ AR meetings were.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of “more friendly, more benevolent” politics has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated within the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom I thought I had previously shared similar political views began to expect me to take a U-turn and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with – whether on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there is a tirade of scorn on social media asking that I don’t be re-elected, disapproval of politics from the core and telling me not to be in the Labour Party.
And not just my experience.
In fact, I am happier than my colleagues because the remarks directed at me tend to be political.
I have a lot of respect for the professionalism and determination for those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults every day, but never shy away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the levels of insult have normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every “motion of distrust” or change of selection rules, the party becomes scarier.
I’ve had a lot of advice for the past two years that encourages me to stay under the radar, not be so outspoken, and that I will then be “good.”
But I didn’t go into politics to do that.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolteacher, spurred by the Thatcher government’s neglect that literally left my state high school behind, I have been fighting for better public services for those who need it most – either as a local councillor or government minister.
I never hid my politics, even at the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been confused about my policies and areas where I differ from the current leadership.
To those who supported the motion on Friday, I can only say that with the country embarking on a Brexit that is going to harm all households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the one message I actually have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my voters, whether or not they are members of the Labour Party: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of not being re-elected or political benefit will prevent me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the LP for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unconquered Ayr above
Two late threes may have skewed the final result slightly, but there’s no doubt Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent’s Premiership game of the day.
They are now at the top of the score, the only unconquered team of the ten.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as their better chances, that carried the home team and coach Peter Murchie has all the right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our matches so far and we’re still unconquered, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Honor to Ayr, they took their chances better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's three in the 14th minute, intended by Frazier Climo, made Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes, made available for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to count the numbers and Jason Baggot scored an unintended three.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with a penalty kick, just before he, just before rest, intended to make it 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson’s three, targeted by Baggot, reduced the backlog to five points.
There was a long delay for a serious injury at Ruaridh Knott that was carried on a portable, and from the reboot, Ayr increased the lead with a Stafford McDowall three, targeted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair Macpherson then got a yellow card and once again Melrose took advantage of the extra player with an unintended three by Bruce Colvine, at the end of much-pressed play.
The home team made a return and then Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he took Climo to death without the ball, and from the penalty stand MacPherson pressed the ball to death behind the upcoming Ayr loosening.
Climo intended to do so, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe got David Armstrong's goal and sent flank Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth three.
Still Game star looks like he's starting a new career in restaurant industry
It seems Still Game star is moving to the hospitality industry after it is discovered that he has been appointed as the director of a company of licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and plays in with old comedian Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the program, and it seems Kiernan is getting ready for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment, although a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan would get involved in Glasgow’s “prosperous restaurant industry.”
'The sea is ours': Countryside Bolivia hopes court will reopen away to Pacific
Sailors patrol a mascara-covered naval quarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly a sea-blue flag.
Naval bases from Titicaca Lake to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "The sea is to our right.
It’s a duty to get it back.”
Throughout the country-run Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that they lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh – as is the need to re-enter the Pacific Ocean.
That hope is probably the highest it has been in decades, while Bolivia waits for a ruling by the international court on 1 October, after 5 years of talks.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and naturally expects the outcome with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the IGH ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will find in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of sporadic negotiations – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia a sovereign passage to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – also has a lot to do with Monday’s ruling.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in Bolivia’s favor – and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to allocate Chilean territory, stipulating that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the IRH’s ruling comes just six months after the final allegations shows that the case was “not complicated,” says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of helping Bolivia’s case, the past four years may have delayed it.
“The issue of access to the sea was hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
Morales’ aggressive rhetoric struck any remaining Chilean benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume discussions at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold close discussions.
The two countries exchanged last ambassadors in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of differences with reciprocal benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political stool.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see what we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not come unless their U.S. can trust
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his country would never first disarm their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the competing countries’ leaders.
His comments follow after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo apparently is on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which has reached a dead end, more than three months after Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “dream image” that will bring ongoing sanctions and U.S. caps to a statement that ended the Korean War also bringing the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the statement without Pyongyang first taking meaningful steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about relinquishing an arsenal that the country considers the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim Trump summit.
Parisian Fashion Shows Reveal Latest Series of Big Headwear on the Road to Shops Near You
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely turn off the sun, you don’t have to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of awkward oversized head coverings at their SS19 collection on the board that captivated the style at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats traversed Instagram this summer and these designers paraded their staggering creations on the board.
The highlight by Valentino was an oversized beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that swallowed the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included watermelon decorated with gems, a wizard hat, and even an pineapple – but it’s not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks had woven lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba gear, including a snorkel and dive glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream horn.
And if you continue the great fashion setting, this is your happy day.
Style watchers predict that the huge hats may be on their way to the shops near you.
The oversized hat follows shortly on the heels of 'La Bomba', the straw hat with a two-foot wide edge seen on everyone's heads, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat spread over social has sent another great creation across the board – a straw beach bag that was almost the size of the swimsuit-clothed model that wore it.
The roasted orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fraiings and finished a white leather handle at the top, stood out at Jacquemus’ La Riviera’s SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags appear in stores for next summer – since the designer made such a big impact that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Essential for Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have a zipper of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which were only reinforced by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other community enterprises.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their position as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a custom school curriculum, we see world languages continue as a popular and desirable subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher grade A.
The data, collected from SCIS’s 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 of those who studied French, and 63 of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young adults will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages now have the same prestige as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools’ curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission on Professions and Skills found in 2014 that of the reasons employees provide why they struggle to fill jobs, 17 percent are attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more likely jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, in the future they will have a real advantage with such a lifelong skill.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically put a multilingual person above the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a double percentage, 15 percent.
That is why it is so important to invest in today’s language education.
Knowing several languages, especially those from developing economies, will equip children with a better chance of getting meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school will differ in the languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other languages will be taught that are considered essential for the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this stage, in a global business environment, that languages are still immensely important for the country’s future, and therefore must be reflected in education.
Truly, modern languages really need to be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s young people.
It is very fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make Sunday’s debut for San Diego Lakers
The wait is almost over for fans to watch LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s preseason opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play a limited amount of time.
After an exercise earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six games in the preseason program.
“I don’t need preseason games at this stage in my career to get ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia gathering, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching an election event in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five scheduled gatherings in the next week, including stops in friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the affirmative vote currently held back for his choice to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when voting in November.
What time is Trump’s gathering in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia below via live stream.
Trump is likely to pay attention to this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense about allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected confirmation vote held back for up to a week as the FBI launches investigation.
But the main point of view of this excess convergence is to help the Republicans facing tough elections in November.
President Trump’s campaign thus said these five rallies in the following week were aimed at “visiting volunteers and supporters while Republicans are trying to protect and enlarge the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control over Congress is so critical of its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we reach the busy campaign season,” a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who refused to mention its name, told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, arranged for the Wesbanco arena in Wheeling, can draw fans from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and can be covered by the media in Pittsburgh,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind according to the voting patterns.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost at the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Courage to Fight to Keep Hope Alive When Entering Sunday’s Single
After three one-sided sessions, the four-game teams of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Rider Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is an all-in-one sporting concept but one in which players believe wholeheartedly, and certainly in competitions like this.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
“They ran by six points and now it’s four, so we’re wearing it as a bit of momentum, I reckon,” Jordan Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage, four points in front and twelve more to be played.
However, the Americans feel, as Spieth says, that they have such a bit of wind in their sails and that there is a lot to encourage them, not least the class of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four.
Spieth was deadly from the mob to the clean field and led by his example.
That shard of celebration cries got louder as his round progressed and he sank a critical set to win game four completely in a draw while he and Thomas were behind after two laps with two.
Her set-up that won the game at 15 for them was greeted with a similar shout, the kind that tells one that he believes the American team has another chance.
“You really just have to take everything out and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s what those players are doing now.
18 pussies to print their stamp.
The only players who have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Rider Cup.
Europe’s impoverished but charming couple got four out of four and can’t do anything wrong.
“Moliwood” was the only couple who didn’t record one over track rate on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided one over track rate on Saturday morning as well as during the back nine Friday morning.
That run, and the way their energy appears to flow to and from this exuberant crowd, confirms that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who can sound a potential European victory when the sun falls over Le Golf National.
Prefer both at once or at different puddles.
It is too early to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short laps with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he played with Alex Noren.
One hold over track rate and two doubles on the front nine caused the Spaniard and the Swede to end up in a hole from which they could hardly even get.
On Sunday, there is no one to help you out of your hole.
The four-ball and four-game teams are so exciting to keep a close eye on because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has always played better as a team so far and significantly took the lead on the last day, but this four-game session also showed that the U.S. team has the courage for the struggle that some, especially at home, have been in doubt.
Europe runs 10-6 ahead during the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a healthy advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming with a 10-6 lead from Saturday’s four-ball and four-game games.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that performed unequally in the morning's four balls, so they won the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the four games and won two games, but did not let the backlog shrink.
Jim Furyk’s team needed eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, who are called "Moliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Rider Cup to score four points after their first four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls, they played great together to defeat a pop Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambreau with an even more convincing 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, sometimes showed flashes of brilliantness but he had now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning’s four-balls, returned to play with Henrik Stenson in the four-games to a 2&1 defeat for Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – who ranked first and third on the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not always get their sense on a pleasant day with a little wind southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth won three major tournaments and Justin Thomas set the mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 win over Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 3&4 in the four-games after losing the first two puddles.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a backlog of four points when they entered the single, though Furyk’s team just need to play evenly to keep the trophy because they already hold it.
However, after being second best for two days, it does not seem that they will succeed in a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will ‘decided not’ unilaterally disarm without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions exacerbate their distrust of the United States and that the country will certainly not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally without such traits.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Body’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea has taken “significant benevolence measures” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site, and promising not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not see any corresponding response from the U.S.,” he said.
“Without any confidence in the U.S., there would be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we would certainly not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to nuclear weapons removal, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his words seemed meaningful in that it did not unconditionally reject the unilateral removal of nuclear weapons as Pjongjang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-Oen and Donald Trump at the very first summit between a U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore when Kim pledged to work for the “destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea wants a formal end to the Korean War of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also resisted requests to slow down strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on “destruction of nuclear weapons first” and exerts more pressure by tightening the level of sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling way, and even objecting to the “declaration of the end of the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can force us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are aggravating our distrust.”
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader raised at the United Nations earlier this week.
Rather, the minister drew attention to three meetings over the past five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: “If the party were in this issue about the destruction of nuclear weapons South Korea and not the US, the destruction of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end.”
The tone of Ri’s speech, however, was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea’s missiles would be directed at the U.S. landmass after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “fire arrowman” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “destroy” North Korea, praised Kim abundantly for his courage for taking steps to disarm, but he said that much work still needs to be done and that sanctions still have to remain there until North Korea destroys nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a time frame for it, saying “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps they have taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “application of sanctions by the Security Council should go on diligently and unceasingly until we realize the full, final, confirmed destruction of nuclear weapons.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an effort to dry up funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pjongjang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip there did not go well.
He left Pjongjang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of making “bandy claims” just hours later.
In a meeting with Moon, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and also to take a nuclear complex if the United States “according measures”.
He said Kim told him that the “corresponding measures” he wants to see are security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore as well as steps toward normalizing relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year lets all of its undergraduate students get more sleep in an effort to counteract the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-driven “all-night sessions.”
An academic has found that students at the world’s top university are often uninformed when it comes to the basics of how to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical Faculty and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he is believed to be the first of his kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, one girl approached me and said, 'Why are they telling me this first, in my senior year?'
She said no one had told her yet how important sleep is – which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was presented for the first time that year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical Faculty and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students were severely deprived of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a few interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students need to click on coffee cups, curtains, workout shoes and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation and the importance of a sleep rhythm.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase risks of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know this will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health impact of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of pride of “studying all night” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
To make sure you get enough good quality sleep, a student’s “secret weapon” should be to avoid stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid it from putting on weight, because sleep deprivation puts the brain in a starvation mode, which makes you feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after running one of his classes last year, during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to work for a campus-wide course.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the institution where people compete with each other.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when to wake up, and being aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm and cause you to struggle to touch the sheep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Purpose of Menga conquers Gerrard's men
Rangers experienced another sarcasm when Dolly Menga's goalkeeper Steven Gerrard's incoherent team scored a 1-0.
The Ibrox team wanted to score their first win as visitors since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only put Gerrard in his second defeat in 18 matches as a driver so that his team was eight points behind Hearts, which ran loose in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga struck seven minutes before rest, and it didn’t look like a Rangers team would play the same without much inspiration.
As Rangers now fall to sixth position, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be further trouble for Rangers after border judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown off the road.
Gerrand made eight changes to the team that rushed past Ayr to the final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same Livi-11 that took a point of Hearts last week and he would have been in his nods with the way his well-trained team killed their opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated ball possession, but Livingston did more when they had the ball.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first rendezvous sent Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder opened his big chance.
A deep free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only miss kicking at the back goal.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have gotten a penalty goal at the quarter-point when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to get just two shots to the target during the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly bothered by Lassana Coulibaly’s headshot and a tough goalkeeper from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi’s opener may have been against the direction of play at the 34th minute, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if it’s just for their hard work.
Rangers did not deal with a deep set of Jacobs once again.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained coolhead and sent it to Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the exchange had an almost immediate impact when the wing sent to Morelos but the impressive Kelly chased from his line to the block.
But Livingston continued to force the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up the ball long after long.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to stop Jacobs before Lithgow could get in wide from the corner.
Rangers' deputy Glenn Middleton had another late claim for a penalty kick when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Teller
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: 30 September 1882, today 136 years ago, and WE TELL MORE ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger Counter.
Since then, the Geiger Teller has been a pillar of science, and it has also become a pillar in pop culture, as in the 1950 film “Bells of Coronado,” in which those two unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played:
He said, “What on earth is this?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can even hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Good, it's cracking around now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ robber cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill rower cells
Vaccine learns immune system to identify robber cells as part of treatment
Method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can then ‘see’ a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject it again
A test substance shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman treated with the vaccine, who teaches the immune system to identify robbery cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves withdrawal of immune cells from a patient, changing them into the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to attack cancer cells worked to beat a kind of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump mocking speech after his performance on SNL while wearing a MAGA hat.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was out in the studio during a Saturday Night Live after a protracted performance in which he believed U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would elect him in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great-pet, he went out against the Democrats and repeated his support of Trump.
“I talk to a white man so often and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s judicial committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the footage of West’s mockery was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West by posting it.
West also complained to the audience that it was made difficult for him behind the stage about what he was wearing on his head.
“They put me on top of that.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They bullied me!
And then they say I’m in a low place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went ahead: "Do you want to see the low place?" and said that he would put on his "superman's coat, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
“Try love.”
His comments provoked an out-journal at least twice in the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there saying to the publication: "The whole studio has become deadly silent."
West was brought in as a late substitute for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rhyme chatterer Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was very surprised with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed like a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of conservation group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR PROVISION TO THE PEOPLE.”
But chat show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “who he is and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and proclaims an ideology that puts my community at risk.
He is free.
We too,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rhyme chatter announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now “the creature formerly known as Kanye West.”
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rhyme chatterer, Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion and of course, popular music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, criticized the stereotype of the macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to be respected.
Kit spoke to The Sunday Times Culture and said he believes “something went wrong” and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the .meToo era.
Kit, who recently married his fellow star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels “reasonably strong” about getting work done on this issue.
“I personally feel pretty strong about it at the moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What did our men learn as they grew up regarding the problem we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may well be responsible for the growth in toxic masculinity due to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel like they need to have this certain aspect of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions in our time – how do we change it?
Because obviously something went wrong with our young men.”
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any of the Game of Thrones prologues and sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, because he says he is ‘ready with battlefields and horses’.
From November, Kit will play in a new version of Sam Shephard’s True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was to meet his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this program, so that way it gave me my future family, and my life from here,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the premises of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, representing a change from the past.
HIV has traditionally spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who have contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a critical issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very common.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, China’s government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to make the case work.
Maxine Waters denies a staff member leaked GOP senators’ data, condemning ‘dangerous lies’ and ‘conspiracy theories’
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters on Saturday challenged allegations that a member of her staff had posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislature’s Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the allegations are driven by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and yet heinous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Hill during the Senate Panel’s trial of allegations of sexual misconduct against the nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was related to Waters’ office and disclosed the information of a member of Waters’ staff, the Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of this fraudulent and false allegation – was by no means responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded claim is completely untrue and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement soon provoked online criticism, including former White House press representative Ari Fleischer.
“This denial testifies to anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he hasn’t done, he shouldn’t be angry.
He shouldn’t be challenging.
He should not question the prosecutor’s motives.
He has to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer apparently compared Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during Thursday’s trial.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who tries to lift Waters from the cushions in the midterm election, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office “notified the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be legally accountable for everything they do that is destructive and dangerous to every member of my staff.”
Johnny English Strikes Again review - fawn Rowan Atkinson spy spottery
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meaning in any new film with a British impact and it seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action comedy spotter franchise – which started with Johnny English in 2003 and continued with Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will tongue-in-the-choice self-atisfaction on the subject of how obvious power we are be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the awkward Johnny English with his scouts and rubber face renewed his license to waste everything on for the second time – and his name is a clearer indication than anything else that he is a great comic creation for non-English-speaking movie audiences.
He is, of course, the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretension to sophisticated elegance, has a bit of Clouseau, a piece of Mr Bean, and a good shot at that guy who contributed a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme song at the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international man of riddles, leaving chaos behind him, which Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard ads.
There are one or two odd moments in this latest version of YOU.
I liked Johnny English coming to a helicopter while he was dressed in a medieval armored robe and briefly chopping the screw blades against his helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy is shown, but the humor feels rather faint and peculiarly superfluous, especially when the “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now use comedy as an ingredient themselves.
The humor feels like it’s aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English’s adversity is not as original and focused as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the persona of Bean.
The perpetual thematic assumption is now that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A Cubercracker infiltrated Britain's super-secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a lamentable little role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for a prime minister who is a bloated and besieged character, who is already experiencing an overall collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thomspson is doing her utmost with this quasi-Teresa May character but there is very little in the text to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is at risk, she must call someone out of his retirement.
And it means the struggling Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher at some fancy institution, but who from the record gives lessons on how to be a secret agent, there are some cute jokes here when English offers a School of Rock-type spy school.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency assignment and is reunited with his former long-suffering companion Bough, again interpreted by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, an allamorphic role in which too little is expected of Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the Batman and Robin are completely wasted in Her Majesty’s secret service and come across Olga Kurylenko’s beautiful femme fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister finds himself under the dangerous spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the enigmatic Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their journey of ridiculous escapades: disguised as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire, causing chaos when they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury sailing yacht; and English releases pure anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality headline to get acquainted with the inside of Volta’s home.
For that last scene, nothing is spared, but as cute and exuberant as it may be, the whole affair is quite like children's TV.
It's pretty mediocre.
And like the other Johnny English movies, I couldn’t stop myself from thinking, can’t the British give Rowan Atkinson a role that really brings his talent to justice?
Labour denies it devises a plan for Britons to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party should consider a drastic plan that would cause Britons to work a four-day week – but be paid for five days.
The party claims that company bases want savings caused by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to be transferred to workers by giving them extra day off.
This will make workers enjoy a three-day weekend – but they will still take the same payment home.
Sources say it would “fit” the party’s economic agenda and plans to set up the country in favor of the workers.
Changing to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to harness the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an ambition that fits in with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker as well as with the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to endorse such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day work week during its campaign for the general election in 2017.
This ambition, however, is not endorsed by the entire Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Conference to expand on his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless directors” and “profiteers” at service companies.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get their entire investment back as a Labour government can make “deductions” on the basis of alleged violation.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on boards of companies and create inclusive ownership funds to give 10 percent of equity in private sector enterprises to employees, who can get annual dividends of up to $500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy Tells “60 Minutes” If FBI Investigation of Kavanaugh Could Change Their Opinion
The FBI’s investigation of accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau’s findings could persuade any Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Sens. John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could elaborate anything that could make them change their opinion.
Kennedy seemed more receptive than his colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said at the beginning of the trial, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that accusation came out, and said, ‘Did you do it?
He was determined, determined, unambiguous.”
Graham’s voice, however, seems to be unchangeable.
“I have shaped my opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it will require an accusation of dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know it: Brett diligently denied it,” Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she called couldn't confirm it.
It is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything change.”
What is the World Citizens’ Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the World Citizens’ Festival, an annual music event that has a particularly impressive group of stars acting and having an equally impressive purpose; the end of poverty in the world.
The World Citizens’ Festival is now in its seventh year and during the festival tens of thousands of people will flock to Central Park’s Great Lawn to enjoy not only performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the event’s true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens’ Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the World Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a GDP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as doing volunteer work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way to create awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But just how successful was World Citizen with 12 years left to achieve his goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a great way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters, supporting a multitude of different goals.
It says these actions have helped encourage global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion that will potentially impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements arising from its performances, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised.
The group estimates that the confirmed money so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important commitments include the Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential”, and pledging to give $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after they have received more than 4,700 tweets from World Citizens.
“With support from the government of the UK, donors, national governments and world citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd in April 2018 during a concert in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions to approach the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the common questions on his website asking “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”
World Citizen responded: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will be successful because together we have more power.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Navy May Use 'Blockade' to Stop Russian Energy Exports - Home Secretary
“If necessary,” Washington may leave him on its fleet to stop Russian energy from landing in the market, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has claimed Russia’s involvement in Syria – particularly where it works at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to act as brokers for energy just like in Eastern Europe, southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to an official, there are ways and means to tackle it.
“The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure the seas are open, and if necessary, to block, to make sure their energy doesn’t end up on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the attendees of an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that considers itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the US.
He went on to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and noted that they are practically the same.
“The economic option on Iran and Russia is, more or less, to finance and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “single talent” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The rulings come as Trump’s administration was on a mission to boost exports of their liquid natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, by far the cheaper option for European consumers.
For that reason, Trump administration officials, including America’s President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, makes Moscow “prisoner.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fiery opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with America’s Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. view provoked counter-reaction from Germany, reaffirming their commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “seriously consider” being president in 2020, Massachusetts senator said
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would “seriously consider” standing as president after the midterm elections.
At a village meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider standing.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman on the highest sport,” she said.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider standing for president."
Warren voiced her opinion on President Donald Trump during the town meeting, saying he “takes the country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was very outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before our vote.”
A survey released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters don’t think she should stand in 2020.
Eighty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported the idea that she should stand.
The survey showed more support for the idea that former governor Deval Patrick should stand, with 38 percent supporting the idea that he should potentially stand and 48 against it.
Other high profile Democratic names discussed to potentially stand in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Calls Track Palin's PTSV at Donald Trump's Meeting
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with an incident of domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he has been going through since he returned, I have sympathy with other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the injury with which our soldiers are returning,” she told an audience at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “the elephant in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans, “they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is any respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and air forces and every other member of the army have given to the country.”
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence, assault of a woman, interference with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while under the influence, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police.
18 states, D.C. supports challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court legal order in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker and challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August has not been made public.
She says her partner "and his violent gang member boys," mistreated her, but American officials refused her asylum request on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of U.S. asylum applicants, as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed immigrants without the necessary documents fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Columbia’s attorney general Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international laws.”
“Federal laws require all asylum applications to be decided on the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a lawyer violates that policy,” the court’s friend said.
Attorneys further argued in the legal order that the policies that deny immigrants access harm the U.S. economy and say it is more likely that they will become entrepreneurs and “provide needed labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
“Asyl is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his announcement of the policy on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly new.
“It feels very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforts her feverish infant son at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute brings an ambulance bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, searching for soaked possessions, trying to save anything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-sized shake, were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rest outside Palu’s army hospital where patients are treated outside due to ongoing strong aftershocks.
Tears fill his eyes as he tells of the violent earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the walls’ debris, I think,” Haris told Associated Press, adding that he and his family were in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife crying for help, but then silenced.
I don’t know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with ‘propaganda advertising’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily that praised the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily’s paid filing in the Des Moines Register – the state Iowa newspaper with the most sales – after he accused China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections of November 6, a complaint China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election has marked what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase in an increasing Washington campaign to put pressure on China.
While it’s normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war that has led them to equalize rate rounds on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa who supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “now aggravates bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading their propaganda, the Chinese government seizes on America’s cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing, one will find very limited deviant voices and not see any real reflection of the divergent opinions the Chinese people have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers shunned the offer to publish his article,” although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans alienate women's voters for interim elections with Kavanaugh debacle, warn analysts
While many top Republicans stand at Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defend him in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will see counter-reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions about this run tremendously high, and most Republicans are on record indicating they already want to continue with the vote.
Those things cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School for The Hill, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)’s incitement to an FBI investigation on the nipper would be enough to reassure fierce voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, demonstrators shouted “November is on its way!” while demonstrating in the Senate’s entrance portal while Republicans who chose the Judicial Committee’s control continued Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be very high,” Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it was already high; it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among suburban swing-voters and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who don’t vote often because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing the details of her allegation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said a counter-reaction could follow if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not about the committee’s vote or the final vote and whether or not Kavanaugh is put on the court, it’s also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
But Americans seem somewhat divided about who to believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimonies, with a little more choosing the latter’s side.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 say they definitely or likely believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitively joking during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s incitement, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore before the Senate Judicial Committee to testify that Kavanaugh had assaulted her while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while attending a party during their student years at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the global web plans to launch a new internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the global web, is launching a start-up business that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee spotted that the idea with Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do this,” he said of the project.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data storage” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, do-lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional utilities.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available at the same time and on one browser.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access that type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea for Inrupt, according to HUB John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, developers on the staff contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer encoders.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don’t talk to “Facebook and Google about introducing an overall change whether or not, where all their business models are completely reversed overnight.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to provide commercial energy as well as an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the Worldwide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the Global Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Spiritual Celebration
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt.kol Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and never knew he had earned the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “brilliantly symbolic” that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, lt.kol. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns."
He later rushed to the firing line and led the line forward with the "greatest courage" before he man-only stormed a field gun and knocked out three of the division.
Lt.kol Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions are “something I know I can never do, but something that is humiliating.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath on the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he “felt honored to be able to play a role in the parade” and added that “the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by a bunch of people.”
MMA supporters stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, but get Peppa Pig
Imagine, you stay awake all night to watch the packed Bellator 206, just so you can't watch the main event.
The San Jose program included 13 battles, including six on the main program that would be broadcast directly through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were on their way to say the fight to each other, viewers in the UK were left muted when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after staying awake for the fight until the early hours.
One supporter described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some sick joke."
“It’s government regulations that the content at 6 p.m. wasn’t appropriate and therefore they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
""Peppa the pig," yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they would work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think that when I think about the retransmission, I think we can probably work out something,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to sort it out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But our work on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of text messages being sent back and forth and it wasn’t all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn’t, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that this will not happen next time.
We would limit it to five battles instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried to offer more to our fans and just went about our time.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels 'Inferior' About Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up with an inferiority feeling about his sexuality – but that gave him the motivation to be a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize before he went to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he expressed his feelings about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that having to become a parent made him less caring about winning at the Olympics.
The regular host of the years-long program, Kirsty Young, has been abducted for a few months due to illness.
When he appeared as a discarder on Laverne’s first program, Daley said he felt “less” than everyone else when he grew up because “it wasn’t socially acceptable to like boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, are the real things that gave me the strength and energy to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint anyone when they would eventually find out about his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medalist became a high profile LGBT fighter and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He says he has expressed his feelings because he is so lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – U.S. filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “catched him aside.”
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but says the age difference has never been a matter.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple became parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley says his “whole perspective” has changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I need to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets for London 2012 – because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only after he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally admitted that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I’ve been dreaming about all my life – diving in front of my home crowd at an Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first lyrics – Proud of Heather Small – who also resonated with him in the post-Olympic build-up and still gave him chicken meat.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson not on drift and withdraws from Saturday's Rider Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to manage his form to stop it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time in the biennial event, was withdrawn from the game by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's four-ball games and four-counts.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time Major winner will divide his day between being a racial leader and working on the exercise job on his game in hopes of redressing what matters.
Even at the height of his career, he was never the straightest driver and therefore the 48-year-old is not the ideal person for the narrow Le Golf National course where the long field always punishes the wandering lashes.
And as if the track on its own isn’t challenging enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday in his ninth match, who has teamed up with novice Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, which are four points behind, start the 12 singles games well, Mickelson’s game can be absolutely essential.
Furich expressed his confidence in his husband, not that he could say much differently.
“He fully understood his role he had today, knocked me on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be right tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Heroes Hall and he has contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he was going to play two games.
I’ve put more in perspective, but that’s how things worked out and that’s what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like anyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record on Sunday for the player who played the most Rider Cup matches.
This could mark the end of a Rider Cup career that never really matched the highlights of its individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence contributed intangible aspects to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, caught, loves to shave the crazy, and he’s a wonderful guy to have in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed shaving with him crazy, which was fun to see.
He offers so much more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows great lead can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the last day’s single in the Rider Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable experience.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead, but only won nail scratch with 141-2-131-2.
“One keeps reminding oneself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won nail scratch,” Bjorn said, in the photo, after watching the 2018 class win Le Golf 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 ahead yesterday.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
You will be full tomorrow.
Go out and do all the right things.
It is not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that’s trying to win the trophy, and that’s where the focus stays.
I’m always focusing on the 12 players on our team, but we’re also well aware of who’s on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Rejoice in how his players fared on the difficult golf course, Bjorn adds: “I’ll never get ahead of things with this.
Tomorrow is a horse of a different color.
Tomorrow it is the individual participation that comes in turn, and it is a horse of a different color.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things go well, but when you’re there individually, you’re tested to your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he must also take the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, his peer Jim Furyk wants his players to do better individually than they did as playmates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of that big last day, where he was part of the wishpan at Brookline before he ended as a loser when Europe achieved the "miracle of Medina".
“I remember every covert word of it,” he said in response when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, spoke up with his players on their way to that last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but one would like to start well, as seen at Brookline, as seen at Medina.
When that momentum starts going in one direction, it puts a lot of stress on those middle matches.
We have set up our team accordingly, and have divided the men we felt, you know, to bring us something magical tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and came into the main game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the top half of the classification.
“I chose this group of guys in this order because I think it covers it to the end,” Bjorn said about his single-play choices.
Germany's new warship deferred again
The German military’s latest frigate would have been put into service in 2014 to replace the old warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be there until at least next year, due to faulty systems and growing costs, local media reports.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military spokesman.
This vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the torturous post-delivery issues have plagued the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, a battle order of air defense and anti-ship missiles, as well as several secret technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest fregats for up to two years away from tuishawens.
But continued delays mean that the advanced warships – which apparently will enable Germany to project power overseas – will already become obsolete by the time they enter service, call The Time.
The disastrous F125 frigate made headaches last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media have mentioned that a number of essential “software and hardware defects” render the ship useless if deployed in a campaign.
Software defects are particularly important since the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be handled by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the manpower on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also revealed that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing performance and reducing the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tons "Rhineland-Palatinate" are believed to be twice as heavy as ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag for the entire project – including the training of the crew – also affected a issue.
Apparently it reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – more than the initial €2.2 billion.
Problems that bite the new frigate are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the power of Germany’s fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defense committee, acknowledged that the Navy’s “ships that can be deployed are on the rise.”
The official said the issue had worsened over time, because old ships were decommissioned, but no substitute vessels were supplied.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust listens to bats’ secret life
New research is being conducted on an estate in the Scottish Highlands that aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and soprano dwarf bat as well as the brown long ear and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations on the property to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also do mobile surveys using hand-held indicators.
Expert clan channels of all surveys will check the regularity of the bat screams and determine which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be compiled to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation advisor to NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how it is used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as pasture creation and how to best manage forest lands for bats and other associated species.
Fleas populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by building and development work that affects sleeping and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as well as flying paper and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren’t blind.
But because of their nighttime hunting activities, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-orientation technique to point out goggas and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, is very serious about bats.
It has ten trained experts who regularly do surveys and sleeping spot inspections and sometimes perform rescues.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson said the estate is the ideal site for them.
“Here at Threave we have a wonderful area for bats,” he said.
"We have the old buildings, many lace trees and all the good habitat.
But there’s so much about bats that’s still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He emphasizes the need to look for bats before maintenance in properties is done because it is possible that unwitting destruction of a single birthplace could mean the death of up to 400 females and young ones and could eradicate an entire local population.
Fleas are protected and it is illegal to kill, disturb or prevent them or destroy their sleeping places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to jump in to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don’t know how their populations go.”
Ronaldo completes rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denounced rape allegations against him as “false news” and said that people “want to promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue German news magazine, Der Spiegel, who published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus protagonist was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375 000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
In an Instagram Live video addressing his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were published, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “false news.”
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that’s part of the whole thing.
I’m a happy man and everything is right,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s attorney is preparing to sue Der Spiegel about the claim, which they have called “inadmissible reporting of suspicion in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would claim compensation for “moral damages for any amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was “99 percent” a “good guy” who was abandoned by the “one percent.”
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to police and had photos taken at the hospital of her injuries, but later agreed to a settlement outside the court because she was "fearful of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she wants to reverse the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault and moved this summer, in a €100 million deal, to Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: UK will ‘repent forever’ if their car manufacturers lose
The UK “will regret it forever” if they lose their status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it is "scarring" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it will have to temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese vehicle manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production stopped at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed fears about leaving the EU without a deal and how cross-border trade will function.
BMW, for example, said they would close their Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers say supply chain risks are in the case of a Brexit without a deal.
Toyota’s production line runs on a “just-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border that the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day’s stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be discontinued.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border.”
“We need an agreement. We want the best deal that, as I say, will allow us to enjoy not only the current success, but for us to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“The indications of not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers, are that we absolutely need to continue with what has been an extremely successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be discontinued, but warned that in the long run, added costs could reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite Union’s convener at the plant, says his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have proposed a precise and acceptable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “be postponed by another week” while fighting over nominee for Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh continues, White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia, and possible curbing of law by the president.
Whether or not Trump will resign from the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller’s independence, has fueled Washington’s gossip stories for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a recorder to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was on his way to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would “choose not to thank” Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate court hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh and further postponed the full Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: “A date for that has not yet been determined, it may be this week, I can see that it will be postponed by another week with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists will disagree with that statement: Sanders hasn’t held a White House press information session since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of information sessions isn’t due to a reluctance for TV journalists who are “effect-hunting,” although she said, “I won’t fight with the fact that they are effect-hunting.”
She admitted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more V&A sessions than any president in front of him,” she said, adding without citing evidence: “We looked at the numbers.”
Information sessions will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, then it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We’re trying to do it a lot and you’ve seen us do it a lot in the past few weeks and it’s going to take the place of a press information session when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump frequently answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press releases with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press releases are scarce.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a bizarre appearance in front of journalists gathered.
Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and wish that they would continue after Brexit.
Jeanne Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months left before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of processed status applications for EU citizens working in the delegated public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, on the way to expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to repeat how much I value each employee’s contribution, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service’s work, benefiting the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line player Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation after he sustained a head injury in Saturday’s 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee team’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State Chief Coach Rod Reed told journalists that the injury took place shortly before rest.
“He came to the sidelines and kind of collapsed from just there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline before he was placed on a portable and taken backwards for further evaluation.
An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was from the theater at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet about the type/ extent of the injury” and Tennessee is still trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, an academic second year, was in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He killed five times on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his total for the season at 18.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when buying a property in the UK and the extra cash will be used to help the homeless, according to the new Tory plans
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters
The seal tax will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher seal tax when they buy a property in the UK – with the extra cash that will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The seal tax increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the extra money that will help the government’s plans to counter homelessness.
The surcharge – which is beyond the current seal tax, including the higher levels set two years ago on second homes and homes purchased for rent – can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury estimates that the move can bring in up to 120 million pounds per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK citizens who push prices and make it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing door.
Many wealthy areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost towns” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a cut in seal tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by picking up land but not using it and encouraged Mrs. May to give up quotas on affordable homes to repair Britain’s “housing disaster.”
Mr. Corbyn announced an astonishing series of proposed housing improvements, including rental control and an end to “no-error expulsions.”
He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means restoring our broken home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can’t be right that it’s just as easy for individuals who don’t live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream and the humiliation of homelessness a too great reality.
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest ambition is to run Scotland’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “greatest ambition” is to become the manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scottish, 42, enjoys the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East team, which is currently in third place in League One, three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country.
I made the second team, but it was already,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
"But as a child, I often watched Scotland at Hampden with my father and that's something that pulls me back.
The opportunity, however, can only come if I am successful with club management.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss said he feels no anxiety about following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success will be measured for me by ''Can I make this club return to the Premier League?''
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get it there, but I’ll probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club out there again.”
Ross’s career in management is only three years, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month period on Hearts’s coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa return from relegation to the third league and converted St Mirren from on the verge of relegation to winners of the Championship title in the next season.
And Ross says he now feels more comfortable than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he says as he reflects on how he took over Alloa’s leads.
“I really believed the management was the right place for me, even more than to play.
This sounds bisar, because I did well enough, made a reasonable existence out of it and experienced reasonable highlights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things that a person has to do every week.
I’m still going through this with regard to the stress and pressure of work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to drive and now I do it, it feels the most comfortable thing I’ve been in my own skin throughout my adult life.”

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, find survey
The summer heat wave improved Britain’s struggling bars’ income, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Drinking places and bar groups saw sales rise by 2.7% in July – but revenues in restaurants were down by 4.8%, figures showed.
Peter Martin, from business consulting firm CGA, who compiled the figures, says: “Continued sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as the previous month, June, when drinking spots were down by 2.8 percent, except that restaurants were hit even heavier.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant trade in June only worsened in July.
Beverage-led drinking sites and bars did far better and rose more than restaurants had dropped.
Food-guided drinking sites also suffered in the sun, but not as badly as restaurant operators
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Around managed bars and drinking sites have increased sales by 6.6 percent for the month, with food washing down by three percent.”
Paul Newman, of recreational and hospitality analysts RSM said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since late April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.
It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a decline in sales of 4.8 percent year on year will be particularly difficult above and apart from ongoing expense pressure.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-guided operators and only time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we have experienced since August will bring necessary relief.”
Total sales growth across drinking sites and restaurants, including new places that opened up, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Monitor for the UK’s drinking area, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 industry groups, with a combined turnover of more than $9 billion and is the well-established benchmark in the industry.

A survey of 20,000 high school students has revealed rapid growth in “false Insta accounts” – a reference to the photo sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of learners said they had a clean “head account” to show for parents, but also have private accounts.
One mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site found a teenager who urged others to “rape” her.
The research, at Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s troubling that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t track them down.”
Eilidh Doyle will be “voting for athletes” on Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body’s Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated track-and-field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie has described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her far-reaching international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has great respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletic community and we are sure athletics in Scotland will benefit a lot from what she brings to the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I’m eager to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help to lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who scored the 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta under his four gold Olympic medals, is now a regular BBC connoisseur, could not walk after having had a brief ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “Today I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
Doctors said only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but it has fully recovered, once again learned how to walk and do dexterity exercises today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Breast pump ad comparing moms to cows divide opinions online
A breast pump company divided opinions online with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
In celebration of the launch of what is called “the world’s first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie released a tongue-in-the-choice music video-inspired ad to show the freedom that the pump gives to mothers milking out.
Four real moms dancing in a barn full of straw and cows to match a song that includes lyrics like, “Yes, I milk myself, but you can’t see a tail” and “In case you haven’t seen, it’s not udders, it’s my breasts.”
The choir part reads, “Pump it out, pump it out, I carry the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
But the ad published on the company’s Facebook page caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from viewers, with many saying it underplays the “grieves” of the dairy industry.
“Very poor decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like we need to conceive and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are often stolen from them within days of giving birth,” one wrote.

Another one remarked: “Understandably traumatic for mom and baby.
But yes, why not use it to advertise a breast pump to moms who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “The ad is so out of touch.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that the song was "screaming funny" to her.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have had one if I was still breastfeeding.
Milk made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I accepted it for what it is.
It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another person noted: “This is a fun ad aimed at moms who are milking out (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like “cows.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discrete pump in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is deadly silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are milking out.
Ana Balarin, partner and UKD at Mother noted: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it earned a big and engaging launch.
By drawing a parallel between women milking out and dairy cows, we wanted to put the milking out process and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining way that people can connect with the wonderful sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn’t the first time the Elvie pump has picked up the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the board for designer Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to fierce rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that make it harder to place children at sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that their own ability to stay in the country would be jeopardized by stepping forward to claim a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement before Congress, testified that the agency arrested thousands of people who applied to sponsor unsuspected minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have previous criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal foreigners.
That is why we continue to persecute those individuals," Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to process the children faster, officials introduced new rules that would require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to advocate their case for legal status at an immigration judge.
Those who are considered unsuitable for relief will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent eruptions or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers say those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs of a child struggling are more easily overlooked due to its size.
They added that moving the children to the tent village without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally to say goodbye to friends can worsen the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish ‘occupation forces’ to withdraw immediately
When addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s war is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as Deputy Prime Minister, said the foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be “handled accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more displaced, is “almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territories” from both terror groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces as well as Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France with over 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
Concerning the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were in order for them to return, and he blamed “some Western countries” for spreading “irrational fears that urge refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They politicize something that should simply be a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel fortress of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has repelled a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including warriors from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front who would be “cut off.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem has prescribed conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee and said the panel’s work should be limited to “checking the articles of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will win the re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, a state of accusation and scandals end his presidency early.
In what will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!”
To date, there are no signs of watcher fatigue.
Since 2014, peak-time viewing rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CCN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNCBC.
Fox News has an average 2.4 million peak time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of cable viewing rates with as many as 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
“This is a fire people are attracted to because it’s not something we understand,” says Neal Baer, program manager of the ABC drama “Designated Survivor” about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congress building.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
She remembered a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There’s a lot of fun in this chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the storylines that come from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, or immigrant families can reunite and the health of the world economy.
Eliminating is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond just being an informed citizen when you’re in the sixth hour of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” from his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather jacket (“a garment thick of the hubris,” The Washington Post said in shock.
I will never watch Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, head of industry at Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump program’s varying role-sharing and daily twists in the plot (like seeking quarrel with N.F.L., Kim Jong-un at price).
You can’t afford to miss one episode, or you’ll be left behind.
When I reached for Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 80 degrees outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was inside looking at MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not tear him away, not with Brett Kavanaugh on his way to appear before the Senate Court and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we did all those crazy programs at the time and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but now it seems they were right.”

Expense stream to most exciting mid-term election races in Home
It’s not surprising that Pennsylvania’s 17th sees an influx of money, thanks to a shift of congressional districts that has now led two office-bearers into a race around the same seat.
The recently changed suburban Pittsburg district allows Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb – who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring – to measure forces.
Lamb stands against another official, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th.
The cards were revoked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally demarcated in the Republican favor.
The race in the new 17th kicked off with a campaign funding competition between the major parties’ financial legs, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a nail scratch winning in a widely watched special election in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. Considered Penalizing El Salvador Rather Than Supporting China, But Turned Back
Diplomats have noticed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization’s management team.
State department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads from diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama over the “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” the department’s spokesperson Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed fines, which include reductions in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be difficult for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, only North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level congress and focused on security and economic progress to follow up on a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administrative officials made it clear that they wanted Congress to continue effectively ending any consideration of fines for El Salvador.
Deputy President Mike Pence is now destined to address Congress, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the severity of the assembly for the administration, the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned silently to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton did not want to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberation on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst who was close to the administration and also talked about the condition of anonymity.
Study History
The next thing that could happen could be the special deliberation on Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible curbing of justice, of which there is now much significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also presumably focusing his investigation on whether Mr. Trump’s campaign with Russia has cooperated in the country’s attack on our elections.
If Congress passes into other hands, Mr. Trump will have to face liability in that body, just as he prepares to go back in front of the voters, and perhaps eventually in front of a jury of his peer group.
It’s a bunch of axes, and I don’t want to imply that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable – nor that of his peers in Europe.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how much the battle can be stretched out.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, if only the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovakia at Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and democracy’s ruthless course is hastened or delayed.
Americans are now staring at several such turning points in the face.
What will we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since this newspaper reported that last year he proposed taking the president in secret and speculating on whether he was qualified for his office.
Mr. Rosenstein says The Times’ report is inaccurate.
“How will we react if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly requested FBI investigation is not complete or fair – or if he is being tried in the Supreme Court despite credible charges of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm election for a congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we follow those tests, there is a long winter ahead for democracy.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who once lived in my ambassador’s house.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on that table wearing the swastika.
With this as my origin, how can I not be an optimist about our future?”

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimism for Rapid Vienna battle
Rangers play hosts for Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season into the 2-2 match result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a jumping-off place for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game with the belief that we could get something and walked away there with a point.
Maybe we could have won it in the end, but a drawdown is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is a big day for Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game because they’ve had a good result in their last game, but with the crowd on our side, I’m sure we can push through and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes at the club, but there is now a feel-good factor on the spot.
The group is good and the men really enjoy it; the coaching is good.
Hopefully we can now push through, sit behind us last season and be successful.”
Women lose sleep over this retirement savings fear
Despite the fact that survey participants have a clear idea of how they want to be cared for, few people talk to their relatives about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to have the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your spouse and the children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes long before the time.
Work with your adviser and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.
Your funding decisions for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own capabilities – as long as you have the money.
Work out your legal documents: Cut off legal battles by the pass.
Get a health care proxy in place so you can assign a trusted individual to supervise your medical care and ensure that experts fulfill your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
You also need to pay for your finances.
You must choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your accounts are paid if you are incompetent.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Play out those details in a written plan so you are ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that are at stake, but who are the doctors?” asks Martin.
What is the medication?
Who will care for the dog?
Make sure that plan is in place.”
Man shot several times in Ilfracombe with wind bucks
A man was shot several times with a bucket when he walked home after a night out.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police asked for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications put out of action, relief officials could not get any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the center of the 7.5-scale shake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were taken to safety after the disaster struck.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, located on the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck them.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the cornerstones of the central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996 and caused nine deaths.
Indonesia sits on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major shaking along the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December resulted in a tsunami hitting 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the Indian Ocean coast, with more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong shakes struck the western coast of Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, resulting in a tsunami that hit the southern coast and caused nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6-squake hit near the city of Padang, capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5-sized quake hit one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, resulting in a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of towns and led to about 300 deaths.
2016: A level shake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh and led to destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly shake and tsunami in 2004.
This time it didn’t lead to a tsunami, but more than 100 were killed due to buildings that crashed,
2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, with more than 500 deaths, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report issued by Alaska State Police on Saturday.
According to the police report, he took a female acquaintance’s phone from her when she called the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is in custody at Mat-Su Pre-trial facility and is held on a $500 unsecured deposit, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared “innocent, ruling” when asked what he was advocating, the network reported.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with a class B offense, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is before Alaska's Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference with the report of a crime of domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while drunk, in connection with the incident.
His wife claimed that he had caught her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son’s behavior to PTSD as a result of his duty in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-sized earthquake led to a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks have been put off of action with mortality rates expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspect in NYC terrorist attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death sentence for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that caused eight people’s deaths – a rare punishment not yet executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan to kill pedestrians and a cyclist who was in his way in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors would have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to ask for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury beat Saipov with 22 charges, which included eight charges of murder in favor of extortion, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “deep planning and preconceivedness,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “horrible, cruel and perverse.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the intentional notice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since the Southern District of New York legally prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009 for the murder of two drug providers.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were put to death after being sentenced for a conspiracy to carry out spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenberges were tear-set with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the charges.
He also asked to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal pro-Deo lawyers representing Saipov, said they were “naturally disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to desire the death penalty rather than accepting a debt recognition to life imprisonment with no possible release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be placed in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage made a vow to mobilize “the people’s army” during a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the “heat” of Eurosceptics – since one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back banker Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK would be “out” by the time Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May to unite her deeply divided officers was pointed out by pro-Roman Tories by joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks by Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would press through in her attempt to make a deal with Brussels despite the death row – forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and ‘chaos’.
Mr. Bone said for the Walk Meaning Walking event in Solihull that he wanted to “throw out Chequers”.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been made a nobleman and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we would have been out by the time,” he said.
The Wellingborough-LP added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we must throw out Chequers.”
He outlined his opposition to the EU, saying: “We did not fight world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own bets in our own country.”
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march and told reporters: “I simply say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular with our party and our activists who actually bomb the streets and make sure we are chosen in the first place.
Please let Chequers go and start listening.”
In a direct message to Mrs. May, she added: “First ministers must keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr. Farge said the congressional politicians should feel the “heat” if they were on the threshold of wanting to violate the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now about a trust issue between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘we won’t let you get away with it.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, who is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud UK.”
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a meeting for two hours in the city centre.
A few activists have waved Tories against Brexit banners after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour nobleman Lord Adonis spotted the conservatives for the security issues they endured with a party application such as the conference opened.
“It is the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus in place, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a smart overall.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Look Hard After’ to Stand for President
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will “look hard to stand for president” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent criticism of President Donald Trump, stands for re-election in November against GOP state Rep Geoff Diehl who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She is already in the middle of speculation that she may be challenging Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the city hall format since Trump was in power.
A resident asked her if she was planning to stand for the president.
Warren responded that it was time “for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman very high up.”
Arrested in shooting of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayne Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying a man who had been seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed early on Friday near Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims had a gunshot wound in the head and was eventually killed as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on 247sports Saturday.
Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was on the scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and arrested at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6-foot-6 youth who grew up in Baton Rouge played Sims in 32 games with 10 lead last season, maintaining an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 return balls per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton finishes world title after team orders give him his win over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday when Mercedes’ team orders would play a major role in the races.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost won for Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first into the pits and left Hamilton to get into the back of the bunch of traffic, something that must have been decisive.
The Mercedes pulled a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced to wheel-to-wheel action which the Ferrari driver reluctantly risk-freely saw leaving the inside at risk of endurance to a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the jumping grid and was seventh by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the races as he clung to his ties to finish quickly and cross Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He may have entered the wells on the 44th round, but could not speed up his pass in the remaining eight rounds as Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was said that it was a difficult day because Valtteri did fantastic things all weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team has done exceptional work to have a one-two,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for not licking Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
The president spoke at a meeting in Western Virginia and did not directly address the testimony that Ford had given before the Senate Legal Committee. Instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were “common and rude and liars.”
“The one thing that can happen and the sweet thing that went on in the Senate over the past few days, when you see the anger, when you see people who are evil and mean and liars,” he said.
“When you look at statements and leaks and then they say ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn’t do that.”
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lick?
Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t lick it.”
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't do it," he added, in a speech from the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter that outlined the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak had come off her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s accusations. I didn’t lick her story,” Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
But the president did not appreciate her denial well and commented during Saturday night's assembly: "I tell you what. It was utterly bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused by three women of sexual misconduct and suggested that the Democrats use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back with any necessary means.
You see the meanness, the unholyness, they don’t care who hurts them, who they have to circumvent to gain power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer threw two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars reconciled for Friday’s Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two-goal lead by throws from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made the home team equal before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who first lost games and then won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's open ball came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull aid, with David Rutherford offering the help when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became the provider for Cownie's equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break when he threw his second goal from the evening at the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again scored a draw with a power game goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half and he made sure he won with his team’s fifth point halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds on plane can escape earthquake
A air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero after he died when he made sure that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people died and more are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
There are still strong aftershocks in the area and many are trapped in demolitions in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that was heavily swinging at SIS Al-Jufri airport in Palu.
He remained immovable to make sure that the Batik Air flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, was able to safely ascend.
He then jumped off the traffic control tower when it collapsed.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia’s ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are breaking to hear about this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country’s disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
“It is believed that the death toll is still increasing as many bodies are still below the building pits while many cannot yet be reached,” agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching up to six meters snatched Palu who would hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute brings in an ambulance bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-market is looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is chasing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military service: “I ask almaI of you to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation.
“Are you ready?” the CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier this year in Lombok where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia Airplane Accident: Air Niugini Says One Man Is Missing After Beach Lake Airplane Accident
The airline that handled a flight that crashed into a Pacific beach lake in Micronesia now says one man was missing after they earlier said that all 47 passengers and crew safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they could not give an account of a male passenger.
The airline said that they worked with local authorities, hospitals, and detectives to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the collapse and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed near the runway in the beach lake.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had passed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and the others managed to walk through medium deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said that the air guards panicked and screamed and that he had suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that ships working near the improvement of a quay also helped with the rescue by an inflatable boat to get people back and forth before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in the past two decades in collapses of PNG-registered airlines, but Air Niugini has been involved in one.
Analysts set timeline of night that woman was burned alive
The state closed its case on Saturday in the retrial of a man charged with burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett witnessed for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to put together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from various cell phones that showed Tellis was together with Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous allegations, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the time he said he was at his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “joking because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers' death, Tellis Chambers had deleted messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He's taken her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing ceremonies on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative outlook of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip-hop has moved away from its origins of political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to the foundations and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK by artists like Akala and Lowkey.
A black person?
NY toddler's wife sues couple for having been sacked after "racist" text
A New York children’s wife sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misaddressed message from the mother who complained that she was “another black person.”
The couple deny that they are racist and compare the case to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, aired her dismay when she learned that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“No, no, no, no, no,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After finding out about her error, an “uncomfortable” Plasco-Flaxman dismissed me Maurice and said that their outgoing childhood teacher who was African-American was doing bad work and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Me Maurice was paid for one day’s work and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for damages over the dismissal and seeks his damages up to the amount of $350 per day for the six months, inhabiting job for which she was initially appointed, although it was without a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you’re not doing that good,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know that’s discrimination.”
The couple retaliated on the allegations of being racist, saying that it was the reasonable thing to end Maurice’s employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you were rude with, even if it had been by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the matter to “extortion,” saying that his wife would have had a baby in two months and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to find someone?
It’s not a very nice thing to do,” the investment banker added.
While the lawsuit continues, the court of public opinion had been quick to put the couple on social media and hijack them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington publishers feared that a talking bear would not connect readers
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s very entertaining that we know of Paddington’s great success.”
She said her father would have been fierce if his work had been rejected. He had been a BBC cameraman before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little toy bear. She added that the 60th anniversary of the book's announcement after his death was "bitter-sweet" last year.
About Paddington, who she describes as a “very important member of our family,” she added that her father was silently proud of his enduring success.
“He was quite a quiet man and he was not an apple-like man,” she said.
But because Paddington was genuine to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something: you are proud of them, even if it’s not your job.
I think he viewed Paddington’s success kind of that way.
Though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the honor to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to greet her over the phone.
When she landed, her daughter was chased to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 hospital where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad frequently called to say that it was really bad, that they didn’t expect her to make it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got the call from Nad to say that she would die within the next two minutes and that I should have greeted her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, heart pal.
I will soon be with you.
I will be with you.
The medicine that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly getting up and leaving her system.
She was a while before it died and the body was closing down.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that it was unfolding.
I couldn’t yell or cry or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to take it.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was hurt by the loss of her daughter at the time, boarded the plane with the other passengers - unaware of the ordeal she had gone.
“No one knew,” she said.
“I dropped my head and the tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but I got an overwhelming sympathy for Nad on the flight.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Mourning women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge for a while with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Ms. Davis’ son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Me Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened any room.”
However, he gave up work before he died because he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Me Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that there’s going to be a domino effect.”
Me Davis designed the cards, “to let people know that there are people out there who you can go to and with whom you can talk, even if it’s a friend.
“Don’t sit in silence – you have to talk.”
Me Humphreys, who has been a friend of Me Davies for years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old husband, not long after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he was feeling sick or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He reached the lowest point on Christmas – when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t make eye contact or anything with them.”
She said her death had been very traumatic for them, but that they had to work through it: “It rips a hole through the family.
It tears us apart.
But we all have to go and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still indefinite as FBI investigation begins
“I thought if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a timeless investigation that didn’t include – we might bring some unity,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “falling apart” under entrenched partisan congestion.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want to have the FBI investigated?
Their reluctance is all due to timing.
The midterm elections are only weeks away, on 6 November – if, as is expected, the Republicans go badly, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to elect to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called senators to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House and who through him met his wife Ashley and was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happened after the FBI released the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which will allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a draw and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'Down' Numbers Under Kim
The number of North Korean overshoots to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-sug quoted data from the Southern Unification Cabinet, saying that last year there were 1,127 spillovers – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by human traffickers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
The vast majority of overshoots from the North are finally offered South Korea citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flights are via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the highly protective demilitarized zone (DMS) between the two Koreas.
China considers the defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South – who are still technically at war with each other – have improved noticeably in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered around the staking negotiations on the removal of nuclear weapons.
This came after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore when they agreed in broad terms to work together for the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi Calls Brett Kavanaugh “Histerious,” Says He Is Incapable of Serving on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh “history” and said he was temperamentally incapable of serving on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the commentary in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had ever acted this way, they would say ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied emotional allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh had been very emotional and at times almost screamed and suffocated while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “ridiculous and coordinated character sniffing murder,” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was prejudiced against Democrats.
“I think he makes himself incompetent with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to sue Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if Democrats won the majority in the Lower House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Ommegang Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he was considered a conservative right.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘It’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to handle this.
It’s a just diatribe, months and years of anger that boils over, and she can’t get out of it without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, do you?”
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who also said that she cried when she got angry but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would have said to the person she was talking to, “You may think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just went on.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are permissible as a partial exit for toom because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office is where I once found myself crying with nameless anger and being grabbed by my neck by an older woman – a cold manager I was a little scared of – who dragged me into a stairway.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and will be happy because they’ve had an effect on you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and he had to leave the races, Schroeder, very frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she could not investigate the idea that she could run for president.
“I didn’t think well about the decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind with finds and so she made a vow that she would not enter the races unless she raised $2 million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that of her supporters who gave men $1,000, she would only give $250.
“Do they think I get discounts?” she wondered.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions – grateful for the people who supported her, frustrated with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters as delegates, and anger at sexism – that she suffocated.
You would have thought that I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled about how the press responded to her.
“You would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my gravestone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-Sjina Trade War Could Be Good for Beijing
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China have been devastating, and while the battle is far from over, a dispute between the countries may be beneficial in the long run for Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week rolled in with new rates affecting $200 trillion ($150 trillion) of items and effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing retaliated each time in goods and recently slapped rates of five to ten percent on $60 trillion of US goods.
China has promised to match the US shot-by-shot and the world’s largest economy will not move soon.
To get Washington to stand back means to surrender to requests, but to publicly comply with the US’s requests will be too much of a embarrassment for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
Experts continue to say that if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure on US trade war over long-term China can support positively by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a swift political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the conditions that can start an economic toll flight in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than spectators have previously confessed,” said Abigail Grace, a research assistant who focuses on Asia in the midst of New American Security, a thinker.
Syria ‘ready’ for refugees to return, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a war for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in combating terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to restore the areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and the one-sided economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war started in 2011.
A further six million people who still live in the country need philanthropic assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance to rebuild the devastated land.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that sponsored the invasion.
Europe seals Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Rider Cup and defeated Team USA with a final point of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not yet won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s team scored the 14.5 points they needed to win the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, plunged his T-hold into the water at par-3 16th hole and surrendered his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has blinked in all his rounds and has become one of the 1-of-4 players to go 5-0-0 ever since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the player with the lowest rank on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The player with the world's highest rank, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to land Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, has become the tournament's European winner of all times with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It was a rough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for what he has done for me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m glad I could help,” said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch over to his compatriot John Ram who won US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single game on Sunday.
The incredible pride I feel in overcoming Tiger Woods, I grew up and looked at that old man,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all time and he won 14 major titles second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to find the clean field all weekend with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke on behalf of his team after a disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys. They fought.
There was a time when we put a little heat on Europe.
We got rid of it.
Watch out for Thomas.
He is a wonderful captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup. I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to serve as their captain.
You have to wear your hat.
We are in awe.”
