One experimental vaccine seems to be able to reduce Ebola deaths, but so far, no drugs have been clearly suited to treat existing infections.
A cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, was initially promising in the field. However, official studies showed that it had fewer benefits than desired in preventing people from dying.
ZMapp was a control in the PALM trial, so scientists used it as a baseline and compared the three other treatment methods with it.
The U.S. Olympic Committee has the support of USA Gymnastics and understands the need for the Olympic family to promote a safe place for all athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s statement that it is best for our athletes and clubs, and their sport, to make meaningful changes in our organization rather than take certifications.

This not only proves the already widespread theory that in any case certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
. According to scientists, the feathercloth of this animal was chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid-colored bottom.
The finding also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or rachis, but do have other features of feathers - such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used to fly, but to regulate the temperature or what it looked like. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this sample shows mature feathers and not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that despite the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample had an adult's feathercloth and not the down of a chick.

This showed that the sun follows the same basic principles as other stars: all star activity in the galaxy is based solely on the brightness and rotation of the stars.
The brightness and rotation are used to determine the number of Rossby of a star. This is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the number of Rossby waves, the less active the star is when it comes to magnetic reversals.

The annoyances within the community resulted in current attempts to draft a policy regarding the site’s sexual content that hosts millions of pieces of open-licensed media content.
The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the galaxy.
Similar to how the moon exerts force on Earth, leading to tides, the Milky Way exerts force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is around, in a kind of circle, and consists of a large amount of smaller particles.

In France, there is usually hardly any need for votes: voters go into a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope that says which candidate they vote for.
Officials first check the identity of the voter. Then the voter slides the envelope into the ballot box and then puts his signature under the ballot roll.
The process is relatively tightly enshrined in the electoral law of France.
Since 1988, polls must be transparent so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the start of the vote and that no envelopes other than those of registered and authorized voters are added.
The candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

According to Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya, five of the Swedish woman’s rapists have been arrested and found her cell phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to Great Yarmouth, James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court for murdering her son.
She is in custody awaiting the indictment and trial, but the eyewitness report may have been obscured because her story has been widely published.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have labeled the publication of photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that “journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photographs of suspects.”
Crown Office is in charge of prosecutions and has informed journalists that no further statements will be made, at least until charges have been filed.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted because of the borders before the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed include the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there be a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after signing an agreement, but the PA is only prepared for a five-year presence.
Shooters in the additional pest control trial had to be closely monitored by forest guards, because the test was followed and its effectiveness was assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters for the first shooting operation had an extensive safety and training instruction.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved a CEP five times in the past four years.
Last month, the presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous National Electoral Council, which is part of a package of measures to bring about new elections in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests resulted from the absence of elections, some of which had to take place since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods that overheat have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was familiar with the 27 accidents associated with the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called “not serious.”
"Very deplorable," the ministry said in response to Apple postponing the report.
Mariana was hit by the earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The disaster management agency of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage has been reported nationwide.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippine capital, a former policeman from the Philippines has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been taken to safety and at least six deaths have been confirmed.
Six hostages were previously released, including the children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers returned in exchange for an elderly woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went to work in medicine, following the example of his father.
He was trained as a midwife in 1959 at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working in the hospital, Liggins did research on premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by administering a hormone.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two “black boxes” of flight recorders on Wednesday.
Contestants also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first 'Queen of Extreme'. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. As unique as she was. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm going to miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people polled for the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Resigning Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this position and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last prince of Australia.
29 percent of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent said that it should never happen.
The Olympic winner of the gold medal swam the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relay matches during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He could not take the drugs he needed to ease his pain, because they were banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the currently largest known prime number.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into how planets are formed, especially as they want to know how the Earth was created, given the fact that it has been a long time since comets have collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month that legalizes same-sex marriages.
He called the gossip “political nonsense and gossip.”
It is speculated that he wants to run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes, saving millions of tons of fuel annually for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground radar technologies, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and provide pilots with clearer information.
There is no additional transport and no above-ground trains stop at Wembley; in addition, the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on site.
A possible lack of transport increased the chances that the match would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published Tuesday in the scientific journal Science was about the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process took much longer as crossing an indigenous Darwinian finch, the Middle Ground finch, with an immigrated Cactus Ground finch, the Espanola Ground finch, lasted longer.
Gold can be processed into many shapes. It can be rolled up in small shapes.
It can be pulled into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled into plates.
After making it very thin, it can be pasted onto another metal, even so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called "enlightened manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Then the color of the cabbage juice changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The pH value is indicated on the basis of the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical that has been tested.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands and make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the towns of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flushing toilet that was connected to an advanced sewer system.
Wastewater residues have been found in homes in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Furthermore, there were already toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in ancient times. For example, toilets in the Roman era were often part of a popular bathhouse, in which both ladies and gentlemen came together in a mixed group.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it is immediately returned.
Scientists use telescopes in space, because the atmosphere of the Earth distorts part of our light and image.
To power a satellite or telescope in space, you need to have a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly. The most important thing the wheel has given us is easier and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are cats of average size between those prey of average size eating, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as loose cats that are kept as pets) who hunt for larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are family and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are usually closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A bunch of lions behaves pretty much the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that look surprisingly like lions (but not like other large cats), and that are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (though not good), swim, jump long distances and has five times as much traction as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar like a lion, it's more like groaning a whole sentence.
The favorite meal of ocelots are small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they succeed. The ocelot almost exclusively hunts animals that are much smaller than he himself is.
Scientists suspect that ocelots use their smell to hunt small animals (their prey) by smelling to the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark by night vision and move very unobtrusively. Ocelots hunt for prey by making one with the environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) detaches from the large population from which they come (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or if they are moved to another island, from where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are other resources and other enemies, so the new population needs to change attitudes or adapt to cope with competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also began to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different in appearance that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Species formation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people inhale and they take in carbon dioxide that people exhale.
By means of photosynthesis, the plants extract their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our homes and clothing are made of plants. We mainly eat plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was at the top of the food chain at that time, and he had nothing to fear from anyone but from other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 razor-sharpen teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, meaning nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not sure, but maybe his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs and maybe even his own species mates.
In waterfalls, nothing was safe from the attacks; even giant dinosaurs such as the Tyrannosaurus Rex were not a party for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called a sleeping mouse.
In addition, there was another difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to have a banquet together where they lay on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals do not contain food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods. This temple was seen as the god’s own house.
They offered sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a backroom that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers were built in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not very important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
According to Norwegian legends, Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on its way west and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but there were Eskimo tribes there at the time.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the persons, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different from each other.
After the movie National Treasure, you may think there is a treasure map at the back of the Declaration of Independence.
There is something written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence are the words "Original American Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is at the bottom of the document.
Although no one is sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (from 293 x 4 inches by 241 x 2 inches) was rolled up for storage in the past.
So it seems that the designation is simply added as a kind of label.
Due to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated, but the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were Frenchmen who sided with the Germans in 1940 and so cried with the enemy instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies with Operation Dragoon invaded southern France.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France in just two weeks, then they set off for Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, meaning civil, comes the term civilization, related to the Latin civis, which in turn stands for citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state; and that also defines in a certain way the format of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced dissemination.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence, so they are not officially recognized as civilizations.
During the revolution, thirteen states under the articles of the Confederacy formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes because there was no national executive or judiciary and for the execution of all decisions relied on state authorities who often did not want to cooperate.
It also did not have the power to ignore tax laws and tariffs between states.
At first, all states had to unanimously agree to the articles before they could be modified, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team, is the second most successful team worldwide and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, swordfighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest island), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster/group of islands Japan possesses, Japan is geographically often referred to as a 'peninsula'.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed along the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself as a base in the southwest of Taiwan, where the VOC tackled the indigenous grain production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In the year 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan were conquered by Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, in which sovereignty over Taiwan was transferred to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Constructed of three large structures, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists get a better idea of what they looked like before.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored in 1976, and the renovation is still underway.
For example, the most common photo format for stationary images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the usual film format in the end of the analogue film age.
These are produced to this day, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that the image sensor of the digital camera took over.
Strangely enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The ratio of this size (divide by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) would be 3:2 in that case.
Many common formats (for example, APS-like formats) are equal to or a dense approach to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is widely misused and ridiculed by many, is a simple guideline that makes the image dynamic and yet clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. For example, divide the image vertically and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states, despite language differences and customs.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his all-pervading power affected everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that prosperity must be used to fight suffering and poverty, and for this reason the church has funds.
The church has been the central authority in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to begin to doubt whether this principle was observed.
Britain imposed a sea blockade directed against Germany, just after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy turned out to be effective because it was no longer possible to provide vital provisions for military and civilians, but this blockade violated the generally accepted international law that has been enshrined in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has placed mines in international waters so that ships could no longer sail in entire parts of the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country’s uninhibited subsea warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States in 1884 to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he had only 4 cents, a bunch of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different periods of time; each phase of China or every ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The most famous was the era of the Three Kingdoms, this took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasty.
At that time, there were fierce wars between different nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had major social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism, and the notion that the country belongs to its inhabitants rather than to a single leader.
For all male applicants, post-revolution positions were to be obtained, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The military ranks are no longer based on a person's class, but on the caliber of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class to revolutionize in other countries.
Mohammed dealt intensively with super-earth issues and often went to reflect on a cave that later became known as the Cave of Hira in the Mountains of Noer.
The cave itself, which has endured the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave is located on one of mountain peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Even if it was known that the cave existed, it was not at all easy to find. Once inside the cave there is total isolation.
The only thing to see is the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little to see or hear from this world from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza remains the only one of the seven wonders of the world.
The Great Pyramid was built in the third century BC by the Egyptians and is one of the numerous large pyramid structures in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Plateau of Giza or 'Pyramids of Giza' in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the large sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in tribute to the women and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow sign looks like a V and the down-bow sign looks like a staple or a square whose bottom is missing.
Above means that you have to start at the point and push the ironing rod away. Below means that you have to start at the arch frog (the place where your hand holds the ironing rod) and put the ironing rod on.
An upward movement usually gives a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to sketch your personal characters, but remember that the printed strings are there for a musical reason, so they usually need to be respected.
A group of market women sat behind the departure of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage, surrounded by joking and threatening mobs who threatened the King's couple.
Due to the actions of the crowd, the king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, someone in the crowd held up the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles before the eyes of a terrified queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism related to the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the U.S. colonial regime to pay taxes to finance much of the cost and interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
American imperialism rested to a large extent on the enormous gains of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
In order to understand the Templars, one must know the context that gave rise to the creation of the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages, which were again followed by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology offerings or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have these two general notions: the development of technology follows a path that for the most part extends beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has ‘effects’ on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically feasible for just a few cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also causes a greater number of road accidents and this leads to the development of new health care techniques to restore the human body.
Romance included a large part of cultural determinism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romanticism, geography formed the individual and over time customs and cultures emerged as a result of this geography, which formed a harmonious society and were better than the arbitrary laws imposed.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known from about 400 AD to about 1100 AD as an epicenter of luxury.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic celebrated its heyday in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was initially heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west fell by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments was the result of the Crusades: people began to use buttons to attach their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture with the purpose of livelihoods is a simple system that is usually organic. Here, stored seeds are used that come from the ecoregion, and that is combined with varying crops or other relatively simple techniques to maximize the yield.
In the past, most farmers worked in self-sufficient agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded people who feel neglected are brought together by social norms. This gives them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following types of qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors together.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most commonly used methods for illustrating the importance of socialization was the few lamentable cases of children who were not socialized by adults due to neglect, setbacks or deliberate abuse while growing up.
They are called "wolf children" or "wild children". Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents did not want to accept the severe mental or physical impairment of the child.
Uncontrollable children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
A wild child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior similar to the behavior of the animal that the child has taken care of (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference to people.
Learning on a project basis should simplify and make education more interesting, but scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who are dealing with a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or who are starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but the paper clip man of Microsoft Office is.
There is virtual scaffolding built into the software that asks questions, provides memory support and explains procedures that can be difficult to understand for students without help.
There are several reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not properly cared for, where they are not cared for and where they cannot develop, but this is still happening.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
Nursing care is intended to ensure a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable healthcare.
In nursing care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the Internet, parts of interpersonal and mass communication are merged.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as “personal engagement” and “persistent relationships” when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can recognize a lie by looking only at micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President’s Speech how it is possible that people who cannot understand that speech because of brain damage can accurately estimate its sincerity.
He even suggested that other animal species, such as house dogs, also have the ability to interpret people’s behavior.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection, this variation is eliminated from the pole of expressed variation.
For each generation, separation and recombination are varied between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans can get the necessary amino acids from the plant sources found there.
Furthermore, it can not have serious consequences: growth delay, malnutrition and ultimately even death.
The easiest to find plant sources are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless cooked, they are difficult to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) slightly digestible, but it also contains very many proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their “protein problem” in the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and that you fall asleep again within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without you waking up all the time.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way you have to get out of your bed to turn it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm are, for example, drinking a lot of liquid before going to sleep (and especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic).
The amount of inner calm that a person has is compared to the amount of stress that a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force present. Every person is able to achieve satisfaction and total peace.
Anyone can relieve his or her mind. Only your own stress and negativity are in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its foundation in the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been extended with the Mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and an imitation of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini yoga (enlightening energy) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as its focus. Using the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, a cooperation between the USSR and the US was established. When the war ended, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to quarrel with each other.
The former allies stood close to each other two years after the end of the war, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last 40 years, and fighting with proxy armies took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defence forces lasted only until September 17, 1939, after which they had to retreat and reorganize along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were outdated in one night, when 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army invaded the Soviet Union and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after they occupied the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Goods transport by ship is the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the task of the navy to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while effectively hampering the enemy’s ability to transport people and goods.
The U.S. was trying to get men and materials across the Atlantic to the British, and with this World War II North Atlantic campaign, this is one of the most notable recent examples.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the kids were domesticated for the first time in the Iranian Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily get to them, meat, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goat shepherds, just like the more well-known shepherd often a child or younger. Today, they are still kept in the same way.
Horse-drawn railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although horse railroads consisted only of a rail of shelves, the horses had to walk faster and attract larger quantities than on the somewhat difficult roads of the time.
Crossbars were used fairly early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if an iron point was present on the top.
This soon became the usual practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were built.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus emerged (that is, upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, was less likely to walk upright.
In fossils of the Australopithecus of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, two-legged specializations are found. The Sahelanthropus, by the way, ran on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement or even take action to mitigate suffering in the future.
In many cases, it is like a symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to identify the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have markedly changed the earth, and overpopulation and the extravagant human way of life have exacerbated the problems.
After the Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten design was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away, signed by Continental Congress President John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon held the public reading of the document for the first time on July 8 at Independence Hall Gardens.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6 and read to his troops in New York on July 9, while another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap flyers are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that a species of dinosaur still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them to be dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind of a dinosaur.
On their legs are claws and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulation of data encoded in binary numerals forms the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can have only two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made directly.
The presence of open boxes of drugs or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that precise poison.
This insect group is formally called 'wants' by entomologists.
This term stems from a centuries-old similarity with bedbugs, which are insects that can very well parasite humans.
Both red predators and bedbugs are nest-bound, they have adapted to live in their host’s nest or home.
In the U.S., there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disorder in both younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spine and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may choose to give up their baby for adoption.
In adopting, the parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Discovering how the world works using the scientific method is the main goal of science. This method is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just experiments; a trial is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to question and to make observations, as a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle’s views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less because the knowledge of Greek diminished.
In physiological and behavioral observations of rhythms, there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that cycle for a certain period of time, even if no external signals are emitted for this.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main clues that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were carried out: in one experiment the DNA in the phage was marked with a radioactive phosphorus and in the other experiment the protein of the phage was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are hereditary. Other mutations can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who like to visit nature reserves because they want to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
On site you can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people go from small villages by car to their workplace and pass people whose workplace is located in the village where they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow in touch with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that because of this huge carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in a stable state, allowing human evolution to take place over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, water quality problems or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do so many complaints arise in transport systems, why does it go wrong every day? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow looks at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to examine the traffic flow, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave reasonably predictably, which means that traffic flows have a degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this in mathematics.
Correlations have been made between the three core characteristics to better reflect traffic handling: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
With the help of these relationships, the planning, design and operation of road construction facilities is facilitated.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their ability to fly, they could more easily escape enemies and find more efficient food and mating partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
Currently, only dragonflies and mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed just the opposite; that the solar system was moving around the Earth, and the Sun also (and other stars).
This sounds pretty logical, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world’s largest and second longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
At least 20% of all water that flows into the sea via the rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already over a thousand years old.
There are about 800 inhabitants in Vatican City, the smallest independent country in the world and also the country with the lowest population.
Italian is the language of official communication and laws of the Vatican City.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Anyone who lives in the Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is fairly easy to mine them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he has also theorized that they transition into new substances to form into what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you probably know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium fall under the metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys can also contain a small amount of non-metal elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that there are a trillion atoms in the tip at the end of this sentence.
That’s why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, the pen has been reduced in status as new writing methods have emerged and is much less used.
Today, people write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a sharpener.
You may be wondering what will happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes on the market.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that it takes energy to compose a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when the core is split up again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means they fall apart at the least or least.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateaus.
There may be more mares on the side, because the crust there is thinner. Lava could come to the surface more easily.
Content theories are aimed at finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
With these theories, they want to explore the reasons why certain people want to have certain things and what environmental factors influence them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the need pyramid of Maslow and Hertzberg’s motivation-hygiene theory.
In general, there are two ways of acting when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. In one way, they try to act as an equal.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, to conduct evaluation discussions, to delegate and to address people on their responsibility.
On the other side of the spectrum, it transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she gets the feeling of having to change everything the team has done so far, and wants to make everything its own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often this behavior leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first point of contact for their direct physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members. This is because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp. 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to whom each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity come to light when all available resources are effectively deployed within the functional departments of an organization.
The result is that the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order to enable innovation in an organization, management must foster a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organizations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This allows the research area to be reduced and more accurate data can be collected.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injuries, traumas, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental ability.
As there are more and more new technologies, we learn more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models with which we gain more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI immediately reminds most people of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Developing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior is covered by research into AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, this system of artificial intelligence is widely used in the economic, medical, technical and military fields, as in various software applications for PCs and video games.
Many excursions are planned for each class. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible. This allows students from the classroom to view the artifacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned every year and whose earlier versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still bad at first, but they change quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve writing and thus avoid criticism.
Blogging also ‘forces students to learn more about the world around them’. The need to keep the audience interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond traditional school day.
With proper use, blogs can "help students develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in discussions on the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Canada’s bilingual capital is charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and the future.
Further south you will find the Niagara Falls. In the north you will find the beautiful unspoilt Muskoka and more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario typical Canadian in the eyes of outsiders.
Further north, large areas are rather sparsely populated and some of these areas are even virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in terms of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are made up of independent countries or are connected to France and they are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also took the Islamic faith with them, after which it spread widely on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonization in the 15th century.
The region borders the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west and the Sahel region to the north.
Women: female travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether that is true or not.
It also helps to do rings (not too expensive-looking rings).
Women should bear in mind that cultural differences can lead to behaviors that they see as intimidating and that it is common to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don’t be afraid to stand your male (cultural differences don’t speak this right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. The city was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755, they left the city again.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and named it Daru l-Bayad. The Spanish merchants who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around ancient Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan items, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other goods, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The city is located near Rwanda, in the far east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano spawning lava and most of the streets of the city, and especially the city center, were dug.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma, you should check the state of affairs regarding the battles that are going on in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city forms the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the cheapest trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motor taxi) you can move on Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short drive.
Timboektoe is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore used today as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a depleted city, although the city’s reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to desert storms, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, as it has a more Arabic appearance than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs to the east along the border with Mozambique, to the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park is 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild species are kept.
As a major attraction in South Africa, this park is the parade-horse of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, daily maintenance fees and access fees apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card, which offers or access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The entire territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong and is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings that make up Hong Kong’s skyline has already been compared to a glittering bar chart that becomes visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon across the street.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very close together on extracted land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers have settled, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, you can start here well.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and extend from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Indian and Bengali inland.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List, and the area within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps – they also feature some of the last powerful jungle pieces that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is peatland and swampland.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and the area is now home to an estimated 400 Bengali tigers and about 30,000 axle deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (opposite the river). Most depart between 6.30 and 7.30, especially towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is advisable to buy a ticket a few days before, because the regional buses are often fully booked.
In most neighborhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses run that are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis you can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock Bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French-Guyanese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passages with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge is the passage height 15 meters. In August 2011 the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, and the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready for use.
The Guarani were the most prominent indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in self-sufficient agriculture.
In the province of Chaco lived other indigenous tribes, including the Guaycuri and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing and collecting.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of India", originated in the 16th century when Spanish settlers encountered the indigenous people.
There followed a three-century colonization period among the Spanish.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has retained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cacitas.
There are also smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
Check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information on tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP). Its value is approximately one British Pound (GBP).
On the islands there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the shop FIC West. Here you can redeem money.
In general, British pounds are accepted all over the islands and in Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
On the remote islands you probably cannot pay with a credit card, but probably with the British and American currencies. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Exchange your money again before you leave the islands, because Falkland currencies are very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it’s summer there, it’s winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are safe.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature almost never goes below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
Rain levels remain roughly the same throughout the year, with no recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are ultimately just wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
In the park, keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Monkeys, bison, reindeer, bears and almost all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they may seem.
Every year dozens of visitors get hurt because they don’t keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid wearing or cooking scented food and keep the campsite clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded around the year 1850 and is the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the Mau movement's struggle for independence, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, was killed at a non-violent meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, mainly because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely and most have pohutukawa trees that provide shade.
At Waitemata's port, in the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you'll find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes busy and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to find, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can simply be drunk safely, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don’t trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are year-round trips to the reef and injuries following these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, ask for expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Kubuskwalls occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town of 1770. Sometimes they also occur outside this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack people. Most of the sharks are afraid of people and would just swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Pre-booking provides peace of mind to the traveler, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other forms of accommodation, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think more about the offer or if you need to purchase documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so through the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of attendees at music festivals choose to camp on site and most visitors consider this to be an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should be early to get a campsite near the music.
And remember the following: even when the music on the main stages has ended, music may be played on other parts of the festival grounds until late.
For families whose children are still young, there are special camping areas at some festivals.
Pay close attention to where your cabin is when you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the trip through the ice makes a huge noise. if you are too close.
Cruises to St Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers of the cruise are exempt from the visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos are usually committed to getting the most out of the time and money that guests spend. Windows and clocks are usually not present and the exit is sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have special offers in the area of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic beverages, but when people are drunk, it affects their judgment and all seasoned gamblers know that it’s hugely important to stay sober.
If you go up high in the mountains or ride on mountain passes, you should keep in mind that there can be snow or ice and the temperature can be incredibly low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives differently than asphalt.
During snowstorms, there may be enough snow to get stuck in a very short period of time.
Also, the visibility can be hampered by falling or blowing snow or because there is condensation or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic.
The biggest tourist attractions in Africa are safaris, which are the highlight of their journey for many visitors.
The concept of safari refers in popular use to travel over land to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often get close to cars and a standard equipment allows for a good view.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you'll need a binoculars, otherwise you'll have little chance of seeing them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'walking safari') means walking for several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some parts will be played at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympics have been held twice, the first time was in 1964.
If you have booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for events are expected to cost between €2,500 and €130,000. Normal tickets will cost around €7,000.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow these things even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer, if available.
Make sure the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause the fabric to shrink or, in extreme cases, to scorch).
You can purify water in a variety of ways. Some ways are effective to counteract specific risks.
In some areas, it is enough to boil water for a minute, in other areas, water should be boiled for a few minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt, you can drink the best water from a sealed bottle from a reliable company.
Passengers may have to deal with pests that are not present in their own country.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Normally, infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods at certain locations that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers who go to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a significant amount of money when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected via the Buffalo to Pittsburgh highway, you often drive through deserted rear terrain and that makes this route one big challenge.
Are you not used to driving on country roads? Keep your head there. You will encounter a lot of steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp turns.
The set maximum speeds are remarkably lower than in previous and consecutive areas – usually around 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and it’s even more important to stick to them here than otherwise.
Surprisingly, you have much more reach here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry tastes great and in Bavaria the cake is quite rich and varied, just like the cake of its southern neighbor, Austria.
You can see a lot of fruit pastries. All year round the pastries contain apples, and in the summer months also cherry and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste great with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a few small but powerful pastries, try some that are called in the Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen region.
To make a curry you need spicy and spicy ingredients, in combination with vegetables or meat.
Depending on the amount of liquid, a curry can be ‘dry’ or ‘wet’.
In the interior of northern India and also of Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
Indonesian cuisine includes dishes from 17,000 islands and is an overarching concept for a variety of regional cuisines from around the country.
But without additional information, the term refers to the food originally coming from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is now available throughout the archipelago and offers several simple spicy dishes. The most common Javanese flavors are nuts, peppers, sugar (mainly Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant herbs.
Rise brackets support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also cause safety problems because the feet of a rider can get stuck in it.
If a rider of a horse is thrown off but is stuck with his foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged along with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders first wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
Some saddles, and especially English saddles, have safety brackets. This can release a bow leather from the saddle if it is pulled back because a rider falls off the horse.
Cochamó Valley - This is the most popular climbing destination in Chile. This is known as the Yosemite of South America, and has many different large granite walls and rocks.
Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes on the rock faces that seem to have endless potential.
Winter sports where you descend, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular. You slide down on a snow-covered descent with skis or a snowboard at your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many lovers, who are sometimes called 'ski bums', who plan whole holidays around skiing in a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The beginning of skiing dates back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also known as off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not quite the same, but it looks like alpine skiing or mountaineering, which is done a lot on steep terrain. You'll need a lot of stugger skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a walking route.
In good conditions you can travel longer distances than walking, but it rarely happens that you reach the speed of cross-country skiing on landscaped slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travelers between different countries have to apply for a visa several times and undergo passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions almost as a single country in this area.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo a passport check again.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition indicating which items produced are antiques. Some tax offices give goods that are over 100 years old the definition antiques.
The definition may vary by location. In North America, for example, the age limit is lower than in Europe.
It is possible to classify handcrafted products as antiques, despite being newer than comparable mass products.
Among the Sámi, keeping reindeer is an important form of livelihood, and the culture surrounding trade is also very important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer farming. They engaged in fishing, hunting and such matters. Reindeer were usually used as migratory animals.
Many Sámi work in modern professions today. In Sápmi, the Sámi area tourism is an important source of income.
The word 'gypsy' is mainly used by non-Roma. However, it is also often considered offensive because of the associations with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Roma.
If travel advice applies to the country where you want to go, it can affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
In addition to the advice of your own government, you can also consult the advice of other governments. However, their advice is aimed at their own residents.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Opinions contain only a brief summary of the political situation in a single country.
They often provide a volatile, general and extremely simplistic picture compared to other, more detailed sources.
Emergency weather is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can lead to damage, serious social disruption or the loss of lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary based on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Symptoms and consequences of heavy weather include strong winds, hail, large amounts of rainfall and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterfalls and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms are among other examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks associated with severe weather conditions in their surroundings, as these may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wants to visit a country that is considered a war zone should be trained professionally.
A search for “course in hostile environments” on the Internet probably yields the address of a local company.
In a course, all issues outlined here are usually dealt with in more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role-playing games, a lot of first aid and occasional weapon training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness, but there are few publications about war zones.
Travellers who have planned a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the correct documentation for the return trip.
It varies considerably whether governments want to provide passports that do not mention gender (X), or to update a name or gender on documents.
There is just as much difference in the goodwill of foreign governments to recognize these documents.
In addition, security checks have been much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they do not come through this scan with undamaged privacy and dignity.
Mui currents are the recurring stream of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow on the beach.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is located in a few deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most of the deaths are caused by fatigue by trying to swim against the current. This could just be impossible.
When you've escaped the strong current, re-swimming is so whipped.
Try to focus on a place where you will not be caught again. Depending on your skills and whether you have been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a less big “wedding trip” feeling), it takes longer, and it can be more intense.
Travelers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes have difficulty adapting to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the customs of your own culture.
In the past, when you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travelers had to adapt in a new country.
Usually, patience and understanding are not expected for travellers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in silence before the show starts.
Often the sound of sellers and tourists is always audible here. The story of the light and sound is similar to that of a book.
The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projections on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are highlighted.
The Southern Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries. They have the most bases, with sixteen operating in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is the King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the crowded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, near the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula pass into the plateau, then they emerge again to form the 360 km long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is traversed by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain at 4892 meters.
A satellite phone can be your only option in remote locations where there is no reception for mobile phone.
A satellite phone is not really a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, and for expeditions where there is a need for external data and communication.
Your local phone provider can give you more information on how to connect to this service.
It is becoming more and more popular for people who are planning an interim year to travel and learn.
Especially school leavers use this to take an interim year before the university without adverse consequences for their education.
Often, enrolling for a training abroad during an interim year can increase your chances of returning to higher education in your own country.
Normally, enrollment for these educational programs requires tuition.
Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing. The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the island groups off the coast.
A hunt is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for every yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland, so many people sail in their free time that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
For example, you can spend a few full days in the historic place and spend the night on the ship.
Since 2009, you do not need a separate visa if you only land during a boat trip.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It’s not something to be ashamed of: it’s no different from many fears other people have as well.
Knowing how airplanes work can help to remove a fear that comes from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
Courier companies receive a generous fee to deliver items quickly. For business documents, merchandise or spare parts for a necessary repair, time often plays a very important role.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they ship things by air, on some routes it can take days before they are unloaded and come through customs.
Only if checked baggage could be processed faster. According to the rules of airlines, there must be a corresponding passenger and that is you.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is to have a bag of money down for this privilege (or even better, let your employer do it).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
There is usually no point in looking for discounts on business class or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know all too well that there is a group of pilots who are willing to count down a lot of money to fly somewhere quickly and comfortably and the airlines charge matching costs.
Chisinau is the Moldovan capital. Here the Romanian language is mainly spoken, but the Russian language is also common.
As a multi-ethnic republic, Moldova was subjected to an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by the members of the UN.
Economic ties have re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the political negotiations having failed.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the largest port next to Istanbul and a good traffic hub.
The once ancient city of Izmir is now a modern, developed and busy commercial center on a bay and is surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, the glass buildings and the modern shopping centers covered with red tiles, the 18th-century markets, the ancient mosques and churches, yet the city feels more like a Mediterranean, European city than traditional Turkish.
In the village of Haldarsvak you can enjoy views of the nearby island of Eysturoy, as well as a special church with eight corners.
On a number of graves near the church are fascinating marble pigeon sculptures.

Regular announcements in the metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are made by an automated system in several languages, including French, Arabic, Spanish, English and also in Japanese.
The inhabitants of Paris are known as selfish, rude and arrogant.
While this is usually just an incorrect stereotype, it can’t hurt to put your best foot forward in Paris and behave like someone who’s ‘been élevé’ (well-educated). This will make it a lot easier to explore Paris.
The hard exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded and this wooded area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
There are particularly many different plant communities, due to the different microclimates, the different soil types and the varying height differences.
This area is also the habitat of a very wide range of animal and bird species.
There are rare animals such as the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wild cat and the eagle, in addition to all kinds of more common species.
When women visit a monastery, they are required to wear a skirt over the knees and their shoulders must be covered.
Usually you get a wrapping cloth as a woman when you arrive unprepared at a monastery, but if you bring your own copy, with nice screaming colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you kindly.
On the other hand, men should wear pants to a minimum over the knees.
You can also borrow them from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed every time, so you may not feel comfortable with it. One size fits all for men!
Like many other Mediterranean regions, the Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and olive oil is widely used.
A simple and popular dish for dinner, mainly during the summer months, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and whatever is available to flavorers, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
Self-contained nouns, just like you, always have a capital at the beginning, even if they are in the middle of the sentence.
This way you make a first name difference between a number of verbs and objects.
Nevertheless, writing is more complicated, because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective should be used as a noun.
Most Italian words are written exactly as they are pronounced, so the pronunciation is generally not a problem.
You have to pay the most attention to the c and the g. The pronunciation of this depends on the vowel that follows.
You also have to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means sweetheart, while carro means carriage.

But people who speak a little bit of Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese looks so much like this that you don’t have to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete, and serve as museums or educational sites.
Light pollution was not as big a problem at the time as it is today, so they were often built in cities or on campuses, more accessible than they are today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is the sight of cherry blossoms and this has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favorite flowers and that’s where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom festivals of Japan were organized by the emperor and were intended only for himself and other aristocrats in the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so you need to suppress the tendency to remove even “only one” species.
When you collect samples during a visit to a landscaped garden, you are immediately and without discussion denied access to the garden.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to stay, very easy to navigate and virtually everything is available after arrival.
But if you are in the 'high tropics', but a few degrees on the north side of the equator, you will experience both heat (always) and powerful sun (when the sky is clear, this is less common).
There are also some buses to the north to Hebron, the cemetery of the biblical patriarchs Isaac, Jacob, Abraham and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you take really enters Hebron and not only drives to the nearby Jewish settlement Kiryat Arba.

For example, you can visit castles in the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, book a cruise to the interesting cities along the Danube or take a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also indicate popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Moreover, people who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have adopted many traditions that are part of the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up the whole Easter night until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may just as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, Easter vigils are often held on the Saturday evening of the Easter weekend. Here, the congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to its long distance from the continent, it was not possible for mammals to make the trip, making the giant turtle the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since man set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter, the Arctic and Antarctica take place at polar night, which means that the sun does not actually rise.
There is a good chance that you can see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less dark day and night.
The areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not often a problem. That means that you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working environment is more structured and formal in nature than in the Western world.
Packs are standard work clothes and colleagues call each other by the last name or job name.
