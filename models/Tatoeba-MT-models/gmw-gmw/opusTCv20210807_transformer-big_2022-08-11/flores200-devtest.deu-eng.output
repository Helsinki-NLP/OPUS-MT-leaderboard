This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils in general cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feather of this animal was chestnut brown on the top and light or carotenoid on the bottom.
The finding also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft called rakis, but have different features of feathers – barbules and barbules – the researchers concluded that the rakis was presumably a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or heartbeat. The researchers suspected that the sample, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult and not the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not chickauns.
A car bomb exploded on the morning of yesterday at the Gaziantep Police Bureau, killing two police officers and wounding over twenty more people.
According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
Police said they suspected a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) behind the attack.
They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation and nothing else.
In order to determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma current, the luminosity and the rotation are included together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversals of the magnetic field.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts attraction forces on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter acts on other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter is in a kind of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said the new variant was “extremely troubling and alarming due to the very high mortality rate.”
Some patients may have contracted the pathogen in the hospital, Dr. Moll says, and at least two were medical hospital employees.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to be low; 6,000 of the total of 330,000 people infected in South Africa at some point in time.

In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cabin and put a preprinted sheet of paper on which the candidate of their choice is registered in an envelope.
After officials confirm the identity of the voters, the voters throw the envelope into the ballot box and sign the electoral list.
The French electoral law stipulates the procedure quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there are no envelopes at the start of the election and that no envelopes are thrown, except those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each part of the process as witnesses, and in the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

The names of the defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police President Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants had appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car snapped in, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to the head.
The road on which the accident occurred was temporarily blocked, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
As a result, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
In the meantime, Adekoya was charged with murdering her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff’s Court.
She is in custody until the indictment and trial, but testimony from eyewitnesses may be distorted, as her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: “Journalists seem to cross a dangerous boundary when they post photos of suspects, etc.”
The Crown Office, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a reset of the borders to the state before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics allegedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley of ten years from the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority wants to accept such a presence only for five years.
The shooters of the accompanying pest control trial should be closely supervised by rangers, as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O’Flynn, the executive director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four gunners selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training lessons.
Martelly has sworn in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly’s response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the partly violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating have been reported in defective iPods, triggering six fires and four people suffering from mild burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economic Affairs, Commerce and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents of overheating, which the company described as “not serious.”
The ministry responded by describing Apple’s postponement of the report as “really regrettable.”
The earthquake shook Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Civil Protection Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no evidence of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by kidnapping their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and there have been at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an older lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in the footsteps of his father and took a medical career.
He trained as a maternity doctor and began his work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began examining premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of a hormone accelerated the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two “black box” aircraft pens.
Ringer colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
"Tommy Dreamer said, ""Luna was the first Queen of the Extremes. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."""
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented: “Luna was just as crazy as I was ... maybe even more crazy ... I love her and will miss her ... hopefully she’s in a better place.”
Of the 1,400 people interviewed before the federal elections in 2010, the proportion of those who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Temporary Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent said that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympics was to swim in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle disciplines at the Commonwealth Games, as well as in three layered squadrons, but his fitness was questioned because of his many complaints.
He was unable to take the medicines needed to overcome his pain, as they are prohibited at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software at the beginning of February and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water supply to Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with Earth long ago, scientists promise insights into how planets, especially the Earth, are formed.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as “political gossip and silliness.”
It is speculated that he could apply for the office of president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transport and the above-ground trains will not stop in Wembley. There are no parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities available on site.
With the concern for the lack of transport options, the chances of the game being played behind closed doors without the fans of the team increased.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved within just two generations, although it had previously been assumed that this process took much longer due to the mating between a native Darwin finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into a variety of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be turned and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images, called picture manuscripts, in books called picture manuscripts.
This is called the PH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes its color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemicals tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons to which their electrons have been withdrawn (because hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then mold them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet in almost every house, which was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths that visited men and women in mixed society.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, then use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was transported to space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the atmosphere distorts our light and our gaze.
It takes a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet to shoot a satellite or telescope into space.
The bike has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest service the bike has given us is much easier and faster transport.
It has brought us the railway, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized cats that eat prey of medium-sized animals, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-distance domestic cats) who eat far smaller prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of her success is the concept of the niche, a special task that every cat has and which ensures that she does not compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called packs.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and boys.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion packs act similar to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble the lion (but not other large cats) in behavior and are equally deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly good), swim, jump long distances and pull with the five-fold strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger does not sound like the full-bodied roar of the lion, but rather like a set of grumpy screaming words.
Ozelots eat small animals. If they can, they capture monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of the animals that the Ozelot hunts are much smaller than himself.
Scientists think that ozelotes track and track animals to eat (prey) with their sense of smell. They sniff after where they have been on the ground.
Ozelots hunt their prey by visually aligning with their surroundings and then plunging onto their prey.
When a small group of creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, when they move across a mountain range or a river, or when they relocate to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all. It still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Specification is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that humans inhale, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans emit (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food through the sun through photosynthesis. They also donate shadows.
We build our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. We feed mainly on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of his time, so he feared nothing but other Mosasaurus.
His long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set on the palate, which meant that there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but he might have had a forked tongue, he ate turtles, big fish, other mosses, and maybe even a cannibal.
He also attacked everything that came into the water; not even a great dinosaur like the T. Rex was capable of it.
While most of their food may be known to us, the Romans had their share in strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a kind of rodent called seven-sleepers.
Another difference was that the poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, while the rich men preferred to have joint banquets where they lay on the side while eating their meals.
Dishes of ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had neither corn nor tomatoes nor potatoes nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman has ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of God.
They offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried by ceremonies and festivals to conform to the will of the gods.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner altar room, which could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zigkurats, were erected as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, homes were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women cooked in the yard. Shops simply consisted of shop counters open to the street. Stone was used for house construction.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Old Norse legends, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder. As he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although all countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie The Legacy of the Knights Templar, you might think a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated to 4 July 1776" written. The text is located upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 293 x 241 x 2 inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of his life.
It is therefore possible that the note was simply added as a marking.
The landing on D-Day and subsequent battles freed the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"He was ruled by the "Vichy" Frenchmen, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the conquerors instead of fighting them."
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
After just two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significant group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which somehow defines the size of a society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture implies the transfer of knowledge over several generations, a sustained cultural footprint and adequate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical testimonies and failing to be recognized as outright civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the federal treaty, which consisted only of Congress.
Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the federal authorities to enforce all its laws, which often failed to cooperate.
He also had no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was FIFA world champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, waterball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions and Italians take part in international competitions and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is geographically often referred to as "Archipel".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passed by and documented the name of the island as Ilha Formosa or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the indigenous cereal cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty Armed Forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan the province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, the Qing dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki after the defeat in the First Chinese-Japanese War (1894-1895), in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists mainly of three buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored until 1976, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the world’s most widely used still image format is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still being produced today, but more importantly, its image format has been adopted by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format measures confusingly 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-dishonored and often ridiculed third rule is a simple guideline that creates momentum while maintaining a level of order in an image.
It states that the crossing point of the lines, which thirds an image vertically and horizontally, is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, was under test.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together in spite of different languages and customs.
His omnipotence dominated everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the churches are available precisely for this reason.
The central power of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years. This concentration of power and money caused many to doubt whether this principle was met.
Soon after the outbreak of fighting, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective as it cut the country off from vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which posed a danger even for neutral ships.
As the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolation were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to become a member of the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the U.S. with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of displaying different ages. Each period of time in China and every family in power was a dynasty of its own.
Between the individual dynasties there were also inconsistent periods of divided provinces, the most well-known of which was the period of the Three Kingdoms, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those days, fierce wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The time of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest epochs in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the battle for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a turning away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a ruler alone.
Even after the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and best could resign.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class membership, the army rankings were now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond this everyday life. He often visited a cave known as “Hira” on the mountain of “Only” (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived time and provides a vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual tendencies.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above it and the numerous surrounding mountains. Very little can be seen or heard from this world from the inside of the cave.
The Cheops pyramid is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.
Built in the third century BC by the Egyptians, the Cheops pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to venerate deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Gizeh Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead includes several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, as well as the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Cheops’ wives and family members.
The “slash” symbol looks like a V and the “slash” symbol looks like a bracket or square where the bottom line is missing.
Upstairs means that you should start at the top and push the bow. Downstairs means that you start at the frog (that’s where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Painting usually generates a softer sound, while painting is more powerful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, keep in mind that the printed sheet markings are there for musical reasons, which is why they should normally be respected.
The panicking King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, her two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Therese and the 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and the sister of the king, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris on 6 October 1789 in Versailles by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people threatening the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of their carriages.
At some point, a member of the upset crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the eyes of the appalled queen.
The war expenditures of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Philippine people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover most of the expenses, and interest from bonds flowed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits that came from the ongoing exploitation of the Philippine people represented the fundamental gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The epoch in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended consistently around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that embraces a broad spectrum of ideas in practice, from technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has "impacts" on societies that are inherent rather than social.
One can say, for example, that the passenger car inevitably entails the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network for only a small number of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The widespread automobile ownership also leads to a higher number of road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new health care techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element that was drawn from writers such as Goethe, Spruce and Schlegel.
In the context of romance, it is geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures related to this geography emerged and these, because they were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily octroyed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today’s world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicentre of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined over the course of the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
At that time, the title of fashion capital of the world also migrated from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West are 25 to 30 years behind due to the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to fix clothes.
Demand economy is agriculture that aims to produce just so much food that it meets the needs of the farmer or the farmer and his/her family.
The subsistence economy is a simple, often organic type of cultivation that uses stored seeds native to the eco-region and combines them with alternating field farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers operated a subsistence economy, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in age, ethnicity, class, place and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
The members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashion, habits and jargon.
One of the most common methods of illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have not been socialized by adults due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood.
"Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children were held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations."
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before being exposed or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When raised entirely by animals, the wild child displays behaviors (within his physical capabilities) that are almost completely consistent with those of his specific nursing animal, such as his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that assists individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using a new computer program or when starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the small office clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistance is built into the software and is intended to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to handle alone.
Children are housed in foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the system of care accommodation is a piece of safety for these children.
Our care family system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The nursing home should cover all the needs they had not received in the home from which they were previously taken out.
The Internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of the benefit and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects of Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses on websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for the interpretation of microexpressions, a few milliseconds of facial movements.
In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President’s Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out how people who can no longer understand language because of brain damage can still properly assess people’s honesty.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like the human to meet its need for amino acid from available plant sources.
In addition, it has serious consequences if you fail to do so: growth depression, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide large amounts of proteins, all of which contain essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in the same way as the chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of targeted waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep for a short time (10-60 minutes) later.
This can easily be achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you are someone who introduces the alarm clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you are forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another possibility based on the biorhythm is to drink a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known for its diuretic effect) before bedtime, so you are forced to get up for urination.
The degree of inner peace that a person possesses correlates in reverse with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can gain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been extended to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened by yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are opened and the enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, resulting in cooperation between the USSR and the US. After the war, the clash of systems, the course and the culture led to the countries becoming hostile.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and in reality will be carried out by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence had already collapsed completely and the only hope was a retreat and a reconstruction along the Romanian bridge head.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them after they invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to bring workforce and material across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly by submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain just like the rest of Europe.
Goats were domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zigros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as farm animals in order to easily get to their milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on hills or other pastures. Goats were cared for by goats, much like the more well-known sheep herds; often they were children or adolescents. These pasture methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century, conveyor tracks were built in England.
Although the conveyor tracks consisted only of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and to pull greater loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Dredges were introduced quite early to secure the position of the rails, but gradually the realization prevailed that rails that carry an iron band are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first fully iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of movement was walking. Two million years ago, humans began to walk upright with the advent of Homo Erectus (meaning “Righteous Man”).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not go up so regularly.
Two-footed species can be found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering a little.
In many cases, this is just a symptomatic treatment, but if you don’t just want temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity and that the problems have become more serious due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of humans.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap wide pages that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that still exist. The original manuscript has not survived the times.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs who have survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But many things about birds still look like a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits to use the computer jargon.
The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so common that you cannot make a diagnosis immediately.
The best sign of poisoning from swallowing can be the presence of an open container containing medications or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "craze" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs. These are insects that are very adaptable to parasitizing people.
Both predators and bed bugs are nidicol, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or the housing of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS than men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their baby.
In adopting, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over parenting.
The main objective of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific research.
However, it is not just experimentation, where an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses. The scientific research is also guided by asking questions and carrying out observations.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all matters of science, including psychology, were recognized.
With the loss of Greek language, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely based on the presence of the body's own cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Behaviors specific to a cycle, which are not only reactions to signs of external cycles, are known to most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, which even in the absence of external signals perform free-swinging cycles for a time.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to incorporate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they either marked the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation involved, the significance of the relevant piece of genetic material, and whether the cells concerned are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to drive to their workplace and are passed by others whose job is in the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, all are connected in some way to a transportation system based on the private car, and support it.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in the company and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems lead to such abuses, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between the two.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult, as you cannot predict driver behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave fairly consistently; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically coarsely.
To better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find more efficient food and sexual partners.
Most insects can fold back their wings along their body.
As a result, they have a wider selection of small hatches in which they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and one-day flies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), was moving around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, since it doesn’t seem like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and wateriest river in the world, running more than eight times as much as water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes up to six miles wide.
As much as 20% of the water that flows into the oceans via the planet’s rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main stream is 6387 km (3980 miles) long, absorbing water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, who were then more than a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants, it is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to humans since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in their original form and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also put forward the theory that they transform into new substances in order to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
The universe consists in its entirety of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the point at the end of this sentence.
As a result, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has fallen into the background with the advent of newer writing methods, so it has been pushed back into its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to get close to a sharpener.
You can be curious about what will become of the keyboard if something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy wagon up a hill, and when the core is split again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they disintegrate even with little or no impetus.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearby side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the mares and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side there could be more Maria, as the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to ascend to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow up.
These theories deal with what causes certain people to want exactly the things they do, and what influences in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow’s theory of demand hierarchy and Hertzberg’s two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. The one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary measures, performing performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and putting employees into duty.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything different from what the team has done and takes everything into its own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the team’s success and failure.
This behavior often leads to divisions between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones that may not be taken into account by the local leadership.
The presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
"The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.x"
Why would an organization take up the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organization? One goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative method of responding to the customer need.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more powerful.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence of a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus limiting the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumors, affect behavior and cause changes in some brain functions.
New technologies allow us to see and explore certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
While AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in AI involves manufacturing machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, the preparation of strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become independent disciplines focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
Today, the AI system is widely used in the business, medical, engineering and military sectors and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. Not infrequently, a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Virtual excursions are a technical solution. Students can view museum pieces from the classroom, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state’s capital city. The website is rebuilt every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a collection album.
While students often have a sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blog experience, that usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging “forces students to learn more about the world around them” and the need to attract the public inspires students to write smartly and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs “can enable students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other people’s texts and explain their own perspectives on specific topics” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s enchanting, bilingual capital and is characterized by a number of art galleries and museums presenting Canada’s past and present.
Further to the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north the untouched beauty of nature is spreading in Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more characterize Ontario as what is considered typical Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas farther north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the US than Canada has citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (only one that looks too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider assault, and that it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay consistent when you reject men, and don’t be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences back or forth; that doesn’t mean it’s all right!)
Today's Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called the Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to give it up after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it’s easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole spectrum of tinnef are sold, but that’s all just for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any stay outside Gomas should be carefully planned to learn the state of the fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorbike taxis) to get around in Goma, as the usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short drive.x
This combined with its relative inaccessibility has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction for its reputation and has an airport, it is nowadays a impoverished city.
In 1990, due to the threat of desert sand, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites.
It was one of the most important stations of Louis Gate's PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country’s cities because it has an Arab rather than an African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entrance fees.
It can also be worth buying a wild card that allows access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name given to the territory of Hong Kong and is the focal point for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline have been compared to a dazzling bar chart visible through the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island’s urban development is crowded on newly gained land along the north coast.
If you are looking for traces of the colonial past of the area, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world and stretch over 80 km from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also include some of the last remaining stocks of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengali royalty and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart throughout the day from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses departing between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang.
Since buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are driven by small Japanese coaster buses that are cozy and stable.x
Collective taxis provide a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 meters high, its length is 378 meters and it has two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The passage height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction work was completed in August 2011, but the release for traffic took place only in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to start operations in September 2017 and the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group that inhabited what is now East Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunters, who also operated subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of native tribes, such as the Guaycuri and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, collecting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Greater Province of West India, originated in the 16th century as a result of the convergence of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for its polo team and players being among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December on the Polofields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed here at other times of the year.x
Information on competitions and points of sale for polo tickets can be found at Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is determined in accordance with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the island, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British Pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and on Stanley credit cards.
On the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and US currency can be accepted; check with the owners in advance which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no pronounced rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority, visitors should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bisons, wapitis, elk, bears and virtually all large animals can work, it can happen that they move on to the attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them enough space.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking high-scented foods and make sure to keep them clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of an infamous naval pat in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the harbour.
All ships except a British cruiser were sunk. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the chieftain Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland stretches over two ports, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities and most offer shade donated by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful shopping promenade along the coast.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better tolerated.
You can drink the local tap water without hesitation, but if you are worried, you will also find bottled water without any problems.
"For Australians, the idea of coffee is "Flat White". A small black is "Espresso", cappuccino is filled high with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk."
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, pay attention to all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur near the beach and near estuaries from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also occur outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he has a place to stay after arriving at the destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as tent pitches, through a travel agency.x
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even a combination of flight and hotel.
You can also withhold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most view this as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to go early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that parts of the festival still play music until late at night, even if the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as breaking through ice will cause quite awful noise for those most affected.
The cruises to Saint Petersburg also offer time for a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to keep guests on site for as long as possible and to spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a mood and make sure they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge, but drunkenness affects judgment, and all good players realize the importance of staying sober.
If you want to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes, you should expect snow, ice and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads the adhesion is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In case of snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility can also be affected by falling or roaming snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.x
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues for the most part uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari refers to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach close to cars, and the standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are often shy and you can watch them better with a binoculars.
A foot safari (also called “bush walk,” “hiking safari” or “footing”) consists of a hike that takes either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games after it was hosted as early as 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for the year 2020 before the postponement was announced, you could find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus did not apply until July 2020, for which the Olympics were scheduled.
It is estimated that most tickets for the event will cost between €2,500 and €130,000, an average ticket about €7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help with drying. Many hotels lend irons and ironing boards, even if you are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or you don’t want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric does not get too hot (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which prove to be more effective in counteracting certain hazards.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it must be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, then you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they do not know from their home regions.
Pests can destroy foods, cause irritation or, at worst, even trigger allergic reactions, administer poison or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force are not usually classified as pests.
Customs-free shopping is the ability to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers whose destination country has a high taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is arguably the biggest driving challenge, as it often leads through remote, untapped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, stay mindful: steep slopes, narrow roadways and sharp curves prevail here.
The specified speed limits are noticeably lower than in the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than usual.
But interestingly, mobile coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite tasty. In Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as is the case with the southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit pastries are widely used, with apples being cooked as pastries throughout the year and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also include almonds, hazelnuts or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich baked goods, then try what is called Berliner, pancake or crab, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either “dry” or “moist” depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland North India and Pakistan yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a choice of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further attributes, it usually denotes the food originally originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes, as the Javanese prefer peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut blossom sugar) and a range of aromatic spices.
Stirrups are aids for the feet of the riders hanging down on both sides of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider’s feet may be trapped in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and catches his foot on the stirrup, he can be dragged along as the horse passes through. To keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, in particular English saddles, have safety straps that allow a stirrup strap to fall from the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a crashing rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile’s main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
Climbers from all over the world continue to discover new routes along the walls that offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports such as skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and ride down a slope over a snow-covered subsoil.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "skiers", who plan their entire holiday around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings with depictions of skiers go back to 5000 BC!
The origins of the ski descent as a sport go back at least to the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Skiing with a backpack: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski hiking.
It resembles alpine touring skiing or mountaineering, but does not necessarily include them, as the latter are run in steep terrain and require much firmer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel slightly longer distances than hiking – very rarely you will reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-kept cross-country trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but has many independent countries. Normally you would have to apply for visas several times and go through several passport checks if you want to travel through several countries.
The Schengen area, however, functions a little like a country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to pass through passport control again.
Accordingly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member states individually, which saves time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no general definition of which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be described as 'ancient', although they are younger than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer farming is an important source of Sámi’s livelihood, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
Also in the past, not all Sámi have grown reindeer on a large scale, but have lived on fishing, hunting and the like.
Today, many Sámi work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Although the term "gypsy" is used mainly by non-Roma, it is often seen as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma."
If a travel advice is issued for the country you are going to visit, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments than yours, but their clues are tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Deliberations are just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the collective term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disturbances or the loss of lives.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world and there are different types of it that depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall and forest fires are forms and effects of storms, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, water pants and hurricanes.
Regional and seasonal storms include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly warned to pay attention to any type of severe weather that affects their area, as this can affect all travel plans.
Anyone who plans to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should complete a professional training for it.
"An internet search for ''course on hostile environments'' will probably show the address of a local company."
A course usually covers all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid and sometimes weapon training.
There are numerous books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning a gender-matching operation abroad must ensure that they carry valid ID documents for the return journey.
Governments’ willingness to issue passports of unspecified gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very different.
In addition, searches of security checks have become much more intrusive in the period after 11 September 2001.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact while passing the scanners.
Crack currents are the returning stream of waves broken on the beach, often in reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the reflux concentrates in a few deeper areas and a rapid flow to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue when trying to swim back against the current, which may prove impossible.
When you get out of the flow, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get to where you won’t be caught again; alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you’ve been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to adapt to their culture of origin.
When you come home after a stay abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and abandoned some behaviors of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew travelers would have to adapt in a new country.
You may not expect returning travelers to need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and while it’s still before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the noises of tourists and sellers. The story of the noises and the light is just like a story book.
The Sphinx is used as a background and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, illuminating the various pyramids.
The Southern Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, which is bounded by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula cross into the plateau and then rise again to form the 360-km-long chain of Ellsworth Mountains, divided by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone can be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside and in a clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by ships, including pleasure ships, as well as expeditions that require data and voice remote connections.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to that service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is study and course offerings abroad.
This is particularly popular with school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before the university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in an overseas bridging year program can actually improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
As a rule, a tuition fee is charged for registering for these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The “Land of a Thousand Lakes” also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
For the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national leisure activity in Finland, one in six or eight have a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one to forty.)
Most pure Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg in Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning in the evening and staying on the ship.
If you only go ashore as part of the on-board excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a scary experience for people of all ages and all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience behind them.
You don’t have to be ashamed of this: this is nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and how they operate during a flight can help some overcome the fear of the unknown or the feeling of being in control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of things. Often time is a very important factor in corporate documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on other routes and on smaller companies difficulties arose.
If they shipped items via air freight, the discharge and customs clearance on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get through it faster was to ship it as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines do not allow to ship baggage without a passenger, and that is where you come into play.
The obvious method of flying in first or business class is to add a big chunk of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your own company to take charge of the costs).
However, this is not cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to have to pay up to four times the normal economy rate for the business and the eleventh for the first class!
In general, it makes no sense to search for discounts on direct flights from A to B even for business or first-class seats.
The airlines know very well that there is a certain core group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money and charge appropriate prices for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the founding of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is the Christian Orthodox.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good traffic hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, advanced and bustling business center, located on a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glazed buildings and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red tiled roofs, the 18th century market as well as ancient mosques and churches, although the city exudes an atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe rather than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvak offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On the cemetery there are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some graves.
It is worth strolling through the fascinating village for half an hour.
To the north and in the immediate vicinity is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in bright colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly via Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (place of pilgrimage) in the north – a place world-famous for its Marian appearances.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave as well as a place that has an almost immeasurable significance for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many men and women who have survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked to death, Jews and Gentiles alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence and respect it deserves. Don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don’t mess up the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements are made in the metro exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often only an incorrect cliché, in Paris it is best to show off your best side and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-behaved), which will make it much easier to get along.
The rude appearance of the Parisians disappears very quickly if you show basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, there are mainly beech, spruce and fir trees and it offers a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, different soils and alternating altitudes, it has a remarkably large variety of plant societies.
The area is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
There are rare fauna such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynxes, wild cats and chickens, as well as many more common species.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that extend over their knees and also cover their shoulders.
In most monasteries there are changing skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun will give you a smile at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that extend over their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the inventory at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after every user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any currently available ingredient such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns begin next to the word you for ""you"" always with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence."
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It may also make reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a tune word or property word is used as the main word.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means "love", whereas carro means "carriage".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand formulations.
Of course, if you speak a Romance language, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don’t have to learn it extra.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational venues.
Since light pollution during its peak phase was not the problem it is today, it is usually found in cities or university campuses that are easier to reach than those built in recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where plum blossoms represented the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other nobles around the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove "only one" specimen."
When you visit a formally created garden and collect "samples", you are also thrown out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place where you can find your way around and buy almost anything after your arrival.
Since you are in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you have to expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to travel with goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have also been adopted throughout the world by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open spot to see the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
Traditional churches often hold an Easter Night Watch on Saturday evening, during the Easter weekend, with the celebrations of the churches often starting at midnight, at which the resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or swimming.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to embark on the voyage, making the giant turtle the main pasture in the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans entered the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the Polar Night, which means that the sun does not rise over the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the northern lights as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
The Japanese working culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
Suits are part of the usual business clothing and colleagues address their family names or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the focus being on group performance rather than praise for individual achievements.
Oftentimes, employees have to seek the consent of their superiors for all the decisions they make, and they are expected to follow the instructions of their bosses unconditionally.
