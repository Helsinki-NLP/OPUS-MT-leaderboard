28-year-old chef found dead at San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping center.
The brother of the victim said that he cannot imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "at last it went uphill again."
The corpse found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, San Francisco’s court medical department said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABS station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a chef in Boston, had gotten his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and devastated” by his death.
“We’re a small team that works like a close family and we’re going to miss him painfully,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went uphill for him."
“He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend,” Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of conflict.
He was the brother who swam with the river.
"In everything that goes wrong in the world, he was that rubbish diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the SFPD's call phone at 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn’t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star made this clear in an interview.
"I'm always stuck in drawers or get labeled from the outside, which usually has little to do with me and reality."
“I don’t want to always be perfect and successful.”
"Truly, these things are more sniffing to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of television with loose dutt and Mexican food, the magazine says.
“We women don’t have to be married or have children to be perfect,” the Hollywood star said.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Love is not a child's play" Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will run with us on August 25.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on the horse is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a few colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their workday, they chased home to the feeding troughs in a fast gallop.
A mile at that pace, I was scared.
“It wasn’t a good experience,” Langer says.
And so the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was again close to horses.
He let his family take him over the ALRV plant, he didn’t even jump on a horse for photo purposes.
Longer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid handed the man from Anhausen the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.
There is no shortage of awards for the sympathetic athlete.
Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...
Even the Queen of England has taken it.
Langer is the 18th winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting achievements, but also for social commitment."
For decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. champion was added to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-rider Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumous the handballer Erhard.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Spring Stadium, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept distance from the big animals.
Clinton and Trump's Economic Policy: It's All About the Money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP trade agreement – that’s what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two U.S. presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy, as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
About the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small in doubt and warns of how the state can harm the economy – with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself would be completely different, Trump claims.
He will push back regulations massively, and he is pushing for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates – for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money to do so.
That’s why taxes would be raised for the rich, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
We need to invest in it, Trump and Clinton say.
The Democratic candidate even announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected, for example, by Republicans’ state-critical tea party wing.
So Trump could still have party-internal discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal production in the US.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, expressly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program, calling: “A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs.”
“It will probably be either China, Germany or America – I want us to be.”
But not only with regard to infrastructure, but also with regard to international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement, does not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the United States from international trade – they simply want to better protect American jobs.
They will be better paid, Clinton said.
The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger wage.
He wants to raise it to $15 an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says the minimum wage must be up, then he says he should not be changed.
However, the big discussion in the coming months is likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, Trump wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.
His critics argue that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say more taxes are not the solution.
Escape: 'Every refugee has experience with sexual violence'
Sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby that is no more than a year old.
One of them put her little son in the arm.
He looks in the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the table.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the divisional managing director of Condrobs, a social assistance provider in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the northern part of Munich in one of the few decentralized accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women’s Aid.
It was recently officially opened.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men, not even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard at the door.
"It's not exaggerated to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her run," Bahr said.
“Men are fleeing wars because they are being politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families are sending them to Europe as bearers of hope,” she says.
Among women, other reasons for fleeing out prevail: “Many steal secretly from it because they see no other way out.”
In their homeland, they have experienced sexual violence, forced sex watching, honor killing, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives them away.
On the run it continues.
"For example, the fact that tractors demand sexual activity for a bottle of water is not uncommon," Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Anyone who thinks that the end will come as soon as they arrive in Germany is insane, Bahr says.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters are often considered inferior and abused at worst.
As a result, about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in Munich’s North are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children were not born voluntarily."
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
"Or they don't dare to talk openly about what they've experienced, because shame is too great."
Since they often don’t know how to help themselves, they need more accommodations just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked if they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some respond with no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodations.
Even in Swabia alone, refugee women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesman for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, in some common accommodations there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality also calls for women to be separated from men.
A study published for the committee states: “It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately.”
“If privacy is lacking or if men and women are housed together, violence against women can continue.”
In particular, the washrooms should be separate and easily accessible to women, the study says.
How much women feel about this need for protection can be seen from the urgency that exists on the house in Munich.
"Since we've been talking about being there, we've got a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant Doctors Strike: Demands for New Work Combat Measures
Assistant doctors’ representatives have called on their unions to approve new labour-fighting measures in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The British Medical Association’s Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called for its entire council to approve more work-fighting measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC said ministers had failed to address concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had remained “persistently quiet” on issues, leading to the contract being rejected.
She said: "In view of this, the JDC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Board today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating labour-fighting measures that will begin in early September.
The disputes led to six strikes this year, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS.
The head of the BMA Assistant Doctors Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which were held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors would be forcibly introduced in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin’s smile seemed narrow-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained circumstances.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his “dear friend” Putin – according to a report five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite.
But a sustained coolness radiating from Putin showed that the head of state of Russia had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the firing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin split and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia.
The crime was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed like the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he wanted to hear from President Erdogan.
Russia has won some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are obvious.
Erdogan needs in the first place all the friends he can get after he was almost removed from office last month in a failed coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic reasons.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has decreased by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved if the flights are resumed.
You count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it sees its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.
Add to this the ongoing resentment over the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to take advantage of the cool mood and reduce Turkey’s relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present, as an analyst once described to me, an “alliance of outsiders”: two countries that feel rejected by the West and poorly treated and are now allies.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they hadn’t even stripped the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator for Syria can be found.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand should be reduced to a back-office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has distanced itself since it nearly collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used “RBS” to protect other end consumer financial brands.
She supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralized headquarters and the stock market listing will switch to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for retail business that will get more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed by customers and staff in Inverness-shire during a tour.
He told BBC Scotland, “The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand that our employees will be employed by as we become more of a bank of brands.”
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I am now saying that we are not pursuing global goals, but local ones.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
“It’s time for us to become the Bank of Brands, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, focusing on customer needs and not our own, I think you’ll see a lot of changes.
We can relaunch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000th win on Predilection at Newmarket
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th win
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He relied on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, to mark a milestone on his local track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who previously won on Ghayyar, said, "It's special."
I am very emotional because my family is here too.
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I landed here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori takes on the cheer as he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race – Jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time derby winner, had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern age and it’s no surprise that he has reached this milestone few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that sets him apart from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma have inspired fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would already have won 6,000 profits if he wasn’t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has ridden winners in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori Celebrated the Milestone with a Typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A whole range of major tournament wins, including his famous "Glorious Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially had difficulties when he returned from his six-month ban, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he’s far from finished – Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until he’s at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin’s closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.
In a statement, the Kremlin said that Putin, without giving reasons, “ordered Ivanov’s dismissal from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration.”
Anton Vaino, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, has been appointed as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin’s website it is stated (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and chief of staff of government personnel.
Speaking of his appointment, he said to Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your activities as head of state with regard to draft legislation and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces persuade?
This move has made Moscow a mystery.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest confidants and works for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced of this - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of some kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim – that a man who was once touted as a potential president wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy at once – came across great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said, “It is true that in early 2012, in a conversation, I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated post – one could almost say – for four years.
As it turns out, I have been president of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took over the post in December 2011.
Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation last month on the set of the series in Los Angeles.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement its termination.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized publicly on Thursday prior to the announcement of his termination.
On the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character is written out of the series that follows a team of FBI agents are expected to be released at a later date, according to the comments of ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the series since the first season of the series in 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart into it for the last 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won’t be possible now.
I would just like to thank the authors, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and above all the best fans you can wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery about fish that landed in Garden in Banff
A resident of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandals spied out of a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge Now Connected to Fife
The $1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct – meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "top fan" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 oblique ropes.
The $1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economics Secretary Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of a truly epic engineering skill in this project of over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit.
Altogether, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck is getting a concrete cast for the deck today in Rosyth, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first lock represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents pioneering construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the Nordturm deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at a slope of about 3%.
Happiness, since the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Thankfully, everything went very well.
Salvation in Moelfre Bay: Three men have 'lucky to be alive'
Three men have “happiness to be alive” after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station hit the alarm on Friday at 13:20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim safely while their boat continued to move on its own.
“We saw the boat around her and imagined the worst,” said Moelfre Vince Jones, head of the rescue station.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we let it to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station.
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop, but when the boat was detached from the person who controlled the boat.
Someone watched over these men today.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and was seriously injured.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had been given the key to the apartment to get his personal belongings.
Instead, the alcoholic cut the clothes of his ex-girlfriend.
When she came into the apartment, he hit her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in his hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend’s clothes, he called his mother.
He then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to reassure her brother.
But she couldn’t get him out of the apartment.
That's why she left the house with her partner.
On the street, they met the man’s ex-husband.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens believe that investors should be taken into account much more in the future.
How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "action concept for housing" at the next Council meeting.
Disputes are programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: Who should build the cheap apartments?
So far, there has been a lack of regulation.
SPD Group chairman Christoph Bratmann says: “We agree with the Greens: Anyone who wants to build on urban areas will have to identify 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future.”
However, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock.
However, the big issue in the city hall is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private space?"
“We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the housing as social housing.”
A new urban housing funding programme, which will cost millions and still has to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the groups."
The CDU wants investors to make as few regulations as possible.
The left wants tough conditions for investors.
Nevertheless, Bratmann says, try to exacerbate the situation on the housing market.
If the action concept is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.
But the program is not yet complete: because the around 1,260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how to compensate for the loss of another 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
To prevent this, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should now be bought from the city.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring homes back into the price chain.
This is possible in the West.
The problem could be solved at once.
For in the west city deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back into the price binding for cheap apartments.
Only: the owners, the housing companies don’t want that.
Because if the number of social housing in the western city is increased again drastically, one distances oneself from the goal of so-called mixing.
A concentration of social weaknesses in only a few districts should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be some movement in the discussion.
Group chairman Holger Herlitschke said: "The CDU has to get on board with a large majority."
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
However, this does not mean that no compromise can be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness worthwhile
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teens and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.
Of course I am referring to the Pokémon Go Madness, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later an animated series, playing cards and other spin-offs).
Like many phenomena of pop culture, interest dropped slightly before the game was released in the US, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
Market launch in other countries has been delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped from the sofa to search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps taken by the “average” person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of tracked people exercising 30 minutes every day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who is playing Pokémon Go – it only sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public health education campaigns that want to get people to “take 30 minutes to get out of the sofa,” and “be active every day” came across deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's up?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn’t give us any reason to do sports like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and its use will subside over time.
However, due to Pokemon’s success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles makes gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Breathtaking on the ground.
On the whole brilliant.
And finally an Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-combat title on Thursday, widening the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
Their total score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
The American woman Simone Biles plays on the float during the women's single multi-competition final in art gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-combat title and the fifth overall, while strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even at all.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end in that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 world champion medals – including 10 gold medals – with such amazing exercises that include a blend of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is “the best gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
She was expecting a final test in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold would be considered a disappointment.
American women Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the women's single multi-competition finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never having planned the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of her ground exercises – which include her typical Tumbling Pass – are tuned to Latin American music that would fit on the street outside Rio’s Olympic arena.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman was training, became a force.
She has not lost a multi-competition competition since the summer of 2013, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Although Mustafina easily led through two turns, the picture was misleading.
Floating beams and ground gymnasiums - in which Biles holds the world championship title - lurked.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put another on it with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently hugged her as they awaited her final fall - a pure formality - and tears poured on Bile's shiny red, white, and blue eyeliners as the vision she once described in her book became reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time she fought for third place four years ago, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old crew captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.
After her ground exercise, she threw kissing hands at the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old’s fast-growing tweet from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 killed in serial murder case while listening to music in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix’s first serial killer case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report read.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take along the handbags or the $2,900 owned by one of the adult victims.
Police spokesman for Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting led investigators to get a closer look at whether it was linked to four previous attacks.
In all, seven people were killed and two more injured within four months, mainly in Hispanic residential areas.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of a house," Howard told CBS's KHPO, a subsidiary, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized for her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah still died on the spot.
One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting targeting an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, assuming it was the serial killer’s work.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-Year-Old with Microcephaly: 'It's Getting Better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys, and of course his mother.
But like most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can’t do it.
I can't do it.
I didn't agree with that.
What's not right at all -- of course they got involved," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her have been told that Edmund may never recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
“My first answer was, ‘I didn’t know people were still doing that,’” Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund couldn’t sit or crawl until he was three years old and he still can’t speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk and cycle with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund conceived for "Please sing me something."
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto recalls the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking what was going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I haven’t asked for the prognosis for a long time because I don’t expect someone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It's getting better.
You know it will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, flooding gives rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale floods in Louisiana forced the governor to declare the emergency on Friday, and it is expected to see more rainfall throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi flooded their shores, threatening large-scale flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the move to assist the affected communities.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed across large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service reported that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
A flood warning system was deployed in southern Alabama on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The River Committee near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish poses a danger, as these will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas over the treaded rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still plucking people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson districts in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water poured in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high point of the river.
Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said emergency respondents had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flood had “spread out quickly” as there were still heavy rains and that authorities are considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil has been considerably sucked by the rains since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road floods caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and class failure in five school districts.
The CBS daughter broadcaster WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa had 200 flooded houses.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which were now flooded.
Robby Miller said the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets who were washed up by the flood.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water begins to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond in the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents, who hope to be able to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississipp, emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison County said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of houses were reported as flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, Manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "Poored by bullets", survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time a six-year-old child has been shot this week.
The boy's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents said that Brown suffered several gunshot injuries, including in the lobe, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious while being transported to the hospital.
"He's been through a lot, his little body was perforated by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe that.
The boy’s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy’s family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He should have started the first class in a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether the perpetrator could be among one of the injured men.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a crossfire between several shooters.
Patron sleeves for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles sewn on the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the walkway, there were sleeves.
So there seem to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police officer Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests were made and police are currently reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a slap on her arm while playing outside her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane.
She recovers and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I imagine in the women’s Olympic team in gymnastics and for more than one reason.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring for many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this team that rounds out Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
That shows strength.
In the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievements of triple world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering unexpected yet masterful gym routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-fighting event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We’re experiencing the top of this sport, but that’s not what gymnastics classes across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five", because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily pay in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishings, travel, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gym clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started doing gymnastics.
We need to enable communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to have a more affordable and accessible gymnasium.
I founded my gymnasium for 20 years.
At my events, we provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as academic and professional success.
It’s the inspiration of this team that gets thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that’s great.
It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant Doctors Want to Organize Further Strikes After Refusing Jeremy Hunt's Proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying that the NHS would be in a “no-man’s-land” and any further delay would be detrimental to employees and patients.
The first assistant doctors will receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at hazardous times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistant Doctors, said: "Assistent doctors continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress needs to be made and time runs out.
Attempts by the BMA to resolve the disputes by means of talks came upon the government with reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.
This happened from a promise Jeremy Hunt made last month that his door would always be open.
“Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition, and address the concerns of the assistant doctors.”
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further labour-fighting measures.
The last strike at the end of April foresees a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage to doctors on the strike post chain.
The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekly salary for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, general manager of the NHS staff, urged the assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Work-fighting measures achieve nothing of the little, but already overloaded teams and service providers and only cause patients, caregivers and their families worries, distress and interruption."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistant Doctors and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other key issues – such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training expenses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave, and gender pay gap in medicine – were a sign of how serious it was for employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health in February regarding compliance with the agreements with the B.
The 2-per-day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a 2-per-day drug after being recommended by the authorities to administer it to more people for a longer period of time.
The anti-coagulation drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given for as long as 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended a four-year intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form coatings.
When the covering breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another one.
Produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, Ticagrelor reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
The NICE guideline draft published today recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Center, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of another heart attack can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.
Information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.
Culture of Political Correctness Blows Election Fraud in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year on the basis of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud knowingly being ignored in Muslim communities, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers, and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to “hypersensitivities to ethnicity and religion.”
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidating voters for religious reasons would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up barriers outside of polling booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voters only need to give their name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person’s finger when they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
“This not only serves to protect the municipal government against election fraud, but also against the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in eastern London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed from office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community in a cynical way” and that he had silenced his critics with racist and Islamophobic accusations.
Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to vote for him.
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He was particularly alarming about the fraudulent postal election – in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including keeping ID cards to prove identity.
The report states: “It has been appropriated as evidence that pressure has been exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
"There was concern that... state institutions knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivities to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from editing election papers to stop “election harvesting.”
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the election directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person’s finger once they’ve cast their voice to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person’s nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic postal elections.
Prohibition for political activists to process full postal elections and envelopes of postal elections.
Give the police the power to set up barriers to electoral stations.
A law amendment that facilitates an intimidation charge under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Prohibition of photographs in polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).
Intensifying training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the ballot box alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges were filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices,” he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective “take-off checks” of the city halls’ electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's judgment in Tower Hamlets was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, has a proud heritage, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's bicyclist and other famous bicyclists of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week over the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot out of the box, which has proven to be an impressive double of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympionikin is by no means the only gold-fighting athlete to have his own famous doppelganger – at least not if you can believe the social media.
In honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of olympics that have more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since his childhood
Aside from Kate’s double on the cyclist track, many people on the Internet pointed out what a certain archer could be like to the twin of A-star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. archery team, has caused an onslaught on Twitter after images he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star appeared.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing from childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much similarity myself, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good looking guy, so I think I'll take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come to the fore this year: the resounding resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a double for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
One gait higher: This user believes Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another long-running comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than the sun-tanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an “athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Strong women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: a Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
Theory put into space: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical.”
In fact, US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in the gymnasium Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful, wide smile, similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer “deceased like a pig”
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place at dr 4x200m freestyle swimming squad outraged viewers of CBC live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “departed like Mief” and died like a pig during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming squad.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentator team to add more "colour," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like moss, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the swimming squad 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to unlock the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "deceased like a pig"????
The idiot didn’t realize they were still on the show.”
Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows at the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimsuit for women: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many putting him to the test
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: “Wow, byronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists.
Shortly after, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald’s comment, saying, “We apologize for the comment on a swimming performance broadcast.”
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we are sorry that it happened.”
CBC apologized over 90 times to people who responded to the comments on Twitter
Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC copied and pasted its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald’s comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on TV and our followers on social media last night.
To be clear, Byron’s comments were about the swimmer’s performance and not about her as a person.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and an unfortunately chosen wording, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
“I’d like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women’s swim in the CBC Olympics,” he said.
“I was referring to the swimmer’s performance and not to her as a person.”
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry.”
Buyer in Primark outraged by woman who shamelessly tries underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers didn’t know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try out underpants.
To aggravate the situation, she patterned what she looked like in it, pulled out and put her back on the shelf.
She continued browsing and tried four pairs of underpants at a store at Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on the underwear, “she dressed again and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the showcase, took off her own pantyhose and pants and tried them on.
“She didn’t even try to find a more discreet place to do it – she just stood there, naughty like Oskar.”
“Everyone stared as she took off her underwear, which she obviously didn’t like, as she put it back on the shelf.”
She repeated the same with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, dressed up again and went out.
“She didn’t seem to bother that she was watching someone – or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she had tried.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that were wearing another person and that weren't washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, “As I learned, employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she left – which is just as good.”
“I would hate going home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and pulling them out again and they weren’t washed.”
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our Folkstone branch on Tuesday, August 9.
All of the products in question have been withdrawn from the sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
Whether approaching you from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to turn the skewer around for your robber.
When approaching you from behind, you should first turn around so that you can see your attacker and “get off the line of fire,” Mizrachi says.
Then grab the gun between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it in the face with your free elbows.
Then hit him with the knee in the groin and twist, as the attacker curves in pain, the gun out of his hands. Hit him in the face with the run and move backwards as they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, lower the weight on the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.
But keep in mind that in case of a robbery it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are not a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright Shaves His Tongue in Europe's Dirtiest Places for a Travel Guide
A British traveller underwent a serious examination of his immune system and strangler reflex - by licking off some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, scraped his trains on a euro bill, a railing on the Piccadilly Circus, a wash button on a train toilet, and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get involved with.
But the experiment, filmed under the title “The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength,” brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking the sink of a pulling toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his trip through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and healthcare professionals about promoting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing the resilience of his gut by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to flushing buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
“As a child, I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water.”
In the film, he certainly lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample smear showed a luminometer count of over 4,000 units.
By comparison, the luminometer count of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to leak after their luminometer count was over 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom
In the film, he says, “That comes close to the worst thing I’ve smelled in a toilet.”
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I won't lick anything here because it's disgusting inside.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamins C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We did crazy brainstorming that ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let me say so – I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the movie.”
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I’m glad we recorded some of these dirty treats on film.”
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products that contain enclosed lactic acid bacteria.
Asocial family destroyed before delogging social apartment in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left their social home after delogging with a damage of $50,000 for terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their estate, shocked housing cooperative employees found the property in an irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floors were torn open, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated onto the walls.
The family has been relocated and it is believed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for the property management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment could no longer be repaired.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don’t have to live that way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably be considered a not so beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime, and police said the terror the family had inflicted included street fighting with baseball bats, intimidators from local residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, quarreling, and cursing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage has been found
In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floors were torn open.
Neighbors said they saw them fighting in the street and had to be called to police regularly.
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogged her and her partner from the property this week after giving them an extended 11-week period to voluntarily move out.
The delogation was applauded by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we tell the police here are incredible.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
Trash and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the town hall
He added, “It’s a shame that the tenant neglected to take any responsibility for their behavior and that of their family, since delogging is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions for their neighbors had to be horrible to watch.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community have done, who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will bring comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogging
Homeowners will now have to clear out garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia, and cash in the amount of $1,700.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug in commercial terms.
She claimed the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now expected to live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will delog tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said the delogging was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
“This is for those who think they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior,” she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal panic after low-flying military jet flies over beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft made an incredible crash
The Air Force said it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists began to panic after a low-flying jet crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in tangible proximity over the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up when, understandably, they began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many vacationers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: “It flew really deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing.”
Nuno Arroja added, “I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was dropping at me.”
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were panicked when the plane came out of the dark and flew incredibly deep
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so deep that it was the only way to recognize them.
The spokesman said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to nearby land fires due to poor visibility, but the air forces insisted that safety was never endangered at any time.
Land fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly so deep due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke of fire - which restricted his vision.
The aircraft was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise.
Supercup: Barca with worries against Seville
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step to win the title in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans compete in the duel for the Spanish Supercup away against FC Sevilla, the back game rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner must refrain from Neymar, who competes with Brazil in the Olympic football tournament, among others, with the defeated Cup finalist and reigning European League champion.
Goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament sprain in the knee during training, which clarifies the one-on-one question at Barca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been competing in Barcelona for the status as number one for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far renounced a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen did so in most other competitions.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness status of the team, which was humiliated with 0:4 in a test game of Liverpool on Saturday.
Lionel Messi and Co. did not really convince at the 3-2 in the rehearsal gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville, in turn, has to digest the 2:3 defeat after prolongation in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims for the second victory in the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona is the record winner in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in his own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday (12.5.4.4).
Thus, the world ranking first took the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes in the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour Final Tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the end as expected and made the title among themselves.
This made it clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the single title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic staircase was former SVS-NÖ legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sets and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retreated to the stands and let their protégés go on their own in fair competition.
“I’ve played the matches for my country so far.
“I’m playing for myself in the final,” Zhang said.
After the game, gold and silver medal winners posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he determined the pace on the record and left Zhang only 13 points in total.
Ma’s superiority did not lead to the expected rousing match.
Nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze match against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had sustained a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then in medical treatment, had to be "finally" satisfied with tinplate.
By the way, Sweden’s Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourths at a similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits "huge problems" in election campaign
The leadership of U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump has now admitted weaknesses in his election campaign in the former Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment, when the normally high-profile and confident multimillionaire expressed something of concern, as correspondents reported.
After throwing out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing.
“We have huge problems in Utah,” Trump told evangelical Christians he asked for support in major states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
To blame are false reports of his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scolding.
Republican strongholds
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a survey by SurveyUSA in June, Trump and his rival from the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, were the same.
Other institutions see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he would like to stop Clinton’s advance again: “Just as I’ve done so far.”
And pushed after: "This will either be successful, or I will go on a very, very nice, long vacation".
He does nothing but “tell the truth.”
If it doesn’t end up being rich for political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the party has threatened Trump to cancel funds in support of his election campaign if he cannot present better poll values.
Instead, the Republican candidates for Congress should be given greater support.
Olympia: The most damaging fraud in doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya’s athletes are in danger after the second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent home a coach.
The International Olympic Committee said it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had reported that former Sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had taken a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenyan team leader by the doping controls.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to carry out its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will carry out an assessment," the IAAF said in a statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, handed over the sample and signed it," Kenya's chief de mission Stephan Arap Soi said in a statement.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the World Anti-Doping Agency’s training checklist.
Ferguson Rotich won the World Cup in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan Athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been withdrawn from the Rio Games.
He is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return to the Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special observation at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offences.
In announcing the IOC’s more than 2,000 doping target checks before the Rio Games, it was unusually previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the Summer Games to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
As a result, the WADA took Kenya from the list of countries whose doping controls are compliant with the WADA rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country’s athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
A series of TV reports by the ARD have repeatedly accused that doping funds are easily accessible in Kenya and that there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It was possible to prove that in this sport a comprehensive and systematic baptism was carried out.
Russia’s athletes were then excluded from the Summer Games.
Salzburger "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple, similar to Romeo and Julia.
It was a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a youth dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestral trench, the Simón Bolivar Orchestra under the direction of the Venetian conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he swarms.
We always say that she is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein’s music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love for Tony with pity, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there is Mary’s personality.
She says it in her song, “I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright.”
So she is smart, of course, naive, and very passionate.
“She is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman,” Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is an immensely generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You can see it in each of his movements, in his eyes, it is his life!
It’s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the West Side Story is highly up-to-date: “This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism.”
Today we have the refugees, then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New Yorkers didn’t want them.
These are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned a few weeks ago of her death in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group’s bulwark in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died, according to her family, shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is to - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - stop people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana’s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain with Garland as a Supreme Court candidate in the event of an election victory
Senate Democrat leader Harry Reid is convinced that Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland’s confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said Thursday during a conference call that he expects Clinton to select Garland “with a certain degree of certainty.”
A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not yet spoken to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton’s team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the Supreme Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland’s nomination, being lackeys and helpers to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for 'women and men'
Treats Magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to release a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Calendar for 2017.
Treats editor-in-chief Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from old-school playboys, as “playboy is for men.”
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
“We need to return to the depiction of timeless and classic nakedness in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
“Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-affiliated Dialogue and World Foundation.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of asylum seekers to flee Turkey to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even become “a few hundred thousand,” believes association chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh action of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
“In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term several hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition,” said Ali Toprak, president of the association.
Because the government overwhelmed Kurdish strongholds with penalties months ago, 500,000 Kurds are on the run within Turkey.
After the defeated coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start again in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
“It cannot be that a state that itself accepts refugees produces refugees in its own country,” Toprak said.
The head of the association lamented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevite cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
“They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been exterminated or expelled in the past hundred years,” said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association demanded that the German government “position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and its supporters.”
There is also a “witch hunt” against Erdogan critics in Germany.
I have not felt safe in Germany for the first time in the past few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and oppositionists.
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
“Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan are sitting on packed suitcases, by the way, also the Kemalists and seculars,” said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-near Foundation for Dialogue and Education, the “World”.
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already represented the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany before the coup.
By the deadline of June 30, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognized as asylum-eligible (39,625).
This survey does not include those who have fled from war, poverty or lack of prospects.
According to the Basic Law, asylum seekers are individually persecuted exclusively on the political side, i.e. on the state side.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: "Go where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, they understood.
In 2021, the state parliamentary elections will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not as stupid as it is so far: summer holidays, heat and election campaign - that bites.
The locals, who are supposed to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, traveling on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the state parliament.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, helpers hanging posters, inflating balloons, distributing flyers and counting votes at the end are only laborious to find out.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania has to let the election campaign pass just over the people.
The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.
And it’s also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD/CDU coalition, has to fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now well behind the CDU in polls.
Excitingly, how strong the newcomer AfD is and what remains at the end of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and the head of government since 2008, is making an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one refrains from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just like his legendary wordless predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the flowering of the AfD.
Her refugee policy, her “we can do this” has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to be campaigning at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel Bundestag constituency is located in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berliners and Saxons than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, CDU secretary-general in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, complained recently in the NDR.
But it does not hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeastern CDU largely renounces the usual campaign stands on market squares and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
This, Kokert says, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that you are destroying the base in the country, that it must make a great effort to find a connection with the people again.
It is like the Left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly any in the vast expanses of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to his colleagues is also self-explaining: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used".
Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly dedicated election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were 22 percent behind the CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They turn the holiday emergency into a modern virtue and largely shift their campaign to the Internet.
"Online elections," the country's chairman Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners are looking for local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is curving through the Mecklenburg Lakes with a houseboat and still finds it beautiful.

B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blocking
There is nothing to complain about the speed at which the B 27 is refurbished.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and ends only at 8 pm, there is praise everywhere.
"They did everything quite tangled," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There is no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week, as planned, by the end of October everything should be ready.
The reception of those responsible for the construction work is also praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of emergency checks.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the blocking of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was also lifted and the connection to Rottenburg also exists again, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
Citizens can now use the B 27 from Ofterdingen on both sides again.
The traffic through the place seems to be declining.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, the deputy head of the main office responsible for the transport management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to contend with more traffic noise because many searched for tugways and trusted their navigation rather than the signs.
As a result, some trucks in residential areas have been depleted.
Since the speed limits were also not met, the municipality increased the demand for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant overshoots," says King, who once informed himself about the situation on the spot.
There have been two to three flashes per minute.
The fastest was in the Tempo 30 zone with 77 kilometres per hour.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become calmer.
For the businessmen on the B 27 it is only a little comfort that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Businessmen do not like to look at the cards.
But that the B-27 remediation has led to revenue cuts, lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, have hardly any consequences for the renovation.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of a "highly slight decline" at the Maier car dealership, but also admits that of course "the running clientele is missing".
The bars along the road are the strongest.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already existentially threatening.
Not just him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard".
Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
He estimates sales losses “far over 50 percent”.
The road refurbishment has dropped its operation “by two years.”
Half of his employees were fired.
If I had a company with 4,000 employees and half had been fired, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, President Jörg Schmidt responded to a question from Göhner as to whether there could be a financial compensation by noting that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at B 27.
Göhner knows from other counties where something like this has been handled more generously.
With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it points to its long history.
He can understand that other regulars are now less frequent due to the complicated traffic management.
If you can't come here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubt that his regular clientele will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the BSE and bird flu crises, Göhner considers the impact of B-27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.
Six months of construction, that's brutal.
In the name of counter-terrorism, laws are constantly being imposed.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does toleration have to do with terrorism?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliation.
All of his proposals are “politically reasonable” to the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package.
You're not overwhelming anyone.
Other, more far-reaching issues were initially discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As a minister of the interior, however, he is keen on results and on a “realizable consensus” within the coalition.
After the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière has allowed a little time to pass before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But now they are all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Neither does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is starting a second run for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to penalize sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to knock off jihadists with double citizenship of the German passport.
“This will be difficult points for the SPD,” the CDU man admits.
He nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chances anyway.
A few new ideas will also be presented by De Maizière.
They have it in part: he plans quick procedures for deportations and more possibilities for detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and social media accounts disclosed for a security check.
With tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to put some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of them are politically and legally sensitive.
Some things also seem unfilled and leave questions unanswered.
And on some points - for example, in the unequal treatment of the patient - the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about safety in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that people were deeply concerned about could not be excluded even during election campaign times.
Internal security has become a huge focus.
Only the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
Therefore, the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking a stand on the issue of internal security.
Over the past few days, it has been high between the two parties.
Only a gruesome dispute about the equipment of the federal police, then about a security policy idea collection of some EU interior ministers, in which the heads of department also demand a burka ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also struggles to make a conciliatory note here.
He does not think of a turning away from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening it makes no sense.
In the case of a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to be revealed.
There is a lot in it that could cause a dispute.
However, the SPD is also trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security.”
Volkswagen still comes through happily.
Despite diesel scandals, the number of deliveries worldwide is rising.
But not all markets are running smoothly.
There is a whirlwind around a term in the recall.
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year with more modest deliveries.
Europe’s largest automaker can continue to show an increase in the course of the year, despite the diesel affair thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened mainly in Western Europe and thus again weighed on total sales, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
The VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide in July with 44,9100 cars than in the previous month.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent lower than last month.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries fell by almost a sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July mainly to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on the exit from the EU has also burdened, a spokeswoman explained.
In the U.S., where the emissions affair first escalated, there is also another minus to bear.
The main support for VW is the Chinese market.
Overall, the mainly affected house brand of Lower Saxony still glitches through the diesel scandal anyway: After the first seven months, only a delivery decrease of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is to be booked.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to continue to show an increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, and 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for conversion to the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW reiterated that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power.
The automaker issues the customer a "equal guarantee" certificate after the conversion, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said on Friday in business circles.
The reason is legal intricacies.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen would now give its German customers a guarantee for upgraded diesel models.
This was confirmed by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that there was a meeting.
"VW has to fully comply with the requirements of my investigative commission and the KBA."
"Deviations from this will not be accepted," said Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), according to the ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that there will be no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine power after the conversion and that all vehicle type-approval relevant values will remain unchanged.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in business circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop six months after the conversion, for example, with an engine damage - and this could be attributed to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interests of the customer, it is also important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal leads to uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations.
Therefore, VW does not use the term "guarantee".
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee is demanding penal interest from wealthy savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: “It’s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on checking or daily money accounts.”
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers should "not fear to pay for their savings penalty interest".
If banks store money overnight with the European Central Bank (ECB), they will have to pay their 0.4 percent fine.
This fee will be charged by Raiffeisenbank Gmund from September to private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on current or daily money accounts.
“The first 100,000 euros are free.”
“The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future,” Paul said.
For some time now, he has kept 40 million euros, which could be taken from one day to the next and which he could not use.
“They are in my central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the cost,” the bank chief said.
“I can’t pay $4,000 for every million.”
He now passes on the costs according to the polluter pays principle.
Leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!" said the bank's board of directors.
Most customers had understanding and switched to other forms of investment.
Only a few moved to other banks.
The Bavarian Association of Cooperatives stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks."
To carry them alone is “permanently impossible in business terms.”
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its skatbank branch in 2014 with fines for deposits starting from three million euros.
Michael Kemmer, Chief Executive Officer of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits, but competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong."
One banker said that at Lake Tegernsee there is “a clientele equipped with a bit more wealth.”
"That can be a problem for a small bank" if they keep money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund was founded in 1911 and has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
The region is home to well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs.
“There are currently no other banks known to the Bavarian Association of Cooperatives that charge an expense reimbursement for deposits of private customers,” spokesman Ernst said.
At the end of June, the president of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had stated: "The threshold for going into the negative towards the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is tough, and it threatens the emigration of investors to the competition.
The customers in Germany will not be able to enjoy this in the widest possible range.
Destination Records: Who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment section to sow it with harsh insults under the pseudonym NotAllSingle MenAge, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia.
Those who recently bought a plate are expected to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and wildly gesturing before I stop, hold my hands and say something decisive like, "So, let's take a closer look at it."
So, let's take a look at it.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm – hotels, restaurants, and offices are now filling the buildings where once independent sellers were based – there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty stores.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight middle-aged men, a woman, presumably in her 20s) is for a day because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn’t follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and buy items that he sold again when he was young and broke.
"A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, adding, “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink very much.
This is my truck.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves buying their old records again.
Of the conversations I have had, people have usually emptied themselves from their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again,” he says.
This would explain the boom of fans of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a reassuring community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that evoke happy childhood memories.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It’s an easy way to get mentally occupied.
“We are like their social workers!” whispered an employee from a plate stack.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month haven’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I scroll through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works for Sounds of the Universe (data number: three middle-aged men), has noticed a “trophy aspect” of the revival.
“Someone just came in here recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I’d like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older ones, who are slowly coming in.
Fopp, which has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a more colorful audience than I go in.
There are couples around the age of 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even though the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop is roaring out of the speakers instead of experimental jazz - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them looks so lonely, but nagging psychic trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of plates for sale.
She is more likely to make a shopping spree than a big shopping spree.
She doesn’t earn a lot, so collecting records isn’t a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is...” she drives off with a lover’s sigh.
I don’t know how to explain it – it’s really unique.
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I seem to be sampling the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping up around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley recorder.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.
No one looks at them – perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high up that it is impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there’s nothing to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don’t spend their Thursday morning strolling through Berwick Street record stores and scrolling through records while avoiding the staring gaze of a creepy, 30-year-old false moderator who towers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrates - Videoreport
Scientists say that Greenland shark has the longest life span of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was for a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a trial this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 provisional stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would pose a fire and medical risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also argued that the provisional shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expulsion of people operating the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were “absolutely understandable.”
Judge Jean-Francois Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people who “live in extremely precarious conditions.”
He said the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened by the tearing down was the camp’s Jungle Book Kids’ Café, which is nonprofit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum matters for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids’ Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said that the closure “would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old.”
The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L’Auberge the migrant estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to over 9,000 people – the highest number to date – after a steep increase in new arrivals over the course of the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing appearance in the Olympic time trial, cyclist Tony Martin does not want to be caught.
“I will keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight,” the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook before leaving Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place at the Sugarloaf.
“I honestly find it hard to comment on yesterday’s time trial,” Martin said.
He had to calmly analyze the reasons that would have led to the debacle.
Martin actually wanted to compete for the title at the time trial World Championships in Qatar in October.
“I’m going to look closely at everything we’ve changed in recent times.”
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday on the 54.5 km on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland).
Olympia: Tennis professional Siegemund missed the semi-finals
Laura Siegemund’s triumph ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: World Ranked 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1-6, 1-6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA-No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Victory mouth, which was plagued by back problems, was able to pass through their impact only once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, Angelique Kerber (Kiel/Nr. 2) still had the chance to jump into the preliminary round.
The Australian Open winner met the British woman Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis professional, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
There were two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games last 1992.
There has never been a German duo in an Olympic semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft wants to benefit from that too.
The technology group buys the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money will be spent on the acquisition, Microsoft said on Thursday.
Beam did not launch its offer until January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment items.
Activision Blizzard launches a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to a global media event, Facebook should help.
The advertising industry is already listening.
Employees of the start-up, which has so far been based in Seattle in the US state of Washington, are moving to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi announced.
For the customers, nothing should change as a result of the acquisition.
According to Microsoft, Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console.
The market of live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 – for almost a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google mother alphabet.
Here is the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s razors have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are supposed to transfer tempo-savers particularly effectively.
The futuristic Enforcement Trailers from the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident centers, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit there with a stationary flasher.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or expensive.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days in uninterrupted measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
In addition, all vehicles can be detected simultaneously across multiple tracks with laser measurement technology.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans according to time, lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the raised state you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with trailer clutch.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and incidentally also fireproof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is intended to protect the flasher from vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and has now also been used.
Foreign authorities are also blinking with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 units, after an order of 150 units last year.
UK wins silver in 7-er rugby after Fiji Masterclass wins gold
Britain’s impressive performance in 7-seater rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis when they were beaten with a 43-7 result at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side stepping, pushing back, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the silver medal's not too bad consolation price - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the boxers, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form in this form.
It could be a consolation for GB – but it probably won’t – that at least one British man will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, the former chief for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult way to go.
Eight years ago they lost under Ryan every match at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This lap will hurt, but progress is amazing.
Fiji started off wonderfully and let the attacks of GB bounce off out of fun.
It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. as if they were running on buses, and the World Series winners went up 5-0 as Osea Kolinisau pulled over in the corner.
With four more minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai launched yet another right-hand attack that he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
A formidable tackle from Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravou pushed through further weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.
It’s like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
That's the way it is.
GB made fundamental half-time changes and closed the Fiji gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interlude from Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has been going for a long time in favor of the South Sea islanders, whose fans were singing, waving flags and dancing on the stand.
It was not hard to admire Fiji’s playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the i-cup with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked crushingly in the lawn.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5, and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a tight semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the boxing forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line with an impressive footwork and scored a goal under the posts in the second half.
A brilliant late tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fight with the coach's cancer for rowing victory
There will be no more emotinating gold than in these games and that means something.
From the first row to the last, 220 hard Hieve going into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
The echo of coach Robin Williams, who was all present when they rowed for the second consecutive Olympic gold medal in a pair without a tax woman, were the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Their dominance was absolute, at least their 39th unbeaten commitment, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the way of triumph.
Behind each gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers contributing to the incremental advances that make the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who 30 months ago didn’t know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.
If you don’t, it spreads everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes the outlook a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is even the right term under such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to deal with his own fears.
Stanning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much that means to me, how much Helen and Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him. He's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wanted a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm that their opponents couldn’t keep up with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to unlock, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught in the moment.
Helen shouted "stay in trial, stay in trial."
It’s really important not to be carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren’t looking to do something great.
We didn’t want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover is due to appear at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,” she said.
Provided exemplary clarity for 31 years
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, retires.
The association is considered to be "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was some time ago in the original tone in a contribution from the Bavarian Radio.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia appreciated the purpose association.
The Veitenstein group’s work was considered “exemplary throughout Bavaria”.
Rupert Göller, who has been an employee for 31 years, is behind all of this, including 28 years as managing director.
He was retired at the age of 65.
The Drinking Water Association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, in the municipality of Breitbrunn, produces about 150,000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
The municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a water guard in 1985 and was already appointed Managing Director of the purpose association in 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance to office and organisational activities, budgeting, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," the chairman said.
As outstanding events she mentioned the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountains (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountains (1998) and compensation of farmers, the refurbishment of the high tanks (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There was no halt and innovations were repeatedly taken up, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller’s faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of heart and soul for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitenstein Group on nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best waterman and he was a faithful man.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he referred to the well construction and the restructuring of the purpose association as highlights.
However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult use was the breaking of pipes at the high container near Kirchlauter on January 3.
Here at minus 17 degrees will have to work all night long so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko openly deals with her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When her son was diagnosed with the disease, she believed she had to die.
But the now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
“To give an example, when I ask him something that was two years ago when I sang at Scala in Milan, he doesn’t remember anything,” Netrebko said.
He is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Man shoots at partner in Bargteheide
A 35-year-old man shot his partner at around 10.45 a.m. on Friday in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) and fatally injured her.
“The man himself called us and stated that he had shot his life partner,” a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him is publicly sought.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, brown-burned and has a baldness.
Meanwhile, the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile, the man wears a bare.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, the police said.
Whoever sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police speak of a “relationship.”
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide any information about the origin of the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, but they confirmed that a person had been killed.
“It’s a murder crime.”
"We are not saying anything else at the moment," said a police spokeswoman in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene of the crime.
Steel - Vision for the German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared millions of dollars in additional costs.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity production are off the table.
It remains with the exemption from the renewable energy levy at the existing plants for so-called own-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
“I’m really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations.”
The European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to pay for gases from the blast furnace for their own consumption.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ that there is now a principle agreement with the European Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced will an EEG levy of 20 percent apply.
However, this is not the case in the steel industry either.
The IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on own-power generation.
This largely sets the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel’s successful efforts are of particular importance to the steel industry.
“In terms of our ‘steel is the future’ campaign, that’s a first step.”
“More have to follow.”
"Climate and employment targets must also be considered in the reform of emissions trading," said IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and significant price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation worsened further when the world’s largest producer country, China, massively threw steel onto the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has relaxed a bit.
On the one hand, import tariffs on import steel have an effect, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
The German industry prime Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Finally, prices stagnated again.
The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Lastly, Thyssenkrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.
In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
With 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous month, according to the Wirtschaftsvereinigung Stahl on Friday.
After a brief increase in May, the amount produced now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than in the previous year.
The association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, Mind, Health: Singing Does Seniors Good
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's degree she took the subject music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
“Singing moves me emotionally and physically,” she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful, and overall more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good to her health and her mind.
Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of the music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
By being together on a regular basis, seniors can establish and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp has also made this experience in her choir: "Talk up and organize, be able to rely on others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be stressful in a positive sense, says Hackler.
This is because seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Anyone who regularly calls his lungs does not get out of the bust so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together was much more important, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia remember long ago events.
When singing, the head is also required a special performance, explains Lenz.
Focusing on your own voice and a predetermined rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not just focusing on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you get by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows by singing in the choir.
To show yourself: If I practice for a long time, I get better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
There are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a tone goes by?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the surrounding choirs.
Anyone who wants to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.
Many seniors choirs can also be found on the Internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbors for help with your internet search.
Anyone who wants to sing should definitely join a choir, Hackler advises.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this applies to all ages.
Cats are more sensitive than cats to the screams of the young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the miowing also did not leave the males cold - but, unlike the females, they always behaved the same way.
Female cats can detect the degree of excitement of cat babies at the miows of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds of kittens, which are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary University and the Medical University of Hanover (MHH) have found.
Cats also respond to the calls of kittens – but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the miowing of less and strongly excited young animals are either not perceptible or not significant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten cry differs with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult cats and eight kittens from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were played calls from little ones who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screaming of more excited kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All the females, even those who did not have their own offspring, responded to the screams in a differentiated manner," Konerding said.
They turned faster to the loudspeaker when this sounded the calls of the much more excited kittens.
This ability may be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.
“A surprise was that the males responded at all,” the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby noise in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women were more sensitive to infants, whether they were already mothers or not, reported biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match will take place in Turkey.
Before the arch rivals’ duel between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski’s Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: “Business as usual” is imminent.
Already when the state of emergency was imposed after the attempted overthrow in July, the government said that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the attempted coup.
There is no stopping before football either.
Against the former Starkicker Hakan Sükür, the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group now living in the United States.
Sükür is said to be a supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency initially imposed for 90 days still applies until October, in fact this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
The nightly “democracy watches” in public places across the country has declared Erdogan to be finished on Wednesday.
The sport, like the whole country, is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Fans of the workers’ club Besiktas in particular are traditionally not among the president’s friends.
But what unites most of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coupes.
Even the fans agree - whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
In the case of cup winner "Gala" it will be particularly important to Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne player demonstrated his sporting value in the past season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as top scorer of his club.
In the final game against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1-0 win.
The newspaper “Fanatik” praised him: “He was the best on the pitch.”
He finished the season in a great way and secured the trophy for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi", the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the pre-round K.o in the Champions League, the "Lion" also left early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only the sixth place.
The season was not good.
The trophy was the only way to win.
“We did that and that’s the most important thing,” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who put the basis for the 14th title with 26 season goals as a Süper-Lig-Torschützenkönig.
This is also why fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
Gomez, who was under contract with AC Florence and only borrowed from Besiktas, had announced after the coup attempt that he would not return due to the political situation in the country after his EM holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," said club boss Fikret Orman.
But the striker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary, estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence."
Despite Doping: These Athletes Still Have Medal Opportunities at Olympics in Rio
The 34-year-old Justin Gatlin has been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh at it - they fight for medals in Rio.
The topic of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Julija Jefimowa, who had filed her right to start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was ruthlessly whistled out and bent out at her start (100 meters chest).
It was a whimsical scene: with a put on smile, she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was determined that she was not going to get gold, the audience broke into a jubilant storm.
But there are many other athletes who, despite the doping past, start at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-Staffel/USA): The 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has been running even faster than before, being the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and being considered Usain Bolt’s biggest challenger.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m-Staffel/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic and seven-time World Champion had to sit off a six-month suspension in 2010 after she was proven to be taking the painkiller oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after surgery, the 29-year-old defended herself.
Sandra Perkovic (Discuss/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 was tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the knowing take and was suspended for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m-Staffel/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had been tested positive in 2010 and locked for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt asserted.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world to date.
Ivan Tichon (Hammerwurf, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently denied so many medals.
Tichon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title because of testosterone abuse.
He also received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games on the basis of a verdict of the International Sports Court CAS.
At 80.04 m, he is ranked second in the world ranking.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was not tested positive until May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
In the case of the 29-year-old world champion, evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement was found, the ban on the world anti-doping agency WADA was mild and expired on July 13.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital, but was able to leave it again.
She planned her return in early September.
Whether the other explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also Austrian citizens is unclear for the time being.
In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded on Thursday evening in a nightlife district.
According to police, one Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, two more bombers were killed, according to the authorities.
A bomb explosion was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
During the detonation near the beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured.
In Surat Thani, on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.
According to the authorities, the explosives had been blown up in a flower bed in front of the area of the coastal police.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast claimed several injuries.
It is believed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin.
“The bombings carry the same handwriting,” Army General Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
“We assume that this is a coordinated attack.”
It’s too early to comment on possible motives – but it’s probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks that is typical of the bombing attacks by Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurrection movement or to international terrorism.
“This is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces,” a spokesman said in Bangkok.
Instead, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received intelligence notices of imminent attacks in the south of the country – but they have not been informed of the exact time and places.
It is not yet clear which group is behind the attacks.
Police ordered their officials across the country to increase security around major government buildings, as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and amusement districts.
There are always smaller bombings in Thailand, but they are not usually targeted at tourists.
Hua Hin is home to a palace used for years by Thailand’s King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its homepage to strictly follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, not necessary travel to these provinces is advised.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drawn up by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves towards stability, economic improvement and tourism.
The military subna, who seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody riots, maintains that it has benefited itself to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get a grip on the insurrection of Muslim rebels that has been swelling in the extreme south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have been killed in the conflict.
Nearly a year ago, 20 people were killed in a bombing of a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country’s recent history.
The right-wing “identitarian movement” has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the constitutional defenders in the federal government also put the group under surveillance.
“We see in the ‘identitarian movement’ indications for efforts against the free democratic basic order,” said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection at the German Press Agency in Berlin.
In this way, migrants from the Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That is why we are watching the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multiculti-delusion", "uncontrolled mass migration" and the "loss of one's own identity through alienation".
Constitutional defenders in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians".
Maaßen said his authority had closely coordinated the decision with the state offices.
“Groups like the ‘Identity Movement’ are trying to pick up their target group where it stands,” the head of the constitutional protection said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with pop music.
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not bad advertising for your own cause.
Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction by certain persons who are extremist and thus becomes extremist.
It is therefore decisive whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
In view of the significant increase in law-based crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But in recent years we have found that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the ‘Old School Society’ or the Freitaler Group.
There may well be other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups that are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee shelters or attacks for other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of legal terrorism is not recognizable.
The previous groups have emerged at the regional level or on social networks.
Maaßen was concerned that many attacks were carried out on the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodations were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, which may have been politically indifferent or have voted for, for example, the CDU, the SPD or the left, but which have then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist moods."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an Internet hit
The Olympics or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This is demonstrated by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
In the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily unable to be seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
On social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his lead with a backlog of 48 seconds and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly athletic figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still participate in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian received a special start right from the international swimming association.
This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more popular.
Since most athletes run in Ethopia, I just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the round.
Some media referred to him as the "Robel of the Whale".
Based on a "well-being belly", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only beat with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, didn’t matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani’s run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a run over 100 meters of freestyle.
Moussambani was cheered up at the time.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never made such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a store at the New Place has been robbed.
According to police, the 67-year-old Geretsrieder had left her shop at around 5.30 p.m. on Monday and forgot to close a window on the ground floor.
When she came back the next morning at 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump does not see the election defeat as close.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is speaking at an election event in Florida.
If it doesn’t turn out to be a U.S. president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's just going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would not care: "Ultimately, it will either work out, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with US television station CNBC.
If it doesn’t end up being rich for political correctness, that’s okay, Trump said.
This is how he described US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton as founders of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
More and more resistance has formed within his party.
Post enters the trade of electric transporters
An electric delivery vehicle from Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle seems to be great.
The Post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The company plans to start trading with the transporter shortly.
From next year, the Post will also offer its electric transporters on the free car market.
“We want to get into the sale to third parties,” a post-spoke spokesman said on Friday.
For months, the company has been testing whether to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, which delivers letters and packages, to other companies.
Post-Chairman Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always demands, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles soon.
In the post-owned factory, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and aim for a complete transition to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
“We are going to make a very, very robust step towards 2020,” he said at the end of July.
I can imagine we're changing the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany’s roads since 2014.
GfK leadership leaves after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly, but not surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK indicated that the longer the successes he promised, the more uncertain the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann becomes.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the management, the world’s number five in the industry is facing a new start for personnel.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board, Arno Mahlert, is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September.
The management of the Board of Management was taken over as early as 1 September by the previous member of the Board of Management Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company announced.
He should officially take on the role of "Chairman" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As the reason for the resignations, the company cited "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman said no details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is still unclear.
In investor circles it was said on Friday that the most recent disappointment among shareholders was the lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years," it said.
In view of the recent poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will eventually become uneasy.
“If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same,” he said.
After setbacks in the previous quarters, the company was unable to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the same quarter last year.
In relation to the first half of the year, sales decreased by 3.4 percent at EUR 721.2 million.
The profit in the second quarter was mainly burdened by the company’s decreased value in view of its difficult economic situation.
The 139 million euros worth-of-money depreciation required in the Consumer Experience business unit resulted in a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips in Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
Eight people were injured in an accident in a coach with 43 seniors as passengers on Thursday in Krummhörn, Aurich County.
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach, according to her, had to avoid a compliant truck, which partly drove on the back lane.
The bus came off the street to the right and slipped into a ditch, as a police spokeswoman Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus independently," she said.
The fire department liberated the inmates.
Six ambulances and one ambulance came to the accident site on the Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured passengers were taken back by a regular bus to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There you should wait for a replacement bus from the travel company.
Investigators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
The fees per cubic metre of sewage will start on 1 October 2016 for the Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl sewage system 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
In the case of the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest if appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
According to a detailed calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the household by the Landratsamt Kulmbach found that undercovers were created for these sewage systems.
The Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-compensating manner on the basis of legal basis.
From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the wallet.
Fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As managing director Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the wastewater systems of the market community was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt reasoned that all three sewage systems were relatively small facilities with a very small amount of sewage, which ranged from 6800 to 12,000 cubic meters per year.
Due to the low distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious effect.
In addition, the amount of waste water in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, for all three plants, not least due to their age, renovation and repair expenses were incurred to a considerable extent.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced at the Azendorf sewage plant due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumping plant, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up, and at the Lopp pond treatment plant, after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water regulations in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses included the ongoing care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011/2012 were still well below the current level.
Steinhäuser made it clear that with the low amount of wastewater in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance are "full".
Schmidt added that the market community has been spared major maintenance costs for sewage systems over the past 20 years.
Steinhäuser believes that the situation for these facilities will remain precarious in the long term, especially since the supply area of the Wastewater Association Friesenbachtal cannot be extended by these facilities because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria hits inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% on a monthly basis in July.
This is the highest figure (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% were recorded.
The annual average inflation rate of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8% measured by CPI.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, a price increase was observed for the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat 'Anime' Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filter tool, Snapchat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog, or a figure that could be made of a Roy lightstone painting.
The filters are blunt, feature-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million enhanced selfies per day.
All missteps come to the public.
Snapchat filters have in the past attracted criticism in which they have been accused that the app would promote Blackface or promote white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it suggested to some users this week a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage became widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: The filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as a cartoon of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet was widely disseminated through the photos, wrote that the filter was “injurious and, to say the least, unpleasant.”
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow face, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the degrading extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people – who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts – might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat’s filters creates an image that’s offensive to a user, “thus it’s much harder for such things to go unnoticed than they used to be,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asking others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in hiring practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership, and ended her essay with a hashtag: “DeleteSnapchat.
“Either she doesn’t have a diverse representation of people with different skin colors in her workforce so they can make such decisions,” said the Chinese-American Zhu, “or they have people with different skin colors who work there but aren’t in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it.”
Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points out its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a human resources manager focused on underrepresented populations and internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said she will leave her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that’s not OK.”
Military leadership falsify ISIS intelligence, Congressional Committee finds
U.S. Central Command military personnel changed intelligence to create a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigative committee reported in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Wehrbudget Committee, reports great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence analysts, who reported how superiors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, or Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information, typically nicknamed by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly drew a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report.
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable – our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders,” said Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership mistakes in Centcom range to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report shows in detail persistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi armed forces.
Although there is no direct evidence that government tops under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their precepts to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements, and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts,” the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," said Mike Pompeo, Kansas Republican congressman, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the tops of the Central Command changed intelligence reports to downplay the threat posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force after they were credited with analysts worrying about manipulating reports about the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway by the Defence Department’s inspector-general.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, which coincided with some of the Republican Task Force’s conclusions.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services,” said Adam B. Schiff, a member of the House of Representatives, in a statement.
This process, Mr. Schiff said, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaging morale among analysts, and "gave excessively little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had found no evidence of White House intervention among Centcom analysts regarding a “certain political opinion.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon’s inspector general, which were taken after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on reports from Congress while the inspector-general’s investigations are still ongoing.
But he also stated that “experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Defense Ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense.”
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim made by a growing number of members of the Defense Ministry).
But last year’s allegations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the Islamic State’s secret information is reminiscent of quarrels from more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small occupying force in Iraq and spent little time thinking about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, noted that, contrary to the government’s statements, airstrikes against the Islamic State-owned refineries would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had commissioned provisional refineries to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's then commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a Senate hearing.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.
The U.S. wins fourth women’s field hockey match, a showdown with Britain is imminent
One day after she scored three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the women’s American field hockey team in a match against India on Thursday that the Americans won 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn’t remember ever having done that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I'm not one of those people who keeps their goals in mind.
However, she knows this: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on the same level in their group with the British, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will win first and second place within their group of six teams.
The first place will stay out of the way of the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of the game on Saturday, the American women have sparked a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they ended up in the last of 12 places at the past London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time had a hockey stick in her hands at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16, she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became the coach of the national team and things started to turn for the better.
"A culture change, a mental change, and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn’t have the workload in London we have now.
We were able to pull the helm completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a hand-back from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She carried out a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the center and flung the ball into the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had to score one goal in each of the previous games.
She's got a run.
Same with Bam.
“We are in a good position,” Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.
Amid the rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter what time it is, it’s the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a fast-paced race between competition and aspirations.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from crossbow shooter to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor talking in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and is a swarm of women with dimples, could well have been among those well-known names that are broadcast at Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade, are the sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breast swimming and may it rule for a long time.
But if I may modestly make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely for the last 16 years that many who I had asked didn’t know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and by 2012 had an athlete who made it to the finals.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jump has a certain outer arm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but just an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon tremor of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means "springboard."
Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air, and have a series of falling movements (turns, pikes and saltos) before landing on their feet.
They are rated according to the official Olympic program by execution, difficulty level and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Gold medalists have to go on, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down in the playground.
They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also in the television broadcast another mockery goal: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to make even a spectator cry.
But it’s also what I find a bit tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline provides a breathing break.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Again, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It’s as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can be.
The women’s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men’s on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil.
If the increase in awareness can only be achieved by addressing and objectifying male athletes - as the male U.S. turners recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his new fan base, which is struggling for air.
A generation protests in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia came across violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police during gunfire changes.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, protests against the government have shaken the country and spread to more and more territories.
Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
The government’s response was ruthless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.
Circulating videos of the protests, presumably from last or early this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now demanding an in-depth investigation.
“It has always been difficult to hold this country together and it will be even more difficult in the future,” said Rashid Abdi, project manager of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia’s economy was expanding at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even though Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy – human rights organizations have continued to lead government oppression – opposition in the country has been curtailed, effectively silenced by dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vast desert.
But that could change.
“If you oppress people and they have no other options except to protest, it breaks out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The entire youth is protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a fight for this quirky, controversial line cost hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could take advantage of the turbulence and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of sighing under the surface.
The first one seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies hiding where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathering for protests.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But that is also changing.
“We are coordinating under a umbrella,” said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and is dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unpublished illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly savvy in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special envoys to work on opponents and make them harmless.
“The current regime lacks this fundamental skill,” said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen to take the position of Mr Meles for relatively opaque reasons.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, seemed to have been botched by the government and subsequently stolen.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in poverty reduction.
But obviously, this has not prevented the intensification of the Ethiopian government’s internal resentment.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked businesses in Gondar, an Amharic city run by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights across neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin ridge."
Donald Trump declares his claim that Obama founded ISIS was “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, saying that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group was not meant to be serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s communication skills as to whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.
It also puts its collaborators, who strive to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he couldn’t have meant at all.
After making the hint at an election event on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump rowed back on Thursday’s claim, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely serious.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump attenuate the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn’t want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is crashing down on Mr. Trump as he tries to focus his campaign on the economic situation due to falling poll values.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this issue again.
Reporting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton’s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put forward sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he received strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton’s emails, but he later declared, “Of course I meant this sarcastically.”
This method allows Mr. Trump to push the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
“I think it’s one of his methods to test how certain messages are picked up by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, “clarify” depending on what the response is like,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who watches the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more corrosive tone as his poll scores continue to decline.
A new poll by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist published Friday showed a leadership with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But while he’s increasingly focused on attention in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes have put his loyal contenders in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trump’s most prominent advocates, made great efforts to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments,” Giuliani said, so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump’s statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backseat, completely wrong, and that’s why it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively bring the Middle East situation under control.
Prior to the Pennsylvania campaign on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He scoffed at the “poor, miserable” television experts who were trying to understand him and said, “You can’t!”
Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump’s apology as just another evidence that he was unsuitable for presidency.
Once over the price displaced from the market, cafe comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby cafe in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash that didn’t have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the prices have been pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie business, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted, “I know New York is change, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel excepted, and verb is now a soap business.”
But if New York is change, it is reinvention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and managing director of the new café.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new branch, he was excited to do so, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment too.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
“Many old customers have also been displaced by prices from Williamsburg,” he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited the verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
“I realized it was the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea instead of her usual iced coffee that day, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the verb in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they're preparing my everything-bal with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his everything-bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no resentment about the soap business taking over the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of the soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the cold brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient.
“I think we’ll still go into their offer,” Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon, making his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice shop wants to fill and sell the cold brewed coffee in bottles.
There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like returning home.
“I had to smell it,” he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a passion for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Water Turtle Soup.
His menu that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert a plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe’s last book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman, in her book 97 Orchard, talks about living in a house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, “A Decent Meal,” which will appear Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, untidy snack in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with pieces of olives, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with potato puree and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered Hackbraten, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of the Great Depression.
“Wealthy foods were very popular,” said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have been lying in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the cliff country.
“It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The new budget diet was just as tense: mysterious foods such as breads and cash rolls became staples, the cash roll as a "wonderful way to recycle food residue," noted Ziegelman, as chefs could hide unspeakable ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which has been the center of American cuisine for years, has become a rarely served luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious gratification took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at noon," Coe says.
Brickman continues, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.
It was typical of many of the housekeeping recipes.
As never before or ever since, household economists -- including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 -- so fueled the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "budget politicians" and to meet the challenge of turning pamps like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treats.
Especially tasty are the reports of the government’s response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s las-me-cake-eating attitude.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the million-dollar man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a smoking.
He was wonderfully unrealistic.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, hiring a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt led the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate.
Many of the species from the Great Depression era, dealing with food, were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple claimed to have better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother-in-law – for example, how she couldn’t throw away food.
“She had a real fear of wasting food,” Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “She actually made people sick.”
There was the windshield incident.
After the plates were cleared at Eisenberg's, she and Coe brought out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called Prune Whip,” said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to miss out on modest recipes with a fancy name.
There was no beaten cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon in the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn’t taste bad.
Coe got a lookup three times.
Like a can-do budgeter, he told his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others’ lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the White Helmets, a civil protection group that, according to Bild newspaper, has saved nearly 60,000 people.
2,900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil defender showing him in an 11-hour rescue of an infant from the rubble of a house went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
As a hero, however, he never saw himself, said according to the picture, "For me, this is the real jihad."
“When I die trying to save lives, I think God sees a martyr in me.”
Shortly before Omar himself was killed in an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffered from shortness of breath.
“We are now removing the toxic remains of the bomb so that children don’t play with it,” the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The Assad regime’s deadly bomb was supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrates are almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km/h through the North Atlantic - to this day.
Greenland sharks only have offspring at 150 years of age.
Gradually the Greenland shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed.
However, this slow-moving lifestyle seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" at least of a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks become stone-old.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers do not know much about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow motion pace when they equipped six animals with a transmitter outside Spitsbergen.
These sharks make prey anyway: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and seek out carcasses that tumble down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught from Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatches from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest was 502 centimeters long.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the sharks’ lens core using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens develops even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a remarkable amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth was therefore to be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts threw larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons experiments, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is produced by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeter long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark, at 502 centimeters, may even be 392 years old.
That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals at 392 centimetres was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks are evidently allowed to proliferate for at least one and a half centuries.
This is also a world record for vertebrates.
That such methusalms live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon was a 120-year-old harpoon tip at the neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on fire.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In addition, to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss from a gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"So a smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life.
Building land in a double pack
In the recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues relating to construction.
It was with relief that the panel took up Mayor Robert Putz’s message that “the marketing of the recently designated residential buildings can finally begin”.
After the land, plotting and development issues could be clarified and the applications for surveying were made, the sale of the land in the residential development areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (area Binderstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties is no longer in the way.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal equally to young families and staggering seniors.
As it was said, Bauwillige can now report to the city hall, about the allocation of the plots is expected to be discussed by the municipal council at its September meeting.
In order to be able to comply with requests for the settlement of further commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the new land use plan in sub-areas only in the spring of this year.
In the Unterzeitlarn area, the already designated industrial area is expanded by two plots in the direction of Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt profits from Brexit
In competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets Competence Unit.
According to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses can continue to operate financial transactions across the EU from London.
So far, the so-called EU passport is sufficient for them to be approved in the UK.
This is what big US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced that they will relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
The headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), which unites responsibility for monetary policy and oversight of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the Risk Board (ESRB), are speaking for Frankfurt.
Although the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
“The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can communicate directly with the supervisory authorities,” says IW professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, it does not perform as well as Dublin in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city scores with readily available commercial properties.
“It’s not so easy to find free high-quality offices in Paris,” Voigtländer says.
On the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking of the management consultancy Mercer, the city ranks seventh, Luxembourg ranks 19th, Dublin ranks 33rd and Paris ranks 37th.
Even if quality of life is a matter of preference: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," the IW concludes.
London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Brexit vote, the economic researchers say.
According to figures from the Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking industry in London at the end of 2015, while in Frankfurt there were 62,500.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. magistrate ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs it incurred from the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from $200 million in damages for violating two patents related to Gilead’s blockbuster drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on Merck’s part, including perjury and other unethical acts.
When the lawsuit was filed on Thursday, U.S. Attorney General Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to remission of the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck tries to match Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of laboratory work based on Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from Islamic State
US-backed troops have regained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last ISIS fighters in the city left it, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
Syria’s Democratic Forces (DKS) are combing through the city after the migration of the remaining group of fighters buried inside the city.
They have liberated over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, Sharfan Darwish told DKS-allied Manbij Military Council Reuters.
“The city is now under complete control, but we are doing clean-up work,” he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which yielded an income of $10.75 million for Democrat presidential candidate and her husband, and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speech fees; the former Secretary of State reported a $3 million income from publishing house Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton’s vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, has published his tax returns for the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdrawals regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required by law to do so.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
“They’re on the move,” Clinton’s campaign assistant Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the publication of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything until the tax checks are completed.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have already made it clear that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charitable organizations, his business stance, and various other ties, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already plunged on the subject and released a video on the internet Friday in which senior Republicans call on Trump to release his tax return.
On Thursday, she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last few decades and to publish his tax returns,” she told the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little taxes for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants Friday saying that might still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people earning more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During an election event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to meet to exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to an IRS tax check and Trump had “fear” of voters and not of tax authorities.
Clinton’s campaign has released tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The 2015 Clinton tax return showed that they only received $100 of their income as wages, unlike most of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which the Clintons taxed dividends and earnings of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to stop elephants from going to man-inhabited settlements - they throw condoms at them filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its support along with U.S. conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many spears were used to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
“Since we developed the ... toolkit, we have been able to observe a change in attitude within these communities, with them much more confident that they can keep the elephants off their fields without harming the elephant in doing so,” said Honeyguide’s managing director Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing it into a horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a fireworks body into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A breath is usually already out to drive out the elephant.
One last possibility is a thrower shooting a gold rainfire into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on the St. Goarer Rheinufer
Normally, the St. Goarer take on investment projects by traders with a kissing hand - since it is precisely the retail sector in the core city that is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the request for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but this kiosk is not suitable for this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli prefix was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list an Israeli prefix, as it “requested” Arab guests, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary “Shoah”, left out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel’s country code list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own call center.
Looking for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there “shocked him,” as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "intentional decision of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director.
“The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the prefix be deleted,” Lanzmann said.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a “great shame,” reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is an even greater shame.
That doesn't need an explanation.
We expect the hotel to "take the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident triggered quite a big reaction on the internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some suggested to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "submitted" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame," it said in another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations and called the incident an "accident" and "excused" Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
“There was never a direct instruction not to include Israel in the quick-choice list,” the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms for the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to Sao Paulo State Governor Geraldo Alckmin’s proposals, just under 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen spraying graffitits on walls against the provisional President Michel Temer.
The latest protests occurred a few days after protesters went out on the streets in masses to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote for her resignation.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade sales between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year on year.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are establishing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade sales between Russia and Iran rose by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and was $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent, amounting to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upswing was achieved by deliveries of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian foreign representation issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran has reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that last year’s record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia are being broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witness search: Beverage market in Waldbröl raided
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the Rewe XXL beverage market on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Under the charge of a firearm, three darkly dressed persons who had disguised their faces demanded cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW golf.
How much money has been stolen, the police do not say.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, i.e. relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible directly from the park deck of the Rewe market and is difficult to see.
After the robbery, the perpetrators must have run towards Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and escaped from the gravel parking lot opposite the entrance to the parking garage with the silver car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations in connection with the robbery at 7:45 p.m. should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and Fun in Summer Leisure
Eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational day group / social group work of the Kinderschutzbund Nagold with their caregivers on their summer free time in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quietly located leisure home Hardtwäldle, the happy group was settled during the first week of school holidays.
Several full-day trips were on the program.
On the one hand, we went to Bretten with a visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children’s tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Keltenmuseum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed the deep sea in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splash.
Culinary children and caregivers were pampered with their self-made body foods such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
Workshops were held to create beautiful pieces of jewellery from pearls and stones or to make a Roman mill game from wood.
Other highlights of leisure were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "coloured evening".
On the day of the return, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on their way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next Roman pilgrimage of all ministers in expected two years, the top ministers round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and the decision was finally made for the bishop's city of Freiburg, where a special pilgrimage destination was offered this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the opened gate of Mercy at Freiburg's Münster.
16 minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmer set out.
The evening before, Father Storost sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and granted the pilgrimage blessing.
From Horb the train was taken to the starting point Villingen, where there is also a Münster Unserer Lieben Frau and thus the pilgrimage route from the Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptures.
But also on the way the minis took rest at crossroads, chapels or churches to sing together a song from a special pilgrimage songbook.
For the overnight stays, parish halls of the local parishes were available.
At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, had to be descended in muggy heat at first about 500 meters of altitude and then climbed again.
The reward earned was a common barbecue at the bathwhirlpool in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter, we went on the final stage to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived later in the afternoon at Freiburg’s Münster and passed through the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked.
In the evening fair in Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were greeted by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home as Brite earns gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to fame in the men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio last night when the British team defended the title of London 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The young man made the legend proud when he stormed home to win a victory from the New Zealand favourites.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after only taking a modest sixth place at the London Rail World Championships in March, despite Hoys’ resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hinds showed up.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds, New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was a little behind after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy made up a big part of the transformation in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said, “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph on the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection from England’s rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said, "It feels like London with all the GB flags on the stand."
We have come together as a team over the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, that awaits us successful five days in the Velodrome.
With the form of Kenny, it is possible that he repeats Hoy’s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (an apparently sacred date for British sports; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born).
That would be the same as that of Hoy.
Kenny is next in the sprint, starting today and going for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, “I’m just enjoying this for the moment.”
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to be a knight."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the finish in 3:51,942.
The world record for winning gold in London in 2012 was 3:51,659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had argued with officers before qualifying yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advance in world record time in 4:13,260.
The GB team relies on its strong railway bike team to dominate the mid-period of the Olympics and win a host of medals.
After a truly extraordinary display of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were lowered.
Dramas took place in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, looking at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
The future of Portland smelting is questionable due to the repeal of the Energy Treaty
The future of Portland’s aluminum melting in Victoria – as well as hundreds of jobs of workers – is at stake as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus cancels all supply contracts, the supplying energy company said.
This step was followed by the government’s decision in Victoria earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs are at stake at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
No fewer than 2,000 jobs - both direct and indirect - could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelter in Portland loses money and risks a closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently as a result of the electricity price for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The facility is majority owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which CITIC and Marubeni Corp. hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, which means another physical demand for electricity from the smelter," the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts are so-called “security transactions” that should have entered into force as of November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"AGL therefore assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential impacts on revenue on AGL as of GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual close of $187 million in “expectation of termination.”
Alcoa said that the decision to cancel the contracts, the "capacity of Alcoa... to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter" did not affect.
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year, even though it still owes an explanation for why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn due to the poor economic conditions of the industry against the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
In reference to analysts’ statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago consumes around 900 megawatts of electricity.
Should both plants disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market].
And that would not be good for us as electricity generators,” he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris, is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s brand ambassador and running at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The cover was followed by a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for Rob and Caitlyn’s problem cases, as well as in the presence of the most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), as they have all planned a surprise.
This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of an animated rabbit in a radio station at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September edition of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall’s big sister Kim likes to beat her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league in itself.
The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.
With a volume that is more similar to a picture book than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages were advertised from the 832 pages of the Wälzer).
The revelation of his cover star is so longingly expected that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leaked even before the official announcement.
Women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been clearly more “models that are celebrities” on the cover than “models that are celebrities.”
Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the little chance that Ms. Jenner – who is described by the magazine as the “breakthrough model” of her generation – falls under the earlier category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or teens of today who know how to shoot a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone likes Jenner’s success.
With her reality TV story, Jenner’s position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling her "the cunts of the moment."
These feelings rekindled when the news came out with Jenner’s appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the displeasure seems to go by the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
In the truest sense of the word, she is a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's advertising your primer for Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time, she's on reality TV, probably just to see her sister Kourtney and their children.
Community Law Centers Reject 160,000 People Every Year
More than 160,000 of the country’s most in need are rejected by community law centers each year, while the industry is geared to the impact of further cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence, and those who do not have funds for unjust delogging and the like – are already dismissed from their application for free legal advice.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already excessively busy, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
Queesland community law center director James Farrell said the latest survey by the National Association of Community Law Centers revealed that thousands of people are already being rejected every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without repealing the federal government’s decision.
“Queensland’s community law centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being rejected from important services they need,” he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families who go through separations, workers who have been unfairly fired - all these people have legal issues and this survey shows they can't get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning thousands of people in need from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We urge the Attorney General and Federal Minister of Justice, as well as Queensland Senators George Brandis, to immediately lift these cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centers and their customer communities, as well as the government of Palaszczuk investing in this important work.
Donald Trump's election campaign charged after employee allegedly pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her North Carolina campaign leader pointed a gun at an employee in February while they were on a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed in Charlotte’s state court on Wednesday by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he waited for months for the matter to be resolved internally before realizing that “this wouldn’t happen.”
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drawn a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the run in Vincent's throat," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leaders, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment People” – gun owners and gun lovers – should take action in case his rival Hillary Clinton should be elected and appoint judges.
Trump’s campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini’s complaint demands damages from the campaign for breach of due diligence and from Philip for bodily injury and permanent mental damage.
Trump’s press spokeswoman Hope Hicks was unable to reach for a statement.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer an employee of the campaign.
Calls to his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded to.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has led a controversial campaign so far.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before country elections: SPD and CDU lose
The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September) result in significant losses for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild"-Zeitung (Friday).
While the red-black government coalition in the north could rule slightly further, this is not possible according to the poll values in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to appoint the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party would be just ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the state parliament for the first time with 19 percent.
Despite slight losses, the Greens returned to the Landtag in Schwerin with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3% each.
According to the poll, the SPD would only come to 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary election (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It was still behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, but the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times the weight of an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it wasn’t good in the hand either.
On the contrary, it was quite clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into stores exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the stone age of the internet age.
Twenty years ago, however, the Communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit computer trade fair in Hanover as a "office in the format of a vest pocket".
In fact, the new mobile phone could be a lot for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator could be reached.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, though tormentingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be opened up like a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one knew in August 1996 that the Communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Everything has been different since then.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The Finnish mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and settled.
The market now dominates vendors, all of which came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime, anywhere, that’s everyday for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide.
Approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, with Samsung and Apple accounting for 555 million units.
The worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there is the well-running business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications groups.
An entire industry has now emerged around the smartphone.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the iPhone at Mac World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone, and an Internet communicator, all easily operated via touch screen.
Apple’s triumphal march began, and today the iPhone is the company’s most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, had the check.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry has to fight.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are on the rise.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
“We all have to learn to put the smartphone away,” said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for personnel at Siemens.
Permanent access is now considered a curse and a blessing at the same time.
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was Heathrow’s biggest attraction, just as it was in London in 2012, when we did a lot of work to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
As they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong in Heathrow as well.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not individuals.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, $211 billion in lucrative growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a .11 billion-dollar infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row to the T2, built amidst the world's two most frequented catwalks.
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is backed by $16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will be one too.
It’s time for us to steer this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury.
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, attempts to bypass ad blocking are like a “cat and mouse game,” according to one of the software manufacturers.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocks on its desktop page, Adblock Plus released a blog post saying that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change coding regarding its ads to make it more difficult to detect ad blockings about which part of the page is ads.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of back-and-forth fight between the ad-blocking open source community and bypassers has been going on since the ad blockers were invented,” and that it’s possible that Facebook will soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying ad blockers have become for the industry.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile phone advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company is aiming for ad blockers on desktop PCs, as mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook’s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of revenue, so that Facebook seems to be worth investing in such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced it would update its “ad preference tool” to give people more control over ads targeted at them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblocking new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that isn’t advertising.
“This is not a positive experience for users, so we plan to address the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
Ad blockers are a dull means, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people’s hands.
Woman hit Swiss highway in suspicious suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police call witnesses after a woman was hit on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the street in the dark "in an act of despair" and was hit by several cars, police said in Vaud.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was hit by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, police said, calling these as well as any witnesses of the incident to report.
An investigation was opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told the Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision preventable?
That’s something the prosecutor has to decide,” Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In either case - where a person was running on the highway in the dark - it was decided that the drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is walking on the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing after she ran over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, the court heard.
The court noted that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- was driving in a justified manner and that a man's presence on the street was "a perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police on the number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA Climate Model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-tight atmosphere, once had Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously hinted that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet slowly turned on.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to harbor life and protect it from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matte.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its day side of the sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the sun’s heat.
The result is average temperatures that are a few degrees cooler than Earth’s today.
The model produced a history of Venus similar to the evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although once thought habitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy Resigns as Avalanche Coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche, leading a lack of right to co-determination in the team’s decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
Over the summer, I’ve been thinking a lot and a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, that it needs, and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of co-determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me of this decision today,” Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach in the league during his 2013-14 Avalanches debut season.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota playoffs and missed the off-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season and fell behind the wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As a Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labor struggles regarding the remuneration for North Sea oil workers will be suspended as all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were sporadically carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute,” a joint statement said.
We will hold some full-day meetings over the next few weeks, which will begin early next year, to reassert the problems.
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut its contractors’ rates in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company’s rate cut follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell has fired thousands of people for its part and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude prices, an economic situation that had intensified with the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with workers’ leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that has taken place in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for few,” he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures rotational rate of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars rotate in the cluster at different rates and how the rotational periods relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters of stars, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The Pleiades star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, which was formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
You're turning the fastest now.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of star winds.
Because these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a decelerating effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotational rate of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slower than smaller.
"In the Pleiades' ballet, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us that we would like to learn more about, how the how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang their "dance shoes", so to speak.
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotational rates of the Pleiades, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star resigns
Alex Rodriguez’s tears went faster than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation, the 41-year-old professional will wear the jersey of his New York Yankees one last time against the Tampa Bay Rays on August 12.
“I love this game and this team.
“I say goodbye to both,” said the 14-time all-star game participant of Major League Baseball (MLB).
Three times Rodriguez was voted the most valuable player in the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature under a ten-year contract has earned him $27 million annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on December 31, 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back for a long time with performance.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004), and since 2005 the Yankees, he achieved some milestones.
With the Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar figures in the most important statistics.
However, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the hall of fame of baseball.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nickname "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance outside the court.
As early as 2009, the superstar at ESPN admitted to taking banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was suspended for 211 games by the end of 2014 due to a involvement in the so-called biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is the main suspect in having received performance-enhancing drugs for years through an anti-aging clinic in southern Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was reduced to 162 encounters.
“The league could even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break,” Rodriguez said.
His farewell days are not silent either.
While many baseball legends get the big stage again in their last games, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
“My job doesn’t include a farewell tour.”
“My job involves trying to win every game,” Yankees coach Joe Girardi said.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have a relationship with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy from fans of Yankee arch-rival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod", the supporters sang in the 4-9 defeat against the Rodriguez team.
2016 Olympics: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
An athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases have become known at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positive and excluded in Brazil - just before the start of the already critically watched athletics competitions, these news come to the fore.
In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Sports Court CAS confirmed on Friday afternoon local time its exclusion from the Olympic Games.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
Chen should have participated in the 50-metre freestyle runs on Friday.
Chen has requested the opening of the B-probe and a hearing with the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands Chen full cooperation in the investigations," Xinhua quoted from a communication: "We will cooperate with the CAS International Sports Court and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also in the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa sifted through, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive,” she told Bulgarian TV channel BNT.
She is innocent, “the only explanation could be dietary supplements,” the athlete said.
According to the report, the banned substance is the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekowa has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample has already been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borissov immediately expressed criticism of the athlete.
“I don’t understand why the athletes don’t draw the right conclusions,” he said, “we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded.”
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-laden nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case "Adrian Zielinski" was also known, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier, like his brother Tomasz.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekowa case in particular is another heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF had banned the launch of the entire Russian team except for one exception because of systematic doping, and the Kenyan Runners also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous offenses in China had also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
Camille Lacourt attacked Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang peeing purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to surrender," Lacourt told French radio.
Sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Australian Mack Horton.
“I have no time and no respect for doping scammers,” he said.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the 2014 Chinese championships, but only had to sit a three-month ban.
This is how perfide hackers blackmail their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies – and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past 12 months were at least once, sometimes multiple times, victims of an attack using blackmail software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
According to malwarebytes, the perpetrators are increasingly specializing in attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potential ransom to be blackmailed is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently witnessing a terrifyingly rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in a conversation with the "world".
In 2008, most malware programs were designed to send advertisements.
Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the switch to corporate attacks was frighteningly fast in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim’s computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and permanently delete the originals.
The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.
In order to get the end-encryption code to the files, victims need to transfer money – mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
However, where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is at a standstill.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the German companies affected reported revenue losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business activities, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals have been victims of attacks several times, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
For managers, it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of a downtime in operation.
The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure security researchers have examined user interfaces and contact with blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take in more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how to pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work, security expert Chester Wisniewski from antivirus provider Sophos explains: “A single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week.”
However, it is more likely that they are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software builder to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by purchasing the malware itself, advice and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"Included is a customization tool, so smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers are then looking for more hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and commission another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
“Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread it,” Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better secure their data.
More than 50 percent of the company’s IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to ward off ransomware using file backups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
“If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful epidemics, the perpetrators instead threaten to release sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations,” explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the type of data, the damage potential is therefore many times higher than before.
In the future, the perpetrators could also take on completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacking conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom for so many victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.
One for all
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty overloaded, but the HR-V, which was built on the same new platform as the new Jazz, actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not seem tight at any point.
The materials of the interior are well-processed and look pleasant, only the cockpit surface falls off a bit.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.
Not only is a trunk of 453 l available for high-ranking and 1026 l for folded backrests, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinema chairs, thus providing storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height is slightly higher at 650 mm than with the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.
He should do his work a little quieter.
The daily consumption is gratifying of 4.7 l/100 km.
There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The driving behaviour is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering is probably a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to Tempo 32), the Collision Warning System and the Track Retaining Assist.
The collision warner sometimes irritates because he rated many obstacles as "approaching objects" while ranging.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent temporator responds to traffic sign recognition and reduces the speed if necessary.
Full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and an HDMI socket are under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to achieve.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel is fine.
Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines comply with the Euro-6 exhaust gas standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only conceivable in the case of hazards that are typical for air traffic, the Oberlandesgericht Düsseldorf argued (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap during the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general life risk, the court said.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Sickness: When does the organizer pay?
Sick holidaymakers will only receive money back after their trip if the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without any doubt.
But this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have been shown to show the same symptoms.
In the case negotiated, a family was severely diagnosed with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkey vacation.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
The holidaymakers attributed their illness to a defective sewage treatment plant that allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the trip was defective - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs were unsuccessful.
In fact, the sewage treatment plant was defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
By then, he had to assume that the seawater was fine.
He did not violate his information obligations, the ruling said.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly due to infection with each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people would be worried about further attacks.
The state must react deliberately and resolutely at the same time to terrorist threats.
Our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this victory to the terrorists.
But if offenders had to leave the country faster, this would increase security and also strengthen the public’s acceptance of the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further reinforcement of the security forces “on a medium four-digit scale over several years.”
Advertising for terrorism must be punished again.
Video surveillance is to be improved, arms law to be revised in such a way that, above all, the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The most recently discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be maintained according to de Maizière's words.
However, he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical community to reduce the danger to citizens, he said with regard to psychological abnormalities, for example.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister believes that better social care is necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared to deal with traumatized people.
In order to prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans the use of covert investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: “The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security.”
It is important that the Interior Minister has clearly opposed actionism.
"That was a whip for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Media Group (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship.
He considers a general ban on full concealment to be constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I refuse to wear the burka.
You can talk about rules, for example, in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Greens chief Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate energy and ability to act with ever new anti-terrorism packages.
Left-wing leader Bernd Riexinger said: “Flotte of sayings and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to people in this country.”
Improved traffic flow on the motorway
It regularly piles up on the bypass - here is a picture of November.
But that should change: the right turn lane should be extended.
This is good news for all car drivers who are in traffic on the local road every evening when they drive over the motorway (A 43).
On Tuesday and Wednesday (16/17 August) the regional road construction company extends the right-hand lane between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit by 700 meters.
Drivers can then thread directly from Hammer Road to the right.
The big advantage: the traffic divides up earlier, which improves the overall process on the busy section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder annoys the motorists especially between 5 and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backstop extends to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, the traffic is directed only one-lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled just over a quarter of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load-bearing capacity to accommodate heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
How long this congestion and the associated working-day congestion will last, the responsible national company cannot say.
However, years can be expected: because the bridge has an official residual useful life until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right turn lane, the state company has deliberately chosen the traffic weaker time in the school holidays, because there is to be expected with disabilities.
The traffic is one-lane on Tuesday and Wednesday past the construction site.
Intercultural Travel: Cultural Offers for Schools
The international class of the forest school attended the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's club and the Junge Theater are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus visited a performance of the award-winning piece "Das unsichtbare Haus" of the Junges Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of 11 and 15 visited the production in the Small House.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most of the class came to Münster from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic pictures and video animations, they were still able to follow the course of the story, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junge Theater will cooperate in the coming season as part of a music theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migration background between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dance, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are in the planning.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
Given the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: hope for weather improvement
The weather has made the star-sniffing gamblers in southwest Germany a stroke through the bill during the night to Friday - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited to watch the sky spectacle due to clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather is supposed to be good, so we'll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
The stellar sheds are Perseids, which are among the fastest star shoots at 216,000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep.
This is anything but restful.
After all, you are in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent often or permanently feel that their sleep is not restful.
What are sleep problems or sleep disorders?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be caused by a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, a member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this, however, is insomnia, i.e. a sleep disorder.
It is precisely the sleep-through that many people find unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a member of the board of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This can be caused by organic, psychological or behavioral factors, as well as medications.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is especially common with depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors affect each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and perhaps start to wonder about everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is impaired in the day should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment can look quite different: one is down, tired, sleepless, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headaches.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any settled sleep physicians in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, in case of sleep problems, one should first contact the family doctor, advises Weeß.
It can be used to determine whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors recommend, for example, snoring with breathers, sick daytime fatigue, sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of a sleep disorder, explains Fietze.
You don’t really have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
“Please don’t sleep for lunch,” says Fietze.
After the wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, one wears noseglasses, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a lot of adjustment screws that can be used for a better sleep.
Weess counts on: Regular sleeping and rising times, not lying in bed for too long, not sleeping in the day, not watching television to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you immediately start to calculate, and this is not at all conducive.
What the jungle camp has to do with missing medals in swimming
The former German swimmer Markus Deibler has spoken on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had won gold for the first time at the World Short-Track Championships in Doha and set his first world record at the same time.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has stood up via Facebook protecting against his criticized ex-teammates.
“In a country where an Olympic champion gets €20,000 premium and a jungle king €150,000, no one should be surprised about missing medals,” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page.
The promotion system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This means that we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not look so closely at the topic of doping or even do it.
“I’m not saying that the controls should be stopped here,” he continued.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported to the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA) nine months before his first start.
This is exactly how it should be done with countries.
"If you cannot be controlled by independent WADA/FINA inspectors for a certain time before the World Cup/OS, you are not allowed to participate," demands the Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlor.
Airport: Gang of Luggage Thieves Arrested
Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport
Dusseldorf police officers succeeded in arresting two women and two men between the ages of 50 and 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as a gang.
Around 9:30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the policemen from past theft offences.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year and had taken part in the community, in part and in a particularly professional way.
The Specialists of the Criminal Commissariat 34 can prove four acts to the thieves who had specifically entered Germany for the purpose of committing crimes.
They had taken over 15,000 euros in total.
Old buildings, a few linden trees, a few cobblestones in between: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like it at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a organic shop.
On the facade of a grey house someone sprayed "ugly!"
Opposite by a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
Articles about this "critical district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, are, however, preferably illustrated with burning cars in the last weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Since the beginning of the year, Berlin’s interior senator Henkel has repeatedly spoken out in favour of a harsh action by the police against the project, calling the area a “no-go zone” for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, were cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements, with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on site, blocked parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers moved away under the cheer of sympathizers and local residents.
On this summer afternoon the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before late.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the district since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are especially annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects they share the concern of increasing rents and gentrification.
It doesn’t sound like a vote, the majority of which wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The trench that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between house occupiers and their neighbors does not seem to exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today still has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
House occupancy and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the Kiez: In 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Rigaer.
While the Mainz had been evacuated under heavy police orders in a veritable street battle, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still partly inhabited today by the people they occupied 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and electoral Berliners from all over the world: with them, residents from the GDR period and former home occupiers now share their neighborhood.
This is also evident in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 for new rentals.
Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognizable by thrown-in slices or freshly painted facades that have been cast with color bags.
No other road has been mentioned so often this year along with the words “left-wing autonomous violence”.
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as personal injury are reportedly almost exclusively targeted at police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As far as violence is concerned, it is reassuring: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, who certainly weren’t.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed in Riga for a long time now.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else".
Neugebauer deliberately moved into Rigaer Straße - and remained.
That’s why it was so important to her that the locals get their road back: from the police, the politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed interpretation sovereignty over the district.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building holes that displace the old residents.
“Ultimately, these are condominiums that are not of interest to many here – they are more likely to be home to people who aren’t as busy,” she says.
"I can't approve of violence and destruction at all."
What should you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For those who are upset about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiez.
Those who come here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district can complain badly about noise there.
All people presented only by first name have asked not to be named by their real name.
Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.
The social educator supports the administration team led by Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, the refugee aid working group, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine’s client from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here now, the egg-laying wool milk sauce, which has a problem above all.
For example, some had meant - less ridiculous than targeting the multitude of desired tasks - than the administration wanted to advertise the position.
An administrative professional with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought, just an egg-laying wool milk sauce.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50 percent post for three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Customer, who supports Annika Deushle's honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
Soon new containers will be in the Wasenstraße
It has been a serious problem for some time now to find homes for the following refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the connection accommodation.
They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented housing.
The costs of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the county office to the municipality and job centre.
Problem: There are free properties, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time now.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not work yet, depending on private homes, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, communal dwellings need to be apprenticed, as it is so beautifully said.
So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.
But it is not only with homes that it is done.
Perspective is the key word, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent stay, these are internships, training places, school places, one-euro jobs and relief activities for refugees and migrants that need to be found or set up.
“More seats would be good,” reports Regine customer.
Many work in the Bauhof or help caretakers, do charitable work - and that is motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that working for the community will lead to a positive outward impact.
It's not "employment therapy."
Activity is not just work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
The administration and volunteers are also involved.
It is central that the refugees feel that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, should not work and be useless, he will never integrate.
The vast majority are motivated.
However, there are also problems, says the customer honestly, "people who can do nothing at all". The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All of this is a “mammut task.”
A difficult question: After the recent events, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some may call naive". A residual risk can and does not exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also the subject of refugees.
They are afraid that the attackers will completely discredit them.
“They want to show that they have nothing to do with it,” says Regine customer.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
Therefore, main and volunteers must be on the lookout for activities on the ground and in the region.
They always have in mind that soon a new surge of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
To answer this question clearly, politics is shy.
In fact, it is unfair to put them on the ground.
"We haven't arrived in Urbach yet where we wanted to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine’s customer also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the previous people reasonably.
That’s around 100 people at the moment, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political situation in the world is so complicated, there are no simple answers.
Schorndorf: burglar with helicopter wanted
The police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men invaded an apartment in an apartment building in the Lindenweg at about 8.50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and fled the mob.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wearing blue jeans and black hooded pullovers.
They fled to the city center.
The police deployed several patrol crews and a police helicopter.
The search was unsuccessful.
Possibly the unknowns stood out before the act near the apartment or when they fled.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigated after rocker attack on snacks
After an attack on an Ulm snack, the police investigate six suspects from the Rocker environment for serious breach of peace.
Evidence and drugs were secured during searches, police said on Friday.
Around 20 masked men of a rocker-like group had thrown bottles and stones against the window pane of a snack bar, according to police in July.
After that, they attacked two guests and injured one slightly.
Then they fled.
At the snack bar and the adjoining building a damage of 10000 euros occurred.
According to the investigators, it is a dispute in the Ulm rock environment between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
